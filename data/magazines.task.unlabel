My husband and I started with a free subscription to this magazine and fell in love with it. We both read it from cover to cover 
I've been a subscriber to Body + Soul magazine for about a year now, and I look forward to each new issue. The magazine focuses on many areas of interest to me, including healthy eating, holistic health, fitness, and personal growth. The articles frequently feature practical things like recipes, buying guides, yoga or other fitness instructions, and emotional exercises (the latter of which I find particularly helpful in my work as a psychologist). My only complaints about this magazine is that there is a bit too much of a focus on spiritual/meditation type issues, which are less relevant to me, and that the magazine is on the short side with a high number of advertisements. Otherwise, I definitely enjoy Body + Soul and do plan to renew my subscription. 
"Following our dreams is about setting an intention, taking the necessary steps to bring it to life, and then letting the force of serendipity take over." ~Alanna Fincke, Editor Marianne Williamson once said: "You can let the same force that makes flowers grow and planets move run your life, or you can do it yourself." With that in mind, I read Body + Soul to awaken the side of me that allows for such healing contemplations. Articles about living your dreams and the small-farm comeback give me hope for the future. The recent article about Beauty by the Sea is pure fun with ideas for sand scrubs, meditation while waves kiss your legs and nourishing hair treatments. They also give a list of "inspiring beach reads." Having trouble sleeping? This magazine always has ideas for how you can become healthier and presents ideas and products that unlock secrets of health. A sample of July/August 2006 contents include: Whole Living - Recipes for green tea ice cream Rejuvenate - Herb baths for cooling the skin in summer Going Natural - Meditation Eat Well - Teas made with herbs like peppermint Conscious Eating - Breaking bad habits Healthy Home - Selecting the best pillow Whole Health - Healing for asthma and learning to love the body you have Inner Growth - Identifying spiritual road blocks and finding instant calm I love their idea about an "action plan." This section gives ideas for how to make a difference in your life with the ideas in this magazine. If you have an interest in organic produce, yoga, healthy herbal supplements or anything natural and nurturing, you might love this magazine. ~The Rebecca Review 
The mag is truly great. I love curling up with some tea or relaxing in the tub while I read it. It has great tip for a balanced life with focus on stress reduction, eating right, and keeping fit. There is a homeopathic medicinal side to the mag, but it is balanced by science based artilces. Great mag. Highly recommended if you like to live a balanced life. Also has great artilces about people dealing with issues we all deal with and inspirational thoughts. 
This isn't a magazine that's preachy or tries to tell you that the western way of life is bad. It simply offers multiple ways of looking at things, whether it's fitness, food, spirituality, or something else. I appreciate the open-minded way Body Soul seems to approach its articles. I tend to dog-ear the interesting pages in my magazines, and with this one I always seem to dog-ear almost every other page! The other thing I appreciate about this magazine is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Just goes to show you can be slightly irreverent and still get an intelligent point across. Kudos to Body Soul! (p.s. You can't even tell it's a Martha magazine -- I didn't realize it until I saw the other reviews on this page, who apparently thought it was going to be another MTL or something 
I remember when this magazine was the lone Conservative voice on the newstands. I too have memories of many long Latinate sentences which Mr.Buckley provided and I had to try and figure out. It is not that I always agreed, much less understood him. But I did feel that he was a man walking to the sound of his own drummer, who had a real concern for public life in America, and his own ideas of how to make it better. I also saw through the years that he edited a very intelligent opinion- journal which explored many aspects of American reality. The magazine today seems to me still to be of high- quality, though Mr. Buckley is no longer at the helm. 
The magazine is being delivered as per the agreement. Some people especially the avowed liberals would not want this magazine as this presents a strong conservative viewpoint. 
This is a great foodie magazine. We think the writing is what makes it great. It is always interesting, has some recipes to try and is not the usual food mag stuff. Very enjoyable 
What a beautiful magazine (full color pictures on glossy paper), and what interesting stories behind each food. The recipes are sometimes doable, although most of the time I just like to read about the exotic ingredients in each. A must have- makes the living room look very sophisticated 
I love how they focus on a particular region and give background on the food and the people. I am still drooling over their visit to Ireland's famed dairy region. I must get my hands on some of that butter. It seems as if, the writers took the time to get to know the people and infuse their personalities into the recipes 
This is simply a beautiful magazine, printed on heavy, glossy paper. Its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods, wines, and the countries from which they originate. It is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow, it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries, their food and wine, their restaurants, and their culture. Usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about. The articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information. I am a tea lover, and I love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones, dainty sandwiches, and light cakes. So, I particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea. It transported the reader to Devon, England with its afternoon tradition of tea and scones, accompanied by clotted cream and jam, which is often referred to as a cream tea. Of course, a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea. This, too, is discussed in the article. Photographs of an authentic village tearoom in Devon were included, as well as recipes for making scones, tea sandwiches, black currant jam, strawberry jam, and Victoria Sponge Cake. The article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made. It interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream. A guide was included for Devon in terms of where to stay, where to eat, and where to go for tea. The article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences, detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea, a cream tea, and a high tea, and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each. I so enjoyed this article! Even if I never physically go to Devon, I feel as if the magazine had transported me there, as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand. The magazine has these types of articles in every issue, covering regions from all over the world, including those in the United States. The magazine also contains a helpful section titled, "The Pantry", which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine. This makes it invariably easier for the reader, who may wish try some of the more esoteric recipes, to find what one needs. It is little wonder that I love this magazine. Those who are interested in wonderful food, excellent and easy to follow recipes, other cultures and customs, as well as traveling, will simple adore this magazine. It makes a wonderful gift. I know, because this magazine was a gift to me and one for which I am grateful, as it is a gift that one gets to enjoy again and again, each and every month. 
Delicious recipes, color photos, travel background, ingredients sources, well written articles and the ads are not designed to make you rip the magazine apart like a certain 'no ads' magazine. Sometimes the contributing authors are a little full of themselves, but overall the writing is excellent and the food is authentic to the region being written about. Its a touch expensive direct from Saveur, but a good deal on Amazon 
I love this magazine because it gives the background and history of food. When I get the magazine each month,I have to read it right then and there. I finally found out where Salisbury Steak originated. In Ohio, by a doctor during the Civil War. Not in England. The photography is beautiful and some of the stories are memories of what the certain food means to them. They make you want to try everything in the magazine. Saveur is not pretentious as "Food and Wine" or "Gourmet." It is nice to read about regular people that make great food at reasonable expenses. Subscribe to this magazine 
A great magazine for digital camera users from beginner to expert. Has great tips and information 
I got a subscription to this magazine as a gift and at first glance, thought it was going to be nothing but lightweight glossy fluff mainly meant to push new products. To be fair, there are plenty of lightweight reviews of new products in each issue, but there are also a surprising number of very useful, practical how-to articles-- mainly geared to novice or intermediate digital photographers (like me!). Yes, I've purchased big thick books on Photoshop before, but somehow, I never gotten to far in actually reading those books (maybe too much info for a hobbiest who doesn't need/won't use 1/2 the features in the product?). I recently switched from using Photoshop to using Photoshop Elements, and this magazine seems to be a nice compliment to that software package. In recent issues, I've learned when and how to effectively use RAW vs JPG, how to take better advantage of graduated ND filters, how to use Levels correctly, etc. The contributing editors are all top-rate as are the photographs and examples. I highly recommend anyone with a new digital SLR and/or new PC image software such as PS Elements, to get this magazine. It's well worth the subscription 
This is one of the best magazine for learning how to take great pictures with your digatal camara 
This magazine is great for beginning to intermediate digital camera users. I think that it is especially great for beginners. There are articles about how to choose the right camera for your purpose and about what all the specifications mean. There are question and answer sections that answer a broad range of questions including how to avoid common computer errors and how to format different digital devices. I like the photo editing tips, which explain some of the more elusive aspects of most digital photo editing programs and how to use them. The photo-editing program described most often is adobe photoshop and photoshop elements; however, quick advice is also give about how to apply these tips to other programs. For more advanced film camera users, there are tips for how to make the same quality image with a digital camera and stories of professional photographers who have switched to digital. However, most professional photographers will use macs to edit their photos rather than PCs and more advanced photo editing software. Mostly this magazine caters to amateur photographers and the lower end photo-editing programs that are most often used. There are also reviews of new gadgets, which are often fun to read, and plenty of market place like advertising in the back. This magazine is what it advertises and nothing more 
The target audience of this magazine is really for those interested in keeping up on etiquette and the status of the social circles around the country. I have been reading it for about ten years and I love it. Not only have I learned a tremendous amount but I have been inspired by it's helpful articles and beautiful photographs. Thank you 
I started reading iCreate with the very first issue and haven't stopped yet. I had recently purchased an iBook for my sister in an effort to bring her into the 21st century but for all of the ease the Mac offers, my sister still wasn't really doing anything but using email...and even then maybe once a week. I picked up a copy of iCreate for her when it first came out. I liked it because it was written in plain english and it seemed that every page was a tutorial. Well it is 11 issues later and I am still hooked on this magazine. My sister has her own web page and is a master if the iLife program..all thanks to iCreate magazine. I read it too,,,love the disc and the articles. I find that it is better than Mac Addict (which hurts to say) and some of the other Mac mags. This magazine is geared towards the beginner to intermediate user but I'll tell you...even experianced users will enjoy it 
I picked up a copy at a local book store strictly for the article on networking and found a lot more useful items included. If you're into Macs for using the iLife and similar software, there are a ton of good "tutorials" included in each issue. Newstand price was $15.50, so it's more on the order of buying a paperback book instead of a magazine. Content is excellent--I found things in the tutorials that even the local Apple store didn't give in their classes 
I have found "Your Dog" very interesting and informative. I am glad I subscribed and plan to resubscribe. This is a no advertising (which is very refreshing) scientifically-based mag which is very helpful for dog lovers. 
This journal is a great resource for readers who are serious about their dogs. Articles are usually scientifically-researched and include health, training, and behavior issues. There are occasional reviews of dog-friendly products as well. This journal is well worth the money. Those who prefer holistic medicine may want to balance this subscription with a subscription to "Whole Dog Journal." 
House and Garden is a no-holds barred celebration of great *design*, primarily of interiors -- and to a lesser extent "gardens" and exteriors -- but also of product and architecture, with a smattering of coverage dedicated to artistans, travel, wine, and music. There is a spirit of high playfulness and arch but subtle, airy sensuality pervading H ... seems to me it's published by artistic souls for artistic souls ... if you want pedantic, safe, predictable, go for Traditional Home, House Beautiful, even Martha Stewart's Living or one of the other, more mainstream magazines. While it's true that not all of the issues are standouts -- the issues published around the end-of year holidays are generally thin and somewhat wan compared to the Spring and Fall issues, when staff are doubtless away on vacations and content must undoubtedy suffer -- overall House Garden hits it out of the park more often than not. Like Domino, it's newer, younger cousin in the field of "shelter magazines", it breathes the fresh air up there -- up above the cluttered field of clone publications which all proscribe the same cookie cutter "look" for homes -- and succeeds beautifully. H is a real little monthly armchair primer on what's new and noteworthy in the field of residential design and related topics ... blissfully free of tiresome, ubiquitous celebrity coverage (the recent cover article on Jade Jagger notwithstanding). Even the font -- a clean, stylish Art Deco -- nods towards the knowing. Highly recommended! 
Yo he leido varias revistas o magazines como tambien les llaman tales como,Seventeen, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Self, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Teen, Lucky, Teen Vogue, Marie Claire, por mencionar algunas,tanto las versiones en ingles como en espaol y definitivamente me quedo con Elle.Es superior a las demas, primera tiene excelente fotografia y muy buenas impresiones, su moda es cosmopolita y global, ademas de que presenta diseadores nuevos que aun todavia no son conocidos pero gracias a esta revista sus carreras son impulsadas rapidamente a la fama, sus propuestas y reviews sobre cine, musica, libros y teatro tambien son muy buenos,tiene cultura pop pero no es del tipo teenybopper como en otras revistas que se obsesionan con ciertas actrices o cantantes y de ahi no salen. Sus paginas de moda son preciosas aunque es cierto que muchas de las modelos que salen posando en estas paginas se ve que son anorexicas o le entran a las drogas, tampoco me gusta el precio de muchas de estas ropas y accesorios ya que por lo general van de 2000 a 1 millon de dolares, por favor pongan algo mas accesible y economico.Tambien tiene articulos de interes para todos, ya sea de salud,relaciones,sexo,belleza,politica,cultura o decoracion, estos son variados algunos son muy buenos, otros aburridos, otros son superficiales o estupidos, y otros son solo trivialidades. Pero en definitiva esta revista es muy buena, pero eso si es muy elitista, esta hecha para mujeres con estilo propio, que tienen educacion de colegio o universidad, que se visten para ellas mismas no para los demas, a diferencia de Cosmo, Glamour, y Marie Claire que claman ser feministas y en lugar de eso son antifeministas o pseudo feministas, Elle si les da un buen lugar a sus lectoras, en lugar de llenarles el cerebro con puro sexo y tarugadas de como contentar a tu hombre, amigo o lo que sea, y convertirte en una Barbie para el como dicen estas revistas que acabo de mencionar 
I'm pretty critical and picky about the magazines I read and Elle is one of the few that raise the standards. A lot of the information given, whether its clothes or advice, is very practical 
I love ELLE magazine! It's better than Vogue, in my opinion, because Vogue is all about too expensive clothes that only rich people can afford, too many damn pages it's basically a picture book more than anything. It's filled with nothing but advertisements pictures of anorexic models. I get bored reading/looking at it fast. Elle on the other hand, has articles that are informative more affordable designer clothes are shown. Beauty fashion is featured, but so is some great reading material. 
People building serious MS apps, the kind where you have to figure out just what "volatile" really means, must subscribe. This is the map to the world they live in. There are lots of ads, covering just about every add-in, add-on, API, component, and service you can imagine, plus some. Do you need to know the difference between clusters, multiprocessor board, multicore, hardware multithreading, and application multithreading? You need this. UI, I18N, .NET, COM compatibility - sooner or later, it's all here. However, not all of us work as MS app developers. If you live outside that world, you'll find just about nothing of interest. //wiredweir 
Great magazine. Covers the full range of .NET technologies. Every issue is packed with windows, web, and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more. High recomended 
Entrepreneur magazine is an easy read that allows us working professionals to have access to fresh ideas and interesting articles.I consider it a bargain given the amount and quality of information I receive for about a buck. There are a lot of ads and subscription offers to deal with, but that seems to be the case with most media. I do not consider this a substitute for reading books on business. It is a good complement however 
Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future. What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate. On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics. Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled "Sources" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue. Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day. 
Though the magazine does have the MLM and "You To Can Get Rich" articles, it has validity. You can do anything if you find the right thing, something your passionate about. I've found the articles may not always fit my exact situation, but I can extract what is meaningful or useful to fit my unique situation or business needs. Isn't that the main goal here? You have to find it, no one is going to hand it to you. Do the research and the work and ask for mentoring. Follow up on the leads and ideas they give you. I truly enjoy this magazine. Carpe Diem 
This is the best of the best of the rags out there. Reader beware: not everything you read is the truth. I love to thumb through this magazine from cover to cover and can't wait to receive it in the mail each week. The pictures are fun to look at and it's simple, mindless reading! From the newest styles that the stars are wearing to the latest make-up craze and new fangeled products out there, this magazine will give it all to you. Not to mention who's doing what and with whom in Tinseltown! So... get your own subscription today! Note: you save almost .50 off the cover price at the stores 
I have been a faithful Star reader for the past few years and sometimes their stories are right on the money. Now that Star is glossy, they really try to give Us Weekly a run for their money. I love the new glossy star, but don't like the higher price tag, so if you can afford a subscription it's worth it. They tend to cover the usual suspects as far as celebrities, and rarely do they cover human interests stories that don't have to deal with tinseltown, but if you want to read about -Kirstie Alley, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, The Olsen Twins, and the usual suspects you will enjoy this mag 
EVERYONE NEEDS A LITTLE FUN AND THIS MAGAZINE DELIVERS EVEN IF THE STORIES AREN'T ALWAYS TRUE IT'S FUN TO READ AND ISN'T TO HEAVY TO DIGEST. GREAT PHOTOS AND GOSSIP. I LOVE THE FASHION PAGES AND THE WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!! PHOTO' 
are you sick of those annoying game magazines that give only opinionated b.s instead of real reviews? are you sick and tired of having a game magazine latch on to one console and ignore all the others? are you sick of overrated games getting good reviews simply because they are hyped up? well so was I and I can honestly say that play delivers. you can tell when your reading a review that the reviewer actually played the game.I also applaud play for saying that grand theft auto is overrated (duh ive been saying that for 2 years) and I havent even gotten to the anime section..yes the people who write these reviews write them just as well as the game reviews. they treat anime as a serious form of art which is something I appreciate all in all if you want a game zine that rates games based on how good they actually are...then here you g 
Play magazine is consistently one of the best, if not the best, in its field. Well produced and always well written, it covers gaming and Anime as serious art with the respect they deserve 
Play is definitely a breath of fresh air for someone who was truly engulfed in second-hand suck. For years magazines like EGM, and GamePro (shudder), were the only multi-platform magazines I would read. I later became tired of their increasing ridiculousness, both in content and reviews, so after being suggested I check out this magazine from many fellow gamers I decided, hesitantly, to do so. I mean how different could another multi-platform magazine be? Very. Not only am I captivated by the wonderful choice of cover art each month (Amazon should change the display cover over to the Shadow of the Colossus one), but the pages and size of the publication are more professional than any gaming mag currently out. (I admit to not having read Game Informer, and due to their Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door fiasco, I never intend to.)I could only think of myself stupid for not heeding the words of others sooner. My first copy was issue 39, March 2005, and Sega was the choice for cover and main content of the month. Wow, was there content. A nice spread on Sega's upcoming lineup, and interviews with company people/developers captivated me more. And the reviews were awesome, and still are awesome as well, sometimes spilling over to 2 pages more frequently than "competitors." I knew right away this was what I was looking for: A magazine that liked all kinds of games and wasn't afraid to show it in both previews and in reviews, and a magazine that did not insult my intelligence, nor choice of games. I have not seen one word of "Kiddie" or "Baby Game" in attack because of colorful sprites, or lighthearted content. Quite the contrary, the magazine seems ardent in its protection of 2-D games, and games that are just fun regardless of how they look; something very welcome in this day and age of gaming. I also like how they can have some biting criticism, but still seem upbeat. Take their 2005 E3 wrap-up issue where they criticized everything from the show itself, to the phantom games, to the specs of the next-gen hardware, but still had positive things to say about them. Not only that, but the magazine had, once again, incredible coverage. How about some interviews with people such as: Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear; Boktai), Tomonobu Itagaki (DOA; Ninja Gaiden), Atsushi Inaba (Viewtiful Joe; Okami), Koji Igarashi (Castlevania), Michael Ancel (Rayman; Beyond Good and Evil; King Kong), Takao Miyoki (Phantasy Star Universe), and Masato Maegawa (CEO of Treasure)? Simply incredible. Not to mention their brilliant cover story of Shadow of the Colossus with interviews of the developers.I cannot say enough how good this magazine is. If I could use my years of knowing gaming mags, to sum up what the magazine is like, I would say it's like a cross between the now gone Next Generation, and GameFan with its anime section--but very much with a mind of its own. (For those worried about the anime section, it's located at the back, so you won't miss out on anything gaming related if you choose to skip over it.) I seriously implore you to give it a chance, even if you are a fan of other magazines. Go to your local bookstore and look through it, you don't have to purchase it, just see for yourself. Hopefully, you'll experience the true difference that is Play 
It did take a little while to get to me, but still happy with the experience 
Harper's always takes chances to get noticed. This can be good or bad depending on your tolerance for shock factor i.e. Britney Spears naked, pregnant and with black hair. It's worth a salon read 
... in the U.S. is Harper's Bazaar. You need only check out the recent covers in black and white, featuring Charlize Theron and Demi Moore, to see why this mouthwatering magazine is the high water mark for the best of the best of what's on offer at the supermarket check out stands stateside. In a market crowded with magazines which look increasingly the same and seem to recycle the identical set of celebrity photos over and over again (snooze), Bazaar has cast an eye on the illustrious typography and design sense of its own past years. The results are evident on every glossy page, with very little of the guilty aftertaste here that you'll surely feel after flipping through the advertising book that is any issue of its bloated, mainstream market competitors. Are the clothes ridiculously expensive for all but the richest among us? Of course. Do we really care about who showed up at what swanky party in NYC? Probably not. Will we ever look like any of those models? Darlin', you jest! But we do care (admit it) about the fantasy, the luxe, the allure of beautiful clothes on beautiful people -- they're lovely to behold, it's only natural, and it's fun -- you could do a lot worse than dropping a few bucks on this class act and its peer in the "shelter" magazines group, House and Garden. Another magazine not overstuffed with ads and perfumes and heavy on design sophistication, also highly recommended. I'm sure she's a perfectly lovely person, but I have to say that the recent spread featuring the Duchess of Cornwall (that'd be Prince Chuck's new wife, Camilla) sitting at her vanity with an iPod in her ear was somewhat less than captivating ... unless you count all of the delicious little Corgis showing off at her feet (and I do) ... I don't understand how this got in, but sometimes these things are random, and she is after all the royal consort. Ho hum. Just a blip on the Bazaar radar. Excepting things like that, way to go, Bazaar! Show them how it's done! 
When funds were tight I had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep. Each women's magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing, though with increased competition, these styles seem to be in flux. I finally decided that I preferred the writing in Bazaar and was getting tired of what I felt was Vogue's Cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership (if I want to subscribe to Cosmo, I'll bloody well subscribe). The featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in Vogue. It's a bit snottier (though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions). Among my complaints: Bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine, and while most of Vogue's content is adverts, it does seem to have more articles. Another item that I find highly irritating, is Bazaar's society items. I really don't give a ---- who is wearing what at what charity gala, especially when I don't play footsies with these people. Those complaints aside, this is still my favorite fashion magazine 
As a subscriber to Newsweek for the last 2 years, I'm happy to endorse it. The topics covered which interest me the most involve national/world politics and science; however, I'm pleased to discover other subjects covered that I wouldn't typically seek out(entertainment, religion, etc.). I'm puzzled by the ranting of other negative reviews. While it's not perfect, I consider Newsweek to be solid overall in its coverage and general interest 
i love newsweek. its the perfect mix of important news and interesting stories. articals arent too long, i like the frequent sidebars that help to break down the information. great value. 
Newsweek is an easy to read and interesting magazine. However, it is not as balanced as the Economist or Time Magazine but does come up with some interesting articles on developments worldwide. If you ignore the conservative slant of the magazine, you can enjoy the coverage and analysis of various current world events. Newsweek helps me to keep up with developments in a diverse range of subjects including business and society, international affairs, politics, arts and other areas. I also appreciate its compact yet comprehensive nature. The magazine helps put news into context. For instance, I was often frustrated during the recent Israeli-Hezbollah conflict in Lebanon as I could see the news on TV but did not understand the story behind the news. However, after I read about the conflict in Newsweek, I got to know the background going back into decades and I could now appreciate all the news stories in their proper context. 
This was my weekly newsmag when I was a student and starving artist. Itï¿½s a budget priced version of Time. As I got older and more established financially, I found that I wanted the same from my main weekly news and pop-culture sourcebook, so I switched to time. The information is not much different. It's kinda like Hertz and Avis. Now that I can afford it, I just prefer to be with #1 instead of #2 
I just recently decided to subscribe to this mag. and that was only based on the low price. But it has really suprised me and I totally enjoy this magazine. It is definately my new favorite. Its got a lot of informative articles, unless other mags of its kind that don't have much reading in them 
Great articles on women's health issues. Very up-to-date and helpful information. Easy to follow workout programs. This magazine is exactly what I've been looking for 
Yes, EW has changed over the years, but I believe it's as relevent now as it's ever been. The articles are interesting and the reviews usually right on the mark. I read it cover to cover. 
Bride's magazine is probably the best, but Modern Bride runs a close second and is more in line with the average bride of today who isn't going to have anything close to one of those "average cost of $25 grand" weddings. Of course the gowns are showcased, but MB gives priceless information on honeymoon planning, registering, wedding etiquette, even buying and setting up your first home. The subscriber gets more than their money's worth. Highly recommend 
Photo Techniques Magazine can help serious photgraphers hone their craft, with extensive tutorials on shooting, printing, Photoshop, scanning, and other topics. It's invaluable for both film and digital photographers. Film photographers will treasure this publication because it's one of the few that still provides tips on traditional film photography and darkroom work, even with medium format and large format cameras. Where else will you find artciles about toning? This publication deserves your support. Once it's gone, it's unlikely we'll see anything like it again 
This is the best photo mag for those of us passionate about photography. It has long in debth articles on technique and equipment. Moreover it features "how to" examples from some of the best fine art photographers of our time. It is thus quite different from other magazines that feature some no name staff writer pretending to be Paul Strand. This does make this magazine perhaps less than ideal for the first time casual shutterbug trying out his/her first pocketcam. But for all of us striving to do good photography this magazine has no peer. It is not a glossy magazine and its print quality is rather low. It is a far cry from Phototechnik International or Spoon, but it is about the creating of rather then the displaying of photographs. Having read every photomagazine in the english and german speaking worlds in the last 15 years this is the best 
The review of new photo products are excellent. Well written in my opinion. Highly recommend this magazine 
Time Out New York is a trendy, hip, and fun weekly guide to New York City. It covers weekly events and reviews for just about everything including; eating out, parks, dance, theatre, bars clubs, sales store openings, museums, art, Gay Lesbian, book readings, live music, and much more. The magazine also features interesting facts, profiles, interviews in each weekly issue. I think its great whether you are new to the city or a veteran. This is the PERFECT GIFT for any recent graduates moving to NYC 
I bought it as a gift. The person I got it for, likes it 
I first learned about Time Out while living in London. The London edition of this magazine became my constant companion, allowing me to find great events. Now living just outside of NYC, TONY was my first magazine subscription at my new apartment. Offers many free events, as well as its usual picky reviews. Great for a one-resource list of the week's events 
Time Out New York, or TONY, has it all. Every little thing that's going down in New York is covered. More importantly, you can actually locate salient information without having to wade through 20 pages of transgender massage ads as in the Village Voice 
He was very happy with the product and I was happy as to how fast he has received his product. 
I LOVE NAKED WOMEN BESIDES MY SON BEING BORN; SEEING A NAKED GIRL IN PERSON FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS 13 WAS THE GREATEST DAY IN THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE... thank you and have a nice da 
Young naked women: that's what life is all about. But you have to earn the naked part. Until then, by all means get a subscription to FHM. Unbelievable. And if you cannot actually have the women in the magazine, enjoy the articles. Or try getting famous or something. (Russell David Harper would recommend trying to go to the moon if you can, so that you can talk about your experiences, to women, when you get back [see his silly but perfectly honest novel called "Bald"]. Good news: according to George Bush, we may well be going back to the moon, so sign up now . . . 
So let's do it---let's get a subscription to FHM Magazine, standing for "For Him", I think. But who really cares? Do you? I thought not. The point is: Life is Suffering. Life is Agony, Pain, Humiliation. The Buddha proved it, thousdands of years ago, sitting beneath his Bodhi Tree. All parties, however amusing, however crazed, must End. Love must die. The big football game on Sunday will end---has, in fact, ended, brutally, even as I type these ephemeral words, like black petals dropping from a birch tree. Hell, the Superbowl this year was in Detroit---that fact alone may very well have killed Hunter S. Thompson. Anyway, the fact is: Life is Cold, Brutal, full of Nasty Surprises. Full of a great deal of delicious treats, too, especially if you know where to eat and can get a good table---but as Jim Morrison pointed out, no one here gets out alive. So bedeviled, Gentle Reader, as you must be by the Terrors of our Age: Jihadists commandeering 747s into skyscrapers, the never-ending War in Iraq, political bickering by the simpletons who pretend to run the country while the rest of us work, fires, earthquakes, thunderbolts and floods and lightning, oh my!---perhaps you'll take this simple bit of instruction to heart. You walk into the bookstore of your choice. You're going to pick up the Financial Times, mebbe, or the Economist, and perhaps a book on leadership. Or managing teams. Or mortgage-backed securities, whatever. And you gaze at the magazine rack, and your eyes light on FHM Magazine, front and center. Or rather, on the kneeling, buxom, oiled-up beauty gazing back at you from the cover. Buy it. Better yet, *subscribe*. Isn't that better than worrying over the horrors of the World, at least for a few idle minutes? Yes? The Buddha would subscribe to FHM. JS 
After seeing the price of a year subscription to this mag i just couldnt pass it up. Thats chump change for the amount of entertainment this will give you in a year and it makes my trips to the porcelein pony that much more enjoyable. The articles are funny, witty, and a blast to read. And the women. My jaw dropped when i saw the shoot of Leann Tweeden in the most recent issue. :o This magazine will make you laugh, cry, and fill you with joy. Every guy 16-30 should have this magazine in his toilet book rack. 
FHM is a Great Mag. I subscribe to this, along with Maxim and Stuff. By far, I prefer FHM the most. This magazine offers, not only eye candy (like the other mags) but unique columns which make it stand out. A way better alternative, is Giant Mag. It's a new guy's magazine, which has interesting articles, music and book reviews, and background information in its articles, along with the standard (eye candy) 
A great magazine for those guys who want to be entertained and look at hot looking women. 
US Weekly used to be a cross between People and The National Enquirer - ever since the new editor has stepped in (it seems that they have a new one every year) the magazine has been revamped. It looks more like the classy People and less like a trash tabloid. I'm also a little skeptical about those who complain Amazon.com doesn't deliver their magazines. Not every business is perfect, but I haven't had a problem having my magazines delivered when I've ordered them from Amazon.com. It just makes me think that all the people that are whining are just taking out their frustrations on life at Amazon.com. Maybe its why we see so many vicious and jealous reviews, if you don't like your life change it. Don't complain about it, that's how most people get where they are today. Anyway, unlike People, US Weekly mainly focuses on celebrities and I think that for its price its far too short. At least People is thick. Anyhow, for the celebrity junkie, US Weekly is a must read. Like another reviewer, I too am tired of reading about Jessica Simpson and Brangelina. I think the celebrity magazines are tired of this as well. I'm starting to see a more diverse focus of celebrities on the magazines. Its certainly much better than reading In touch and Life Style Weekly. Although I do like US Weekly, I still think that People is the best. People is more classy, has a great layout, their focus is 50/50 on celebrities and articles on average folks. They have great photos and other interesting reads on their magazine. Even their website is great, US Weekly's website looks like a barbie website. The recent changes have been great but if US Weekly really wants to compete with People then it needs to step up to the plate more. Despite its faults, US Weekly is a luscious read and worth all of its frothiness, so enjoy it. 
I enjoy your magazine and found the Manhattan apartment beautiful. However, is there a logical reason for the zip lock bag on the coffee table (pg.45). Over looked??? Dog biscuits?? I don't think these were available for life at versailles. THIS IS NOT A COMPLAINT. COULD NOT HELP BUT LAUGH. HOPE YOU THINK IT IS AS FUNNY AS I DID. 
Yeah, In Touch magazine is basically fluff when compared to world events, but I like their kind of fluff. This class of magazine is celebrity driven without being what I would classify a tabloid (i.e. Star or The National Inquirer). In comparison, In Touch magazine most closely relates to US Weekly and People. Of these three magazines, In Touch has the best quality and quantity of photographs. In Touch's article's aren't as good as US Weekly's, but with a much lower cover price it's worth picking up one when in line at the grocery store. On the other hand, if you are looking to subscribe to a weekly magazine, US Weekly is a better bet because their usual subscription price is $.1.00 per issue versus their $3.50 cover price per issue. Meanwhile, In Touch does not give much of a price break for subscribers. Their subscription price is $.1.49 per issue versus their $1.99 cover price per issue 
(...) Other magazines that write about similar topics are outrageously priced and their articles are misleading and you never learn anything of actual relevance to the topics on the cover. One prime example of this is US Weekly. I have read several issues of this in the past usually by way of someone giving the mag to me when they were done with it and I've actually only personally bought US Weekly twice. But it's style annoys me and it is a magazine that wants to write about interesting celebrity driven issues but often fails. Please do not confuse In Touch with US Weekly. That is what I sometimes think that other people might easily dismiss In Touch as being like US especially since they sometimes feature the same celebs and are right next to each other on newstands. In Touch keeps you "in touch" with celebrities and their important/interesting stories happening week to week with their lives. But you don't feel like a stalker or something reading this magazine as I have read other people comment on US. In Touch always stays a safe distance from celebs personal lives and do not cross the line with their articles and no matter who or what article is being written In Touch keeps up a respectful and tasteful point of view about the subject/celebrity at hand. And they also talk about important things in the public eye, such as in this weeks issue these are a few of the stories: In the People in the News section: Cynthia Nixon's brand new life - this article is talking about how Cynthia has now found love and happiness in her life and her lover is a woman. I had no clue about this till reading the article. The article just tells the straight up facts, a quote from one of Cynthia's friends saying "She is totally in love and has nothing to hide. She has two beautiful kids, money in the bank, an incredible career, an Emmy for that career, and now a girlfriend. So for Cynthia, life couldn't be better and she wants to share her happiness with the world!", and nothing bad is said in the article.. as you can tell, quite the opposite. This is the way In Touch handles itself - it tells the facts and is more about happy things in celebs lives and less about the worse. But what I meant before is it talks about even no celeb issues as in this next story in People in the News: *under the Survivors heading* Montana Plane Crash Miracle - about a man and woman that were at first presumed dead in a plane crash, but the woman, Jodee Hogg managed to free herself from the plane's wreckage and then free fellow parks co-work Matthew Ramige. They stayed with anthor fellow passanger while he died and then left to get help and walked two and a half miles - and Matthew had a broken back and burns. It's really amazing. Kelly Ripa's advice for working moms Is Joaquin still mourning his brother? Prince Harry Gets Serious Mary Kay defends her Crime There is a cover story about J.Lo and Jennifer Garner and what J.Lo thinks about "Bennifer 2" and is she still in love with Ben. But even that is handled respectfully and the closest thing that it gets to sensationalizing it is a page entitled Battle of the Jens but it is more in fun than anything and that is plainly obvious. Here is a few more headings of articles within the mag - I think they are pretty self explanatory so I'm just going to list them: Can You Be Friends with Your Lover's Ex? - Three's not a crowd for Renee, Jack and his former wife, Meg. Fashion Trauma - Even Celebs Strike Out, But Can These Oops Outfits Be Saved? Why Chip and Kim Had to Win $1 Million At Home with Kelly Osbourne - Her Pink Paradise Jerry's Favorite Food Stop - Crossing Jordan star Jerry O'Connel takes In Touch to Carney's in LA The 10 Sexiest Men of the Season - It's raining men this autumn, with Hollywood hunks strutting their stuff all over the big and small screens. What makes them the best? She's a Plus-Size Model and Proud! - America's Next Top Model Toccara is happy just the way she is. Fatherhood Changed My Life! - Mark Wahlberg talks about his journey from crotch grabbing bad boy to devoted dad Is Tyra the next Oprah? And several more. I especially like the section: Is It True? - The Real Story Behind the Hottest Gossip. You can read this and know that what is being told is the truth. I have noticed that way more celebrities open up and allow In Touch to have interviews and tell them the first hand facts than *other* magazines. Also featured in this issue is an article on Kevin Costner's wedding and the reception to be fair last weeks focused more on his wedding and this one more the reception. And it featured different pics/angles than last week's so it was not recycled material. Is Katie's Wedding Dream Finally Coming True? - Now that her boyfriend's divorce is final, America's favorite sweetheart is free to tie the knot and she couldn't be happier! (talking about Katie Couric if you didn't know) Nicole (Kidman) - Pretty in Pink - a look at Nicole in a chic pink outfit and how to copy it for less. The shirt and skirt they pick and the accessories are quite cute and all together cost 240 dollars which is really not bad, especially considering that is shirt, skirt, ring, and shoes total. The average well to do person could afford that if they wanted to. And in every issue is: The Stars Above - Horoscope Time to Relax - Crossword Puzzle Best of the Week - new movies at the theater, on dvd, music and tv Last Words - random funny celeb quotes I've said a pretty good bit about this mag but just because I really do like it a lot and think there is pretty much something for everyone interest wise. Yes it is celeb orientated but the articles as you can see are of wide ranges of interest and topics to do with the celeb world and also non celeb world. I think they definitely want to appeal to a broader audience than US Weekly. I always look forward to buying this magazine and learning the new info on my favorite celebs and sometimes non favorite celebs because the articles are so interesting. I will admit that other reviewers have put me off of subscribing to the magazine because of the poor service of arrival of the magazine in that means. So for now I'll just stick to the newstands especially seeing as how my Allure and Glamour are both late this month but that is an entirely different issue.. But to sum this up In Touch is the perfect price. I mean the only thing better would be if they went down to 99 cents an issue. lol The articles are interesting and well informed and the editiors and journalists seem to have a respect and caring for their subject matter that other magazines in this field. If you see In Touch on the newstands buy it once and just take it home and read it cover to cover and see if you like it. I'm willing to wager that you will. 
I absolutely love this magazine. I find amazing things I never new off and especially the new inventing are very interesting 
This is a great magazine for those who are curious. Every month is packed with a wide range of interesting articles on diverse scientific subjects. A lot of fun, and very stimulating 
Popular Science is a great magazine. I love to look at the new stuff coming out. The amount Tof ads inside is the only downside to this magazine. Almost half the magazine is fullpage ads 
This one of the best magazine ever for science and new things, from car to everything. Amazon is usually cheaper on magazines than anyone else and no hassell about calling all the time trying to sell you something. buy this mag. you will like it 
This is a very nice magazine for those who like to stay up on current and possible future technologies! I love to read the articles about technologies that may come in the future or that are in the design and research process 
Okay, I've read the other reviews that call this publication shallow, lacking in depth, geared toward young teenagers, etc. I guess if you are looking for twenty page, in-depth technical articles that delve into every minute neutron of a particular subject, then yes, this publication might not be what you're looking for. But, if you're a regular, average, ordinary guy like me (who would not understand those deep, brainy articles anyway) and you are looking for an entertaining, informative view onto what's new and what's cool, I think you'll be pleased. Very pleased! Take, for example, a couple of recent issues (see the date of when this review was written). Last month was focused on the future of personal aviation and the people behind the effort to make personal flight more available and affordable, and about the aircrafts they are inventing. Fascinating! Now, can I run out and build myself a prototype after reading the articles? Ummm, no. Do I know a whole lot more about an incredibly fun subject then I did before? Yes! This month's issue focuses on similar theme: The future of personal space travel and the idea of a space-hotel. When you're done reading it will you be able to build a rocket and fly to the moon? Of course not. But it's informative and educational to the exact level I would want it to be... just enough to make me aware, enlightened, and entertained. So to all the non-nerds, non-rocket scientists, and non-brainiacs who want a scientific publication by the people, for the people, I think your yearly subscription money will be well spent. Enjoy 
This is a conservative magazine from the perspective of protestism, catholicism, and eastern orthodoxy. The perspective is based on the Bible and Early Church Councils. This is a good magazine, I recommend it 
As an owner of a wonderful loving pit bull dog, I adore this magazine because every issue there are pit bull faces smiling at me. I love the insightful articles, the wonderful vendors. I love this magazine! Thank you for all you do 
I like that The Bark ISN'T a monthly magazine. I usually get sick of a magazine after a while. When another one comes, reading it just seems like something to add to my "to-do" list. But I'm always happy to see the beautifully photographed cover of The Bark when it arrives. I've subscribed for several years and have seen it go from something that could barely be called a magazine to its current slick and fabulous format. 
I've received and read one issue of The Bark so far. I am amazed at the great pictures of dogs (posed and in action). It's a fun magazine to relax with and enjoy. The articles are well written, and very interesting. I'm glad that I treated myself to this subscription. Usually, I stick with Dog Fancy, The Whole Dog Journal, Your Dog, and Dog World, as they serve the very necessary topics of wellness, what to do/not do, meeting the breed, and much more. The Bark is intelligent and modern 
Seriously, I perused the Summer 05 issue in a reading/tv area of a large corporation and was tempted to take it home. It was outstanding. I will subscribe 
This is an extremely "well rounded" magazine! I thoroughly enjoy every issue. Bark covers all issues concerning dogs. From articles on veterinary issues, understanding your dogs behaviour, dog gear....and outstanding well written short stories and articles written by people about their dogs and how they have impacted their lives. Very enjoyable reading....from cover to cover. I highly recommend Bark. If you get your "paws" on your first copy, you will definitely look forward to the next 
Every issue is so exciting you'll look forward to buy/receive them in your mailbox every 2 months!beautiful pictures,neat ads and so many articles(some really touching!).they focuses probably more on real life heroes rather than celebrities which makes them unique 
I am a new subscriber, have received two issues so far. This is a fascinating magazine, beautifully laid out, and well written. In the first issue I received (which I have now read almost cover-to-cover, something I Never do with magazines), there were articles about Dog rescue in Asia, the science of the historical relationship between Dogs and their humans, emotional vignettes about the love between Dogs and humans and so much more. I like the reviewer who likened this magazine to the New Yorker about Dogs. The first issue was chock-full of everything from useful tips to weepy stories to fascinating science. I made an effort to cancel all of my magazine subscriptions recently, simply because I do not have the time to read them all. This one will remain. In fact, I may start archiving this magazine-it is that good! All of our guests inevitable pick up the magazine, drawn by the crisp graphics, and retained by a healthy variety of reading. Obviously, I am a fan. I have barely started the second issue, but from skimming the articles, I have full faith that I will not be disappointed. Subscribe and enjoy 
This magazine is packed with great articles. It's one of the only magazines I read from cover to cover. A MUST for any dog lover. A perfect gift for a dog lover. 
What I love most about this travel magazine is the out-of-the-ordinary information it provides within a particular destination. Although primarily geared towards $$$$$+ destinations, the editors do a great job with providing more than just great hotel info. In the September 2006 edition, there is the 12 th annual Green List which details the best places in ecotourism - preserving earth's environment and cultures while traveling to the destinations that are simultaneously earth and people friendly. It happens to be a great magazine, well researched, well written, and informative while delivering unique information. 
I used to love this magazine. It still has some excellent articles, but it is true that there are way too many filler issues now with top 100 lists of things I have no interest in (resort hotels, spas, expensive travel agents). However, on the flip side, it never talks down to the reader - the audience is assumed to be well travelled and somewhat sophisticated - which I appreciate. I checked out Nat Geographic Traveller hoping it would be like the CN Traveller of old, but although it has nicer photography (with few gratuitously scantily clad female shots), it seemed much more mainstream - like I had already done many of the "dream trips" befor I hit my 30s and the information also seemed much shallower. I like Geo, but I struggle through the French and it's a lot more expensive 
Blender's a fun magazine that I enjoy reading for the articles and reviews. It covers a variety of artists and there's never a dull page. I especially like "20 Songs You Should Download This Month." I could however, do without all the half naked girls that are usually a part of every issue. Is this FHM or a music magazine? Still, the other contents of the magazine more than make up for it. The magazine's hip layout and quirkiness (the occasional song lyric next to a page number, or "Word" which features a small pic of an artist and a quote) are a refreshing way to showcase music. I find it to be comparable to the UK music magazines that I've preferred over the years. Plus, Blender's cover price is only a fraction of most of UK music magazines and when you subscribe, its even less 
It is a good magazine. Although, it showcases the same musicians on the cover. It showcases bands like Fallou Boy on the cover more like XXL does with G-Unit. The features are pretty good. I like Ask a Superstar, that is probably one of the best of them. Also, their reviews, I agree with them sometimes, and other times, they give way too low ratings. Also, I have had the subscription for a while now and the magazine never fails to entertian me when it comes to Music. I also like the half naked girls. Don't we all? Give a chance when you can. 
1) A "Why Not?" page toward the beginning of the magazine, with short blurbs on useful things to do. An example: Where to recycle corks from wine bottles. Another example: How to turn dead leaves on your lawn into mulch to fertilize your yard, rather than bagging up the leaves. 2) Lots of recipes and cooking tips (The current issue includes vegetarian dishes.) 3) Reader's tips on a "question of the month." Example: "How do you save money during the holidays?" One winner each month receives a prize. 4) A Solutions section, including "New Uses for Old Things." For each item, the original purpose is described along with an "Aha! Use." 5) A section on organizing. 6) "Road Tests." Four items are featured, with comparisons in each category. This month: winter gloves, food processors, cleansing cloths, and vanilla ice cream. Even if you are not shopping for these items now, the info is useful for later. Two years ago, I bought an extremely reasonably priced set of durable everyday glassware based on their recommendation, and I have been very pleased with the glasses. 7) "Life Lessons." Personal, reflective essays that are very thoughtful and ispiring. 8) Home (including decorating), beauty, style, and body (health) sections. I discovered a great website for world art (supported by National Geographic, not of the commercialized Pier One variety), thanks to them. 9) A "Life" section that includes tips on how to navigate conflicts and difficult situations. 10) This month: A wonderful article on creative ways to preserve your family history. I loved the ideas and loved reading about the contributors' families--absolutely fascinating. 11) Lots of tips on saving money, time, and energy. Many of their tips do not involve trips to the store (or online shopping, for that matter). 12) A cardstock pull-out reference page in the back, with perforated edges to make small cards that you can carry in your wallet. There is always an inspirational quote (this month's is by P.G. Wodehouse) that you can use as a bookmark. Speaking of quotes, there is always a great quote near the front of the magazine and another on the spine of the cover. Yes, there is a target demographic for this magazine. I am not sure whether I would actually fit Time, Inc.'s target demographic--I am a single graduate student, living in a small apartment--but I always learn a lot from each issue. Not every article appeals to me equally, but that is always the case with a magazine. I save the best articles and file them by topic in a binder, along with articles from Vegetarian Times (the only other magazine to which I subscribe) and Runner's World (a friend gives me her old magazines). The hefty amount of advertising is annoying, but this is the result of the consolidation of the magazine publication world. Time, Inc., also publishes In Style, Essence, and many other magazines. If you want a non-glitzy, anti-establishment magazine, read something like B*tch (yes, it is an actual magazine, although I censored the title for this review, and I love it--will probably subscribe one of these days). But if you are just looking for ways to make your life a little easier, order Real Simple. It's not going to teach you how to give up all of your earthly possessions and move to a Peruvian village where you can start your own subsistence farm and weave your fabric from a loom, but it will give you tips on how to make your day-to-day life simpler right where you are. Oh, and Real Simple is branching out: a great website, three published books (on organizing, tips, and cooking), and a show on PBS. No, not TLC or HGTV, but free television for everyone. Kind of populist for an entity of Time, Inc., isn't it 
I just wanted to comment on some of the other reviews that are posted here. Many try to sterotype the type of readers who like Real Simple, well I love this magazine- and didn't manage to fit into any of there categories. My aunt sent me this magazine and then I began to read it monthly, I enjoy the tips and sections like "No time to clean?, quick solutions for every room"- yes they do have product suggestions, but much of the information that is provided can be done with things you already have. Others have called this magazine- " a slave to fashion", as a woman in her 20's I would say this magazine is the one that contains minimal clothing information. Overall I enjoy this magazine, as others have mentioned the recipes are great and I always find plenty of good tips. The photography and layout are amazing, I always use the old editions for reference or crafts 
My mother bought me a gift subscription when I moved in to my first apartment. I love this magazine. I pass the recipies on to family and friends, who have enjoyed them as well. The simple solutions to everyday needs are extremely helpful and well worth the $30 or so for a subscription. I am buying it for a housewarming present for a friend this week. 
I've been a reader since day one and the magazine is filled with time saving tips on cooking, space saving ideas and ideas and even wardrobe tips. For $5 Real Simple offers great tips and Real Simple is geared towards real people with real lives and not the New York loft crowd or mid-west country living crowd...not to be stereotypical but that's how most magazines are geared one coast of the other. Real simple is a great magazine and it continues to be number one in my book. 
We have previously viewed this outstanding magazine and decided to purchase it as a gift for our son. We are disappointed that, although we purchased it in February, he will have to wait until May or June to receive his first copy. We hoped that he would receive the winter issue since it was already in publication. We know he will enjoy the publication but it is hard to encourage that excitement when there is nothing available to show him since we could not find an issue to give him, only a note to explain the coming issues. 
Too many Christians are ignorant of our rich past. We know a lot about the 1st Century and the current times, but everything in between is somewhat blank. Christian History magazine is more than informative; it inspires, challenges and even admonishes in its unique way. I look forward to each issue. I doubt I will ever let this expire 
This is a good place to get idea's for small businesses. I like to get idea's from people who have thought of it and the business works. But be more careful cause i think some of them only works for certain cases only. Try taking a look at this magazine and be your own judge on the quality of this magazine 
My husband got this magazine in hopes of finding ideas for starting a home based business. He admits, that he is jealous that I work from home and get to spend so much time with the kids. As a work at home expert, (I am founder of WebMomz.com and have written a book on the subject) I QUITE familiar with the subject matter. THESE GUYS HAVE DONE THEIR HOMEWORK! There is a wealth of information in here. They offer both entreprenuer type businesses AND "franchise" type ideas for the "not-so-creative" home biz wanna-be. I found myself bookmarking pages left and right. I have read some others that are all MLM hype - no thank you. Small Biz Opportunities is the REAL THING with REAL opportunities. Overall an Excellent Magazine 
Even though there seem to be hundreds of different digital photography magazines on the newsstand every month, Digital Photo Pro is pretty much the only one that I buy. I don't buy every issue, but seeing as I end up buying about 80% of the issues, I should probably get a subscription! I like Digital Photo Pro because it actually contains new and useful information. "New" because it's information that I haven't read in another magazine or on the web, and "useful" because the information is targeted at readers with a solid understanding of the basics of digital photography. I find that most other digital photography magazines are targeted at newbies, and they take turns repeating the same information (like the endless articles about the different ways to convert a colour image to black white). Many of the contributors to Digital Photo Pro are well-known names in the digital imaging field, so the information is generally current and practical, with excellent photos to illustrate the articles. Recommended 
Ok magazine....the problem.....we have NOT received one copy. Can you please help with this??????????????????? 
I've been a subscriber to REVOLVER for over three years now and I must say that they are the best "bang for your buck" music mag there is, period! They pretty much cover all the bases of heavy music (Extreme, Doom, Death, Grind, Metalcore, Hardcore even punk at times). I'd love to check out other metal mags, well the good ones anyways (BW, Anvil, Terrorizer), Sorry but Hit Parader and Metal Edge are kinda lame, too little too late, but also, I simply don't have the cash for a $100+ subscription, all though you do get free sampler cd's with great bands w/ each mag, REVOLVER bust's you out w/ free mp3's each issue too, so you do get to hear something, even though personally I think they could be a little more cutting edge w/ their mp3 choices as they tend to stay in safe Territory as far as what they push, whereas Terrorizer and BW really give you "Extreme" music to listen to, as well as their reviews (they have gotten a bit better). I am however a little pissed, as well as confused as to why I just renewed my 3 year subscription for $15 and it's only $10 even hear on Amazon... Promo? i guess. Oh well, simply put, this is the mag to get if you enjoy Metal Music magazines. 
here are the great things about this magazine subscription 1. the unbeatable price, metal edge is $36 and it sucks 2. It has very interesting articles, artists tattoos a bunch more 3.Free music downloads!!! Overall this is an awesome magazine, beating metal edge and hit parader into the ground. Unlike the other rock mags here you don't see mainstream bands like slipknot on every other page, it cover the lesser known bands too. The picture and paper quality is excellent. Again SUBSCRIBE NOW!! 
Revolver's competing magazines in the heavy metal magazine world are Hit Parader and Circus. I have bought all three of these magazines several times, and Revolver my final judgement is Revolver is the only magazine that is good enough to subscribe to. The other two I still buy occasionally, but only for wallpaper (I cut out the pictures of bands in the magazines and hang them in my room.) This magazine is, in a way, like a combination of Circus and Blender magazines; it combines the best aspects of both. Revolver still has plenty of great pictures, but it is also much longer and much better written than Circus. It is not quite as long or stuffed full of information as Blender, but make sure you note that Revolver only reports on one genre (heavy metal!) whereas Blender could (theoretically) report on every genre (rap, pop, rock, etc.) Chances are, if a hard rock band (especially a big name hard rock band) is about to or has already released a C.D., Revolver will do a story about it. The stories/reports are very entertaining but they also are informative and sometimes a lesson is learned from them. If it's a cover story, an interview with the band is also included; if it's not a cover story, the writer integrates quotes and answers from the band into the article, anyways (even though it's not a formal interview). Revolver writers frequently go on tour with a band (i.e. Lamb of God). In that case, they take the reader backstage, on the tour bus, and in a concert (with a rundown of the show). When I first started reading this magazine, there was a sexual theme to it. There would be a picture of a "hot babe" in a T-shirt, and one side of the poster would be a woman-usually half-naked-in a sexual pose. In the past year or so, Revolver phased that out (probably to appeal to a broader audience). I sometimes miss the pictures of the "hot babes," but this way there's more room for real heavy metal pictures. Yet, even though sex isn't a theme anymore, Revolver is probably a bit too sophisticated for anyone younger than a teenager. Plus, there are usually profanities (mainly the "f word.") So, I would say this magazine is for ages 13 and up. Monthly articles: -Cover story -3 or 4 other biggish stories - "Fresh Blood" column (where a small biography is given on a band you probably haven't heard of) - Ask Vinnie (an column where readers write questions, and Pantera/Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul gives advice) - Hard rock news and notes - Black and death metal news and notes - "In the studio" (an update on bands currently recording new music) -Free poster (in the middle of the magazine, there's a fold-out poster of one or two bands.) The poster isn't very wide, but it is about two pages long -Free music downloads -"Ink Spot" (a story about a musician's favorite tattoo) -"Favorite sh*t" (an interview with a musician, with questions such as "What's your favorite color?") -Joke from a band (Revolver has just recently started doing this) - Reviews (reviews of C.D.'s, music DVD's, and video games) Pros: --Plenty of good pictures and a free poster --Professionally written with well known writers (yet it is NOT too intelligent for teenagers) --Edited well (I haven't found any mistakes or typos) -The "fresh blood" column usually introduces me to a band I haven't heard of, but I should probably check out --Revolver is accredited and well known enough to be allowed to go on tours with bands and be first for interviews --News columns (on both mainstream and underground metal bands) -The stories are always done with quotes from the band that the report is on --Free music! (Revolver has started doing a page that gives the reader a password, which he/she can then access free music downloads online.) --No stupid questions in interviews (they ask up to date questions, and sometimes-i.e. in the interview with Puddle of Mudd-the writers aren't afraid to ask daring, cutting questions) --The "In the studio" segment is always informative --Helpful, reliable reviews (they don't automatically praise every heavy metal C.D.) Cons: --If you're up to date on your music news web sites, the news columns shouldn't really be anything new to you. --Not all C.D.'s are reviewed (they give a rundown on the C.D. in the article about the band, but C.D.'s from bands that are on the cover of the magazine aren't usually reviewed.) -Concerts aren't reviewed -My biggest gripe is that it's only issued once a month. The bottom line is, if you're a metalhead, this is the best magazine you can get! It is more than well worth the ten dollars you will spend for a years worth of entertainment 
This is one of my favorite magazines. It tells you about shows and new ones, movies, celebreties, and more! It also has some interviews with actors/actresses. It has fun puzzles and comics. I love the Scene but Not Heard comics. They are hilarious! Overall, I would get this magazine if I were you 
My nephew loves this magazine. He watches for it to come in the mail for weeks before it arrives. It encourages reading and relates to a variety of current television and reading materials on his age level. He reads it and rereads it. It includes age appropriate jokes and editorial type information on Nickleodeon characters and the Nickleodeon life 
As a long-time IT professional, I've read InfoWorld, Information Weekly, SysAdmin, Dr Dobbs, etc. etc. In 2006, the only one I read with any regularity is Computerworld. It is relevant, smart, and covers an almost impossible range of topics in a very broad IT world. Of late, they've been doing single-page overviews of new technology (with basic definitions) intended to get you up to speed on a buzzword or technology, and point you in the right direction for more information. They have excellent columnists on the whole (I can do without Curt Monash's DBMS theories) and some amazing reporters. There's hardly a week that doesn't bring me something new to learn or consider. Rounding out its better aspects is the sections closer to the front, containing shorter articles and snippets that often lead to more reading on my part, all good pointers. Finally, there's the Shark Tank, the back page column that lists dumb things in IT (think Dilbert's daily routine). My biggest problem has to do with the Editor-in-Chief. I hardly ever agree with Don Tennant's editorials, and think he's more of a China apologist than anything else. Still, his magazine is a very good one, and worth reading for anyone in the IT industry who needs a really good view of what's going on today. I can tolerate his dumb opinions, so long as the rest of the magazine remains so good. -Fre 
...and while, yes, I've made comments in the past about how Oprah has changed a little, this is about a PUBLICATION. I'm sure that the person who wrote that "this is just another magazine full of things one can't afford" reads fashion or celebrity magazines FULL of MANY things she can't afford. Advertising generates money and, while I don't like ads either, they are everywhere because advertising works. If you don't want to see them, don't buy magazines, watch tv or go anywhere. As far as the layouts being "too full of clutter" ...everyone has their own style. There are some people who like that look and don't prefer a pared-down, zen look. Magazines are not about reality. If they were, they wouldn't be plastered with plastic, bronzed 6' females who weigh 100 lbs. I'm originally from middle America, and nobody looks like THAT there. Just take magazines and ads for what they are. Save your money, like I do, for things you just HAVE to have. If you don't have the perserverence to do that, then stick to the Target and Walmart circulars. The knock-offs are never far behind. 
The Writer is the best of the four magazines on writing I have read over the past couple years. The quality of articles, the focus on the writing craft is superior to others that are available in the market. I look forward to each issue arriving in my mailbox 
"The Writer" is the premier magazine for writers of all varieties. Kalmbach is known for publishing a great series of specialty periodicals, and this one is extremely well written and edited, as is appropriate for the subject matter. The magazine is best for aspiring writers of fiction, with the clear majority of column inches. Poetry is also covered well, and nonfiction (my area of interest), while covered, is definitely in third place. In the end, though, most techniques for fiction also help nonfiction authors and vice-versa: I read every issue cover to cover regardless of area of concentration because I have gleaned some of the best tips from articles that superficially seemed not to pertain to my writing. The magazine is very good at covering new developments in the publishing world, and features in-depth reporting on subjects like "Print on Demand" (POD) publishing. Many articles concentrate on in-depth technique implementation, while the utilitarian short pieces that cut through grammatical tedium and stylistic methodologies reinforce the basics. If you are interested in writing as a professional or just for personal satisfaction, "The Writer" is the magazine for you. 
The Writer is one of my favorite mags, and I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox. It's packed with "how to" articles on fiction writing and poetry. There are also interviews, book reviews, and stuff on literary journals. There are a lot of writing magazines out there, I've subscribed to all of them, but this one is the best. You won't be disappointed. Also recommended: Writer's Digest, The Sun and The Gospel of Arni 
I've been a freelance writer since 1996, and every month I look forward to reading the next issue of The Writer. It's a magazine that shows you how to write better, how to get published, and how to stay inspired. The interviews with top writers are great, and I love the reviews of books about writing. The hour or so I spend reading each issue is among the best time I ever spend. If you're a writer, you should subscribe immediately 
I subscribe to many magazines, but of all the magazines I receive every month, my two favorites are "Dwell" and "Metropolitan Home," which both focus on the contemporary aesthetic in home design, renovation, and decorating. "Metropolitan Home" is my preferred magazine for decorating related tips, while I rely on "Dwell" more for renovation and design ideas. I particularly like the comparative articles, which show how to achieve a specific, expensive, look within the confines of a smaller budget. Make no mistake about it, most of the homes in this magazine are upscale (read "expensive"), but are much more mainstream than the homes featured in more traditional magazines like "Architectural Digest." I also like the attention that "Metropolitan Home" places on details like fixtures and finishes, and I appreciate the balance it strikes between urban and suburban homes. I find "Metropolitan Home" to be an excellent value, and read every issue thoroughly. I am in the midst of some remodeling and home improvements now, and have found many useful tips in this magazine. Anyone who appreciates contemporary architecture or design will appreciate "Metropolitan Home," and as a related aside, I also highly recommend, "Dwell. 
This is simply the best woman's magazine I've ever read! And I can say that I've read a lot of them - both in the US and in Germany. I've read it for over 12 years and I can say that I never got bored with it. I'm still excited about any new issue. The articles always matter and they catch just the right balance between being serious and entertaining. It's for the modern young woman. To name a few subjects: Career, love, sex, family, style, wellness, travel reports and interviews - every article going a bit deeper than the usual woman's magazine. There's really something to read for days. And on a side not: There's more articles than ads! 
it's a great way to keep in touch with the culture, language and general issues that affect women in German 
I've been buying this magazine since it first came out. I let my subscription lapse for a few months and sure missed getting People in the mail on Fridays. It's back and I'm glad! 
People is the most incredible magazine. The writers of the magazine know exactly what you want to read as a subscriber, but there will always be an extra section that just does not interest you because no magazine can attract every ones personal interests. No matter what this magazine always makes Friday a great day. I feel the best part about People magazine is the fact that they give you special issues, like 50 Most Beautiful People, Sexiest Man Alive, and Eligible Bachelor. You get a variety highlights in each People issue. You will find inside each issue many sections pertaining to your interest. A section called the mailbox where you get to read other people responses to the articles in the last issue released. The passage page where they will give you all the details of celebrities such as marriages, births, divorces, deaths, injured, or convicted. Finally, I love getting toward the end of the magazine just to be able to read the true crime stories because they are intriguing and quite interesting. The only bad part about People magazine is that most people, just like myself, buy the issues to read about celebrities. But you also get the human interest stories which don't seem to interest everyone. Now I do not have a subscription, but I read every issue, whether I buy them myself or read the magazine at work. I would say that if you wanted to purchase a magazine this would be a great one to choose because the magazine reaches out to any one in their teenage years and up 
I enjoy reading my People magazine every weekend. After a hard week of "real life", it's nice to read about celebrities and their fancy lives and clothing, and also about some of the normal people that have done something extraordinary. People is feel-good reading, but it's a nice break from some of the violent news and depressing economic stories we hear every day. 
SPIN covers pretty much every type of rock music out there...like electronic, altevernative, metal, EVERYTHING. They don't sugarcoat anything, and it's really funny at times. Definetly 5 stars 
I know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but I do appreciate the information that I've gained from store bought "Maximum PC" magazines. I don't build computers but when I do order one, it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer. Yes... you can find much information on-line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox, however, is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read' about it :) A very good magazine... but 'adult' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language. Thus the 4 rather than five stars 
This magazine is very good for the novice to medium level computer user. Recommended for sure 
A fun read encompassing nearly every important facet of the PC with an emphasis on performance and gaming. Yes the information they provide can be found on the internet, but the simplicity and no-nonsense approach of their reviews makes getting the information a pleasure rather than an arduous task leading to more questions than answers 
The best magazine available for PC enthusiasts, very good info on overclocking, system optimizing, OS tweaks and excellent hardware and software reviews, I look forward to each issue 
This is by far the best PC magazine I have ever owned. It provides great reviews of the latest products out on the market. Before building your PC make sure you check this magazine first. I love the layout and the great looking design. I highly recommend this magazine 
When it comes to music, culture, and overall coverage of meaningful entertainment, Paste is where it's at. Fairly a new publication (starting in July of 2002), the magazine has soared in popularity and holds its own in a marketplace saturated with bland and repetitive articles. If you're sick of reading magazines that only focus on mainstream trends, surface culture, and the next teenage sensation, then this is your magazine. The publication focuses on a wide array of music, but emphasizes the folk, indie-rock, and alternative genres. In its pages you'll find very useful album reviews, articles on an array of films (especially indie ones, which are hard to come by these days), as well as book suggestions. But by far the best part of the magazine is that every issue includes a Sampler CD, which can include anything from short films, new music, and/or documentaries. Paste prides itself on catering to its consumer and is the perfect reading material for anyone who still enjoys stumbling onto new music, learning and growing in their song crafting, and keeping up with good quality... not quantity. The magazine blatantly states that it looks for "signs of life in music, film, culture..." and if you find yourself looking for the same, then you'll definitely find satisfaction with Paste magazine. Never a bland issue. Never gets old. Always interesting 
PASTE magazine was made just for me! I don't even know how it came to be...I had started to receive the now-defunct TRACKS magazine (unsolicited - - probably a last-ditch effort to build a subscriber base) and when they finally went under, I was credited with two issues of PASTE. WOW! This magazine is utterly awesome! Besides the cd (or dvd - - or sometimes both!), the music, the films, the cultural issues are all enlightening and well-written. It is obviously a labor of love for all those involved in its creation. It is literally chock-full of interesting stuff, particularly not-necessarily-mainstream stuff. In all honesty, I find the advertisements particularly helpful in turning me on to new great artists, which I probably would not have heard of otherwise. I also appreciate the thicker-than-average cover, since I tend to carry it around with me for a while, to devour it by bits and pieces in every spare moment. Each issue ends up plastered with sticky-note reminders to check out or follow-up on something or other, and I've even resorted to folding over pages of interesting articles for later reference. The magazine holds up very well to my attentive abuse. So, if you are ready to escape the pablum that the entertainment industry has been spoon-feeding you for so very long, be sure to check out PASTE. Support real artists, you won't be disappointed 
Absolutely love this magazine. So much, I gave it as gifts to my family. Perfect for music fans tired of the same old Top 40 radio and craving for some fresh new sounds. Each isssue even comes with a compilation CD and DVD of movie shorts, videos, etc. Sometimes I feel this was created just for me 
Although it has a lot of advertising, it is an informative magazine and gives helpful info about decorating in the country style 
Even when I lived in the city - yearning to be in the country - I loved this magazine! As a matter of fact I just picked up 12 year old copies at a yard sale this summer and the articles, recipes and tips are just as valuable today as they were back then! While other magazines get leafed through from friends and visitors to our home, Country Living always seems to get well worn, well actually devoured is likely a better word! Even my 12 year old reads it 
I have been listening to christian metal since the early days. Back when all there was to listen to was Stryper and a few others. Since there was no internet back then we needed HM to bring the info to us. If it wasn't for Doug Van Pelt the faithful would have been lost. I remember waiting on the edge of my seat for the next issue to come. If you listen to christian music, get this mag. It's the bible of christian metal!! 
Whether you are into hard music or not, whether you are a Christian or not, there is plenty of good stuff carefully invested in each page of HM magazine. The news keeps you on your toes with pointers that you actually care about. There is a notably diverse range of music covered, with a special emphasis on hard music and indie music-- "Christian" bands, mind you (whatever that means now days...) Interviews are anything but standard, and far from dull. Reviews are constructive, insightful and informative... very useful for selecting cds. There are helpful tips for guitarists and drummers, and they review gear too. For those of us who are Christian (yes I am one,) there is some great down to earth advice in the last columns on all things relevant. However, one must be interested in at least one of these two things: 1. Good music 2. Christianity. Otherwise, this zine is probably not for you. Anyhow, find out for yourself 
While many mainstream publications have been shying away from calling members of the current American government into account for their transgressions - from bribery and theft to misinformation and cover-ups of sexual escapades - "The Nation" has done its job and reported the facts. For its trouble, many of those who lean the same way as the current administration lambast the magazine as "too liberal" and "naively progressive." So let's put it this way: If you value truth over lies and think the rights of "the little guy" are just as important as the rights of fat cats, you will like "The Nation." But be warned -- "The Nation" is rife with page after thorough page of intense reporters' writings, and even some clever poetry, but only rarely has pictures. Which may be the real reason why right wingers don't like it 
"Time" is a fascinating magazine to read. It provides insightful and enlightening news most of the time. The magazine provides more balanced reporting than say Newsweek. I find its coverage of the wide range of issues it covers including politics, the arts, business and lifestyle, and many other areas to be interesting and enlightening. So for those looking for a weekly that is largely educative on developments worldwide, then Time Magazine should do. To those already subscribing for the magazine, congratulations for making a good choice. 
This magazine is an easy read that keeps me generally informed with what's going on. Unlike the dry indepth articles of the Economist, Time Magazine is quick bang bang information. -a good overview. 
Five "Big Apple" Stars!! New York magazine is a mind trip to New York City that anyone can take by sitting down for a brisk read of about an hour anywhere in the world. But it'll take much longer to digest the detailed topical sections in the back portion of the magazine. And it covers everything: from a throughly researched, interesting, and eye-catching cover article, to departments that cover movies, the latest Broadway play reviews, the night clubs, and a restaurant and club section 'that goes on and on'. I can literally plan forays into the 'Big Apple' using this magazine, from the latest trendy hotel, the latest 'unique' meal in an established or a new reataurant, the newest On or Off Broadway play, art movie houses showing great independent movies that you probably won't find anywhere else in the US outside of Los Angeles, what artist is appearing at what jazz or rock club and the times of the shows, "cover" or "no cover", etc, etc, etc. And yes, tons of glitzy ads. it's just a "New York state of mind" in a magazine that you can use to plan a physical trip or just mentally take the trip. And it will keep you up to date on the current issues in the City. New York magazine sets the standard for all of those other city and state magazines. I love New York City and I love New York magazine. Five Big Stars! 
Well written, highly informative and with a recent redesign one of the best looking city magazines I've seen. Always interesting lead articles and great food reviews (better than the main competition Time Out). Only real quibbles are that their event listings aren't as comprehensive as Time Out, but there is so much better writing here that it doesn't really compare. 
Love the recipes, love everything inside. I'm a foodie and this magazine is a monthly food for my soul. : 
I love the look of this magazine. -Such high quality. The overwhelming amounts of advertisements can be a bit much though. The photography and style is fantastic. They some how make everything from vases to flowers to all foods look compelling and beautiful 
I'm kind of a homebody -- I love making things, sewing and cooking, and making my home as nice as possible for myself, my kids, and my guests. When I found this magazine, it was love at first sight: crafts, easy sewing projects, home-made decorations and beautifully photographed meals, all in one spectacularly well-put-together magazine. To be honest, I always loved Martha's work but could never stand her show; now I can have all that her show offers (and more) without having to be annoyed by a tv programme. I highly recommend this magazine if what you're looking for is a source of inspiration for home projects, rife with easy -- and mostly quick -- crafts and decorations. I would almost recommend this even if you only buy it for the photographs. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because, as another reviewer mentioned, it is loaded with ads. That's my only complaint 
I've been a subscriber for many years. Martha's magazine is always filled with beautiful images and great-looking recipes. her suggestions for housekeeping, gardening, and decorating are always tasteful and useful. I particularly like her holiday recipe selections. My main complaint about her magazine are the recipes. The food looks great, but the recipes I've made are fairly on the bland side and overcomplicated. I immediately pass over recipes with ingredients I cannot find in the supermarket or recipes which require 7-10 eggs and endless beating. I have come to the conclusion that I prefer recipes which are spicier than Martha does and desserts which are less frou frou. In fact, I prefer her FOOD magazine for recipes. 4 stars. I'm a lifetime subscriber, but I wish the recipes were a little more to my taste. They seem geared more toward goumand foodies than your average joe 
I'm a culinary historian and author (CALIFORNIA PIONEERS, their stories, culture and cuisine)who spends a lot of time delving into the pages of history, especially food history. When I want to give my burned-out peepers a break, I reach for this magazine. As much as I love the food articles -- mostly because, as great as they look, realistically they are quite do-able for just about anyone -- what I really find useful is the "Ask Martha" column in which practical answers are given to problems readers write in about. And then there are the craft projects...I have tried several and was surprised by my success. I credit this to the well laid-out photos and very clear instructions. My advice is, if you are looking for a magazine that touches on every aspect of living and enjoying a well-designed (and I do not mean "haughty") lifetsyle, then you cannot go wrong with Martha Stewart Living. Also, the special holiday ideas are the best ever...makes one wonder, how do they keep coming up with such unique ideas that are do-able for the general population?[... 
This magazine transports you to a different world. Every issue is a wish-book, with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month, or crafts to do over your next long weekend, or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room. Well, in my life, years go by and I dream on. But just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped, negative, angry thoughts. I will never laugh at "crafty" people again. I will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside, but the dreams are sweet. The expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating, but then you have gardening, cooking, baking, furniture, decorating, beading, anything do-it-yourself. Martha is truly a wonder woman. Worth every cent 
Someone posted below that they don't receive all their issues. I have never failed to receive an issue. I suspect someone is making off with this person's copies. This is an elegant magazine, worthy of Martha. If they cover a topic, you will know all there is to know about that topic. The recipes are little gems, and I like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved. It's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world. I do miss Martha's column of reminiscences, and wish that was back in the magazine 
After checking the exorbitant prices of foreign magazines and Billboard Magazine I love my suscription to Rolling Stone Magazine. Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with the good folks that say that too many uneventful acts are being given undue praise. And yes, obviously it is not the same magazine of yesteryears. I do recognize the fact that times are indeed changing all the time and Rolling Stone has changed as well. But seriously folks, where else you are going to find the awesome deal of a Rolling Stone suscription? Talk about affordable to the masses. Yes, I checked the prices for Uncut, Mojo, Melody Maker? (or something like that) and the prices were downright ridiculous. Not everyone has the inclination to dish out $9-$12 dollars for a sucription. Oh yes, the English have the edge, their magazines are sooo vital, no air between the ears type music journalism, more and more accolades for them and abuse and criticism for Rolling Stone. I agree some of their reviews such as James Brown's "Live at the Apollo" making it a 5 star album is just not so and I bought it for the review. All these Hip-Hop taking center stage, all these blank acts that have yet to make their mark, but hey, you know what? It informs you, it lets you know what is going on out there and once in a while some serious journalism is to be enjoyed. All the politics pisses me off but some of the more dark essays sometimes grab my attention, but here is the grabber: For the same price of the ridiculous expensive imported magazines you can buy a lifetime suscription from Rolling Stones! I mean, till the day you cross the treshold and all the earthly subjects will no longer have any bearing in the state of things. If you are 20 that is 40, 50, 60 years of delivery to your door. What does that break down to? Actually and I am no Mathematician but I am sure it breaks down to Zero for an all American Music Magazine. Take your criticism overseas because Rolling Stone is a great buy any way you slice it and you can take that to the bank. Some awesome reporters have graced the covers of this magazine so do not give me any flak and some great articles too! Boo Whoo, Boo Whoo, Rolling Stone is a great buy, now what? 
No other magazine I'm aware of gets more undeserved criticism than RollingStone. The writing is supurb. I don't know why everyone assumes pop culture magazines must all be sensationalist rags in the same vein as Teen Beat. Complaining that too many talentless teen icons are put on the cover is pointless--it is after all a magazine that delves into POP CULTURE. Not liking the subject matter isn't just cause to criticize. The record review section is the best of any music mag. It's 100% idiotic to assume their reviews are bogus just because some band or group that you wouldn't ever consider listening to anyway got a "good" rating. The beauty of their reviews is that they pander neither to music elitists nor so-called "teeny-boppers," and their reviewers are smart enough to be able to differentiate between what makes good pop music and what makes good experimental music. RollingStone is NOT a specialty magazine that's going to say a certain type of music is great and another type is crap. It is just a music and pop culture mag, and a damn good one 
I have just read an interview on 'The American Spectator 'in which the journalist Charley Levine interviews Jonathan Pollard. Polland explains the unusual harshness of his jail sentence, and its injustice. I think it is quite commendable that the 'Spectator' prints such an interview. The Spectator counts among its contributors P.David Hornik one of the finest political writers working today. It has a political line which I generally sympathize with. It is a friend, and even if at times is not at the highest of highest quality it is certainly superior to most of the opposition 
The American Spectator is a must read for anyone considering themselves an intellectual. Not only are the articles witty and well-researched, they also provide well-articulated arguments to the most pressing (if sometimes slighlty out of date) controversies of the times. Well worth the subscription price, or even the cover price 
Interview is one of my favorite magazines. The interviews are always good. I think that the interviews are more candid since it's done by peers. I also think that the photo shoots in the Interview are some of the best around 
This magazine is like no other. The interviews are fantastic, the pictures are great, and it's very original. I can understand people not liking it if they're used to and prefer the typical, predictable magazine format. It's not for everyone, but for people of a certain people, it's heaven 
OK. For those of you who continue to believe that New York is the center of the United States, Hell, the world, who forgot the map CNN kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that MIGHT infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the US, for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest, the dark states, middle earth, the Elba of the 21st century, you're not. There's a whole world out here. People have jobs. Yes, it's true. We work, send our kids to school, even go to church on Sundays. And on other days too. We vote. Oh, yeah, you already know that. So having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates, is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with Ashley or Uma or Diane, you know, it just doesn't carry a lot of weight with the serfs. But . . . . It's a great magazine. Andy lives. Photography is tight and realistic. The ads are sexy and provocative. The sidebars interesting and insightful. It's wordly. It covers music as well as RS. It's (don't get all riled up now) a fun magazine to read. However, the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine, seem to be along the lines of 'damn, it's so good to be me and I guess you're OK too.' Or, 'I see you're wearing a $15,000 Versace with a plunging neckline and . . . you've selected old, black, Converse All Stars to wear with it! How Noveau! How tasteful!' Come on. Where's the bite? Where's the interview with Alex Rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy . . . it's only New York?' or with Marv Alpert 'hey what's on your fashion agenda now?' Chris Berman from ESPN says he was on Maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into Steven Stills with his kids. Now that's a conversation I would have liked to hear, not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation (it sure isn't an interview - see Columbia University's Interviewing 101 in their School of Journalism) are off to pick out furniture. It's New York. Show your teeth. Flex. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury 
Interview is a small magazine with big ambitions. All the latest news in entertainment, fashion, and politics can be found within it's colorful pages. The photography is amazing, and grand in scale, although the magazine is packed full of ads (which are equally as colorful I might add). This is NOT entertainment weekly- Interview is the indi-film of magazines, and the people and films it covers are not usually those found in typical magazines. Instead of focusing on the actor du jour, Interview covers the up coming, the soon to be, and the undiscovered. The interview formats are fascenating and unique, as most are done by celebrities, of celebrities. If one is looking for typical hollywood gossip, Warhol's masterpiece is not for them. At such a cheap price, Interview is a gem that is yet undiscovered by many. I highly recommend it 
I know "Interview" has been around awhile, but I just recently got into it. In short, if you're into the arts, it's your magazine. It touches on music, movies, fashion, and everything inbetween. And often the interviews of celebrities are done by other celebs, like "Jim Jarmusch" doing a Q&amp;A with "The White Stripes", just like they're sitting in a room chatting, very casual. I like that. Also the photography is tops, and often takes up the whole page (good mini-posters). They're good about not exposing the same old people too, lots of fresh faces, usually cool. Hey, if it's good enough for "Andy Warhol", it can't be bad, huh 
I love this magazine. have subscribed since it started and I always loved it's sexy women (cuz i'm one ;) hilarious and satyr filled articles and it's no-nonsense attitude. I agree with another reviewer that there is a definite diffrence as of late but until it gets real horrible i'll keep on reading 
Maxim is a good magazines for adult males. I enjoy all articles and their website, too. It is more affordable subscrition 
Yes, I know it's weird that I like reading Maxim. But Maxim has inspired me of doing my job. I'm glad that Amazon sell its subscription. It's fantastic. My husband loves it too. It's not just the sexy hot women covers, but also what's inside. Informative, complete, and relevant 
This is a wonderful mag. More things should be literary yet down to earth like this journal. Without a doubt this is one of the best places to find great fiction and poetry 
This is one of the best literary journals I have seen in years! The content is broad and interesting (a good mix of fiction and poetry), and it seemed like I had a new surprise in store for me every time I turned the page 
"The Economist" is a great weekly magazine with in-depth, balanced and enlightening journalism. The articles are largely expertly written by knowledgeable people. The writing in "The Economist" is interesting and insightful with articles conveying detailed and yet condensed information. The magazine has contributions from senior people from all over the world, making it interesting and relevant to a worldwide readership. The editors and journalists of the Economist need to be applauded for the broad range of well-written articles with balanced analysis every week. Reading this magazine ensures that I know what is happening worldwide every week, although I do not always agree with some positions the magazine takes. This is recommended reading for business leaders and decision makers who require a diverse range of views and information about what is happening at different places in the world on subjects as diverse as politics, current affairs, science and technology, national, regional and global issues, finance, trade, and development. Even Great People like Nelson Mandela relied on this magazine for news during his long years in prison. 
I live internationally and have been reading The Economist every week since the 1997 Asian crisis and it's probably my most productive habit. I read it pretty much cover to cover most weeks and that takes a good 2-3 hours. I massacre it during the week, roll it up, squeeze it into my handbag and rip pages out to take with me to any place I am potentially going to be bored. Reading The Economist makes you smarter. I am not kidding or craven. It does it by: - Improving your reading skills, and reading makes you smarter. It uses the language really well. It makes it easier for you to read harder things with quicker comprehension. - Affecting your writing style - you find their writing style stays in your head and affects the way you write. - It introduces you to wonderful books and encourages reading through their references and opinions - you eventually get around to thinking 'I should really check that book out to see what the fuss is about'. Discussions and reviews in The Economist got me reading Adam Smith, Charles Darwin and Proust among a wide range of others. You learn from books like these and learning makes you smarter. It puts the daily news you get into a context. I remember feeling total frustration during the Bosnian war. I saw the news everyday - but I never understood the overall story - what was behind it? You heard that it was historical and "there's always trouble in the Balkans" like that was enough of an explaination for that kind of horror. Now, after almost 10 years of reading The Economist, when I watch the news I am more aware of the context - the background story and how these events might fit in. It's an enjoyable read - absorbing and occasionally very funny. There a few things more geeky than bursting out laughing while reading The Economist - but unexpected laughter is a good thing! The Christmas issue has lots of additional quirky articles - e.g. on Barbie Torture by small boys (my brother did that!). The Economist is liberal in the proper sense in that it supports the rights and responsibilities of the individual, small government/low taxes, and pragmatism. So you find it supports ; - Legal and safe contraception and abortion. I am currently pregnant and very aware that given how hard it is, it's for volunteers. - Ending the prohibition on drugs to be consistent with personal freedom, deal with the health issues, and reduce the source of funding to crime and terrorism. - Letting people's own choice and not the choice of the majority, determine who they marry. - Free trade as the most effective method of poverty reduction the world has ever had access to. The Economist is for people who have a craving for reality. It's for grownups. 
This is the most accurate geo-political and socio-economic English-language news-weekly there is. Period. Articles are succinct, top-notch, and cover everything from the world today to business, economics to the environment. I do think the magazine tends to focus a bit too little on the environment and religion, but that is my perception. Despite the editorial style and very sophisticated diction, articles are still easy to understand. True, this magazine (or newspaper, as it calls itself) is staunchly pro-democracy (i.e. broadly speaking, anti-Russian policy, anti-Chinese policy in their respective conflicts, say, over Georgia or Taiwan, and pro-war on the Iraq issue), pro-free trade, and pro-European (i.e. for the expansion of the EU). But it takes many conservative and liberatarian positions, too, and oftentimes even liberal ones, which, overall, makes the magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most of the points-of-view after reading just a few articles on the same subject, although the Economist usually does imply, or sometimes downright state, which position it takes or the world must take. Actually that's the best part: it is very refreshing to have a magazine that is not afraid to share its opinion and offer its advice to readers, hence its influence. This, for me, is the icing on the cake. As an economics and international relations student, I have been receiving The Economist for some three years already. In that short time span, it has been a source -- usually the main source -- of dozens of my essays and country reports (the country or topical surveys published every several weeks are excellent for this!) and reading the magazine has increased my English vocabulary significantly. I finally feel that my vocabulary has increased from third-grade level to college-level. Yes, it does indeed take a few weeks to get used to the unique writing style, but the magazine is indispensible. To some it may appear arrogant, which is what I tend to sense at times, but that does not mean it is a bad magazine. Quite simply, it tends to think of itself as sophisticated, and rightfully so. While half-owned by the Financial Times, many of The Economist's authors also write for the latter, which can help explain while the two are similar. But while the Financial Times is a daily newspaper with fairly brief articles and a 50-50 slant on news and finance/business, the economist's articles, while also succinct, focus on everything in the world that impacts people. And that is why it's an excellent summary of the world this week for those people with little time on their hands. Finally, I do not necessarily sense an anti-Semitic slant as stated in one previous review. Yes, I am Jewish, but I tend to regard The Economist's proposed solutions -- such as dealing with Hamas politically (despite their "militancy"), as they cannot be destroyed -- to of the Middle East conflict as mere pragmatism at work. The same with its proposal to legalize various drugs. Not that both of these things will ever happen in today's world (the Mid-East conflict won't end; drugs won't be decriminalized in most countries), but the thinking is purely pragmatic, which is refreshing for a world so increasingly bent on political correctness. In this respect, as in the aforementioned ones, I feel the magazine is a lot more objective overall than many others, despite the specific positions it takes in particular articles. It makes for a truly fascinating read. It is most surely the investment it claims to be, so for any of those with any remaining doubts, the $129 subscription price ($77 for students) is more than worth it. Just read three or four issues and you'll see. Trust me 
This is how Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, described his impression of the magazine. Although a little overhyped, I could'nt put it more succintly. It makes you think and makes you laugh. Read it 
This is not solely a magazine for financial news. Writers from various points of view give the reader a great depth of research in their reporting. Precise coverage on current events, science, law, medicine, economics, politics, and technological news that you will not find anywhere else. I would say the thrust of the magazine is "libertarian light." It is simply the best news source in the English speaking world 
I could not carry on with life as I know it without the Economist. No hype. It's that good. This American reviewer became hopelessly addicted to the Economist's news and analysis during four years in England. The magazine - or 'newspaper', as it stubbornly insists on calling itself - is published from London, though as of 2005 the largest national readership is in the United States. The editorial line is libertarian in the more moderate European sense of the word. The essential values are individual liberty, a modest state, and free market economics. Don't let the name fool you. This weekly is far more than an economist's rag. Its anonymous writing on current events if fabulous, not to mention top-ranked analysis of letters, arts, and the like. Let me give you a concrete example of how the Economist excels. For years, I have paid close attention to its coverage of Latino and immigration issues in the USA. One might suppose that a British magazine would be at a disadvantage when exploring this complex topic, yet the Economist's coverage routinely surpasses that of US newspapers and magazines, perhaps largely because of its disdain for self-suppressing 'PC' tactics. The only area in which I detect broad deficiency in this magazine's coverage is in the role of religion, particularly in America. The secularist European spectacles its editors wear seem to make it impossible for them to canvass this phenomenon with a view that religion's continued fervor in advanced Western nations is something other than retrograde and slightly amusing. I tell my university-age nephews - thankfully, they ask - to anchor their news consumption in one weekly, then to read widely beyond it. The Economist is the very best anchor available to English-reading sailors 
The Economist has to be the best weekly magazine for current events. Whether you are conservative or liberal you will appreciate the well thought out and reasoned essays that this magazine has to offer. I don't think this will end up swaying people's political opinions too much but it will at least provide an informed opinion. Americans know too little about the world around them and this is the perfect tool for fixing that. There are arguments that this magazine swings on both sides of the political fence depending on your views. I have my opinions on this but still love it. The articles I disagree with force me to think and hone my own debates. To compare this magazine with Newsweek or Time is like comparing a precision automobile with one of those 25 cent rides kids enjoy. Sure they make the motions of a car, and look like a car but in the end they don't go anywhere and you wasted your money with nothing to show for it. This magazine does more with its short essays than Newsweek could ever do with its six-page layouts. Too bad there isn't a "teen" version of this magazine. That would do a lot to rectify America's education problems. I find the argument that some people cite that this magazine has a severe pro-laissez faire bias is ridiculous at best. It is like criticizing Auto magazines for having a combustion engine bias. This is a magazine of economics. Since laissez faire economics is the basis for just about every single economy in the world, they concentrate on it. Sorry but Marxist and Keynesian economic models didn't pan out. Maybe if feudilism mounts a come back they might change their focus, until then we are stuck with reality. 
Aperture has one of the most outstanding reputations for bringing its readers the best in artistic photography. I own several editions of the publication which are put up in areas where they will be kept cool and dry because the magazine is so highly collectible. Some editions on auction have netted hundreds of dollars. And Aperture covers a wide array of subjects, from mailboxes out on country roads, to architecture, from rare plants, to bizarre special effects, Aperture brings you photography you'll want to look at again and again and again. You'll get photographs from some of the world's most renowned photographers, and you'll get them on pages so pristine, you'd think you were viewing them at a gallery. If you want a magazine that gives you "The All" in photography, Aperture has it. Oh, and one more note, from time to time Aperture offers its customers the opportunity to purchase rare collectibles, many of which are autographed by the photographers 
Aperture mixes interesting pictures, that are satisfying to the eye with more mainstream pictures that would appeal to all categories of photographers. Aperture is for those who do not like there pictures characteristic of so called "normal family pictures" These pictures are amazing... Aperture magazine is amazing...If you are thinking that it is not worth the price, think again because Aperture will definantly have you taking and seeing your pictures in a whole new light 
I have subscribed for years to this - in my opinion, the hand's-down best, most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available. Practical, solidly researched, non-preachy and impeccably edited, it provides even-handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog's happiness, well-being and ability to be a good companion. The annual dog-food ratings alone are worth the subscription price. Every constituency should be as well-served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one 
This is a great publication for the person who takes their dogs health and well being seriously. Each month I look forward to receiving my Journal. I breed shih tzu puppies and this journal has answered many questions that have come up. All new dog owners would appreciate this as a gift. 
I used to read Dog Fancy, which is a great magazine also. However, I'm more interested in dog general health and wellness than seeing articles on specific breeds and at least half the magazine is advertising. Our 2 kids are mutts. I started reading the articles of which one was on the best dry dog food. Not seeing my brand was very eye opening. Another on supplements for older dogs verified what I had already been doing for years. I use natural remedies on our dogs whenever possible. I've now read through 4 issues and love the magazine. A recent article describes vaccinations and what issues to consider in determining whether your dog REALLY needs a particular one. There are definitely those that are necessary (like rabies) and others that depend on the area you live in. After reading it, it cleared up a few questions for me. I think of this magazine as a 'Consumer Reports' for dogs, since there's no advertising in it either. There are product reviews and they're very well written, tell you a product's features as well as cost, the pros and cons. The magazine's website also allows you to read the issue online and you can download it to your desktop. My family and I are definitely sold on the magazines. We give it 2 paws up! 
I love this journal! I am very interested in the very best for my pets and this is the place to find out about things like food and training. I found this at my college's resource center for their veterinary technician program - so, it is highly recommended by more than just myself 
I've subscribed to Cooking Light for about 5 yrs now. Here are the things I like: 90% of the recipes are very good, many absolutely fabulous. It gives you all nutritional information so when I'm on weight watchers I can easily convert it to points. Most ingredients are simple that I can find at a regular grocery store and I don't have to go to some specialty food store to find it 
After 14 days in Italy with nothing but Pizza-Pasta, Pasta-Pizza, thang God for this magazine jam packed with lovely light and lightening recipes and ideas. This mag is a blessing 
Okay, this magazine ROCKS! The recipes are absolutely wonderful and easy to make. Plus, they're healthy!! What could be better than that?? In terms of healthy cooking, this magazine is my #1 fav, with Rachael Ray's new magazine a close 2nd 
I have been receiving Cooking Light for about 10 years now. I love this magazine. Frankly, it is about the only place I go for recipies. The first thing I do each month is go to the back of the magazine and right to the Index page and check out the "Greatest Hits" for that issue. That is where I start. I would love to make more from CL, but just don't have the time. I do love the web site and use it extensively for recipe searches. Even tho CL offers the yearly recipe index, it is easier for me to find it on line, print it, then put it in my 3 ring binder. Thanks CL for such a great magazine 
I have been subscribing to cooking light for three years now and it never disappoints me. There are lots of recipes, usually 85 - 90 to issue, so I am a little confused with those whom complain that there are not enough. There is a wide variety also, from the crazy and unique to the regular but re-vamped. I do not have kids but I have made several recipes, such as Mini Ice Cream Cakes and Chicken and Dumplings that I would deem perfectly acceptable for younger children. My only warning to perspective buyers is that some recipes can be quite time consuming and some ingredients are quite expensive. When I get in a pinch I will substitute something close if I don't feel like shelling out the extra money. Overall I am very pleased with the magazine; both the living and recipe sections 
This magazine has great recipies! Most of them are incredibly easy, but there are a few "adventuresome" ones every once in a while to try when you feel up to a challenge. Sometimes the recipies need a few more spices, so I usually add more than they say (heck, it doesn't change the calorie count). However, Cooking Light does not trade calories for taste, so the whole family likes the meal and there are MANY recipies that I would proudly serve to company (the majority, in fact). There are also just a TON of recipies per issue. The only negative things I would say is that a few of the recipies are only marginally "healthy" and sometimes there's some redundancy. Overall, it's a GREAT buy 
For anyone who loves farms, horses, and stories of life in the countryside written by readers. Beautiful pictures. Magazines: "Country", "Country Extra", and "Farm and Ranch" from Reiman Publications 
Has insightful articles about what's hot in the business world. Great articles on tech companies and wonderful ideas about how to get rich. Honestly the best thing about this magazine is that it gives an immense amount of motivation and inspiration to the reader. I would agree with one of the reviewers, however, that it tends to go off course. It has great potential and is definitely worth subscribing to 
Go into high gear man! Great Business mag! What you do not know you will know, if you buy this mag. Read on man ! 
This is not your father's business magazine. Picked it up for the first time in a doctor's office and stole the issue (on real estate) 
If you're going to publish a business magazine, then you should publish articles that are useful to people in business. Business 2.0 does this, but only with every second or so issue. In between, they publish a lot of vapid, unfocused material that is unworthy of publication anywhere. The good articles are worth enough to me that I'll continue to subscribe, but I wish they'd get their act together 
I have been a subscriber for some time. It's a business publication that does not focus solely on Wall Street financials - they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for. Think entrepreneur or general business topics and that's Business 2.0. It does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree - think `oddball' as well. Monthly sections include `What's Next', `What Works', `What's Cool'. The articles are cutting edge in some cases, well researched and well written with an informal slant. They cover tech, marketing, product development, product design, ideas, new products and services, M's and a wide range of general business topics. You will find out about new things before most of your coworkers, giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler, happy-hour settings. To go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market/s, the ads include autos like Camry, Land Rover LR3, Mini Cooper and even the Porsche Boxster, Laptops, Business Productivity Software like Office 2003, Business Products like copiers and printers, Mobile calling plans, HP, Credit Cards and even Lufthansa airline. So if you are not in this demographic, maybe they're not targeting your demographic. Why Buy: You are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation' of your career. You are entrepreneurial minded. You want to keep on top of a wide range of business topics and even some that are not yet making the news. As a gift for someone with these interests 
Business 2.0 is one of the few business magazines I read on a monthly basis, and just recently extended for another 2 years. One of the most valuable aspects of this magazine is their analysis of the bleeding edge companies - I don't want to limit my reading to case studies and best practices from the biggest, most obviously successful companies. I want to know what the startups are doing, and what the oddball companies with new ideas are doing differently. Not everything is going to apply, but since your own business must constantly evolve, I like a magazine that focuses on the constant changes of a variety of businesses. Why four stars? To be honest, when the magazine was purchased by its current parent company a couple years back, I feel the quality took a bit of a hit. I don't care for the new design, though I'm sure it saved a few dollars. And the number/quality of articles also slid a bit. But all in all its still one of the better business magazines out there, and by far the best in the "new economy" sector 
This magazine is published every month. For me it's a big event. I can't wait to finger though the pages, look at the articles, and read the columns from my favorite writers like Molly Ivans. If you are a conservative this magazine is not for you but if you are a moderate, or some where on the left you will love this magazine! Senator Robert Lafollette R-WI originally founded it. He ran for president in 1924 under the Progressive party (which has since died out). He received 4,826,471 popular votes and 13 electoral votes. It was one of the first publications ever to publish the writings of Martian Luther King and has since been a strong voice against the war in Iraq. This magazine should be cherished for being well progressive. 
Taking the reins from Erwin Knoll (R.I.P.), Mr. Rothschild has very ably continued the great work of progressive / left commentary and articles. A terrific publication. Check out www.progressive.org for timely updates on national goings-on 
I subscribe to a few magazines, most of which are somewhat longwinded and tedious. The progressive does not follow that path. It's also a very informative magazine. For example, in one article I learned the following items about Democrat John Kerry: (1) He gets a good bit of money from a telecommunications industry's lobbyist "Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo". (2) "He has sponsored legislation to help telecommunications companies buy up the public airwaves." (3) He thinks "we should all have `smart cards' - electronic IDs with our health history encoded on them." (4) He "has voted for every free trade pact to come his way in the Senate since the Cold War." (5) AFL-CIO is backing Kerry even though he declined to answer there questionnaire on trade. All of these came from one article: "Triumph of the Bland" by Ruth Conniff (page 12-13 in issue April 2004). If your like informative information, check out this magazine 
This is a great magazine. As a liberal I find every month full of socialist articles. Great publication 
A few weeks ago, I started building my first PC from scratch and have found Computer Shopper magazine the best resource. The reviews and articles really helped me decide what parts to use, and the recent "how to" guide on assembling a PC was a godsend. I don't think there's another magazine out there that provides such in-depth advice -- their writers really know what they're talking about! Plus, if I can't find what I'm looking for in the magazine itself, Computer Shopper's Web Buyer directs me to the sites where I can find what I need -- both technical help and the cheapest parts. I can't thank them enough for saving me all that time I would have spent surfing the Internet myself. I'd definitely recommend that anyone interested in customizing their own PC should sign up for Computer Shopper 
This magazine is a pretty good magazine. it has a reviews on laptops, desktops hardware, sofware, and mobile computer stuff. it also has some good articles. it is inexpensive, and tells you about every website on the net that sell computer stuff.it is made by cdnet 
There are many reasons to love this great magazine and a few reasons not to. One of the reasons not to is there many ads, but if you want to read what great writers write you have to make reading The New Yorker on your top 10 list 
in a world where hype and superficial journalism has reached new dimensions, the new yorker is an amazing world in itself. there goes rarely an article left unread by the time a new issue arrives, the lure of many worlds to explore and promise to really learn about life as it is now. most of all, it's definitely worth the time. 
Along with the New York Review of Books, The New Yorker is a must weekly read for me. I read it, cover to cover except for the ads, for 45 minutes to an hour each night before sleep. Roger Angell on baseball is the best; Lane and Denby tag teamming on the movie reviews; Joan Acocella on dance (Dance! I've read more about it than I've ever seen), and the list goes on. Left wing? Several reviewers here said the magazine is left wing. This is hilarious. Obviously these people have never read a left wing maqgazine, and such comments only illustrate the extent to which the political spectrum in the US has shifted rightward. For left wing try: The Nation, The Progressive, Dissent, or Monthly Review. The New Yorker is as middle brow bourgeois as it gets 
I have been a reader for 20 years, but am considering canceling my subscription (I did this once before when it became a Vanity Fair look-alike under Tina Brown). I think the writing is exceptional. My complaint is that the issues have become thinner (with an embarrassingly small "Double-Issue" mid-August). The articles are shorter and edited to end at the bottom of a page, which sometimes breaks the article's flow. It is full of advertising, which pays the bills, but now seems to have squeezed out some of the writing. The articles also do not seem as essential as they had in the past. The political writing is great and the movie reviews by Lane and Denby are the best you will find. 
I got to read this magazine in my local library where you can actually check out magazines and keep them for a week. Soon decided to subscribe it instead of running to the library everyweek. What I like about this magazine is the time it takes for me to finish one article is about the same amount of time it takes me to get tired and want to go to sleep after reading. It covers a variety of issues, such as world politics, health, environment, art, you name it. One thing I need to point out is, English is my second language, so it also helps me improve my vocabulary. And I totally agree with one of the previous reviews, that is you never get to read 3/4 of its content, one thing is certain for me, I never read its fictions. 
New Yorker is one of the best magazines available in the US. It has a good mixture of articles on current events, culture, fiction, humor. And one shouln't forget those notorious cartoons. The lengths of the articles range from the very long to the very short, and should amply sustain one's weekly need for reading material. Please be aware that all articles have a coat of liberal paint. But the New Yorker is probably the most sensible left of center media source in this country 
I have been subscribing to the New Yorker for five years now, and it has been a very enlightening experience. The New Yorker does its part in covering big news stories, but it's not really a news magazine. The perspectives are unique (and admittedly lean to the left), and the kind you're not likely to get elsewhere. The authors use the first person because they tend to be part of the stories they're covering. Take Jon Lee Anderson, probably the most credible reporter covering the Middle East today. His "Letters From" various cities involve accounts of his meetings with locals and leaders. Other segments are more like NPR stories--unique perspectives on largely uncovered topics that aren't time-sensitive. You'll get in-depth looks into developments in medicine, law, architecture, etc., that otherwise wouldn't get on your radar unless you were in that profession. And, the writers incorporate the "larger questions" in stories focused on recent events. Like Malcolm Gladwell's recent account of a playwright who plagiarized material from a former article written by him. He parlayed his personal struggle into a good summary of legal and ethical positions on the use or development of one person's idea by another. I have grown to look forward to reading the Fiction selection each week. Sometimes I don't like the piece, but I enjoy getting the chance to read writers that I normally wouldn't and those that I normally would. Additionally, the magazine has added more dedicated issues--most recently the "Food" issue, in addition to standbys like the "Style" and "Fiction" issues. I loved the "Food" issue, especially one writer's account of the search for truly authentic pasta that involved a work night in Mario Batali's kitchen and a trip to Italy. I enjoy the balance of hard news, balanced interest stories, and arts that the New Yorker provides. I began my subscription to get a different perspective than what I got from local Southern news, and I keep it for the same reasons and many more 
The New Yorker has a lot to offer as a magazine but it's a mixed bag. Some weeks it has excellent feature articles on topics I'm very interested in and other weeks not. I used to subscribe but now I buy off the newsstand when the topics it covers are of particular interest. The New Yorker should get raves for being a serious and somewhat intellectual magazine. The feature articles are very in-depth and are from top-notch investigative journalists. The magazine's coverage of Al Queda, terrorism, Afghanistan, and the intelligence community have been absolutely superb. It falters a little, in my opinion, on its coverage of national politics. Nevertheless, typically the feature articles are meaty and in-depth, if sometimes a bit dry and tedious. The rest of the magazine is also a mixed bag. I don't live in New York city so the city specific stuff is of little interest to me. A lot of times the weekly features are interesting and other times not. Overall I rate the magazine highly, but it's not one that I would read on a weekly basis. 
I just picked JANE up off the newsstands - and am thrilled that there is finally a womens magazine out there of substance. The music references as well as the humorous tone are refreshing!! Thank you JANE for having a different voice!! 
My friends and I love this magazine even more now that Brandon Holley is the Editor. The fashion, music, celebrity technology content is even better. Amazing! 
I love JANE mag these days! It's like a total bible for my life - the fashion is so cute and I can actually afford the stuff in there! It's got so much color and energy - I was inspirired by every page. No articles on diets or how to plz men. I want to hang and go shopping with all the writers and girls in the magazine - cool smart chicks who still love fashion :) No other women's magazine has such cool pages on beauty, all the others write about botox, but JANE doesn't do that. And love the "pranks" - the world needs to laugh a little more! 
This magazine is my absolute favorite, I feel like the editors are people I'd actually be friends with. I also check out French mags like Jalouse for their fashion and JANE feels more like that than a typical American mag. The music reviews are right on, a great mix of indy and pop. Plus this is the only magazine that actually makes me laugh out loud when I read it. 
Just got my subscription and Jane ROCKS! Finally, a women's magazine that has great fashion AND a sense of humor! Jane's really is different from everything else out there. I love it! 
I'm in love with the October Jane cover w/ Christina Aguilera, she looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g! What I love about Jane is their total understanding of 20 yr olds, UM ME! The magazine has gone through quite a re-vamp, loved the Bonnaoo piece. I was there this summer and it was awesome! So needless to say, I had to sign up for a year subscription of Jane 
LOVE JANE....the new editor really knows how to put together a magazine that really speaks to me me. FASHION, BEAUTY, MUSIC what else could a girl ask for. THIS IS A MUST READ, MUST SUBSCRIBE 
Wow, I've just picked up my third issue of JANE (I think it's October) and I have to say, I am HOOKED. I've been checking it out since I saw the cover with Heidi Klum. Great band information that already makes me feel cooler, and the fashion is beyond amazing. I keep staring at the mailbox, waiting for the next issue. Jenny, 2 
just read the October issue of JANE and i love the story on Bonnaroo! JANE always has a way of highlighting great fashions and amazing music...my 2 favorite things! -katie c Austin, T 
This is a great magazine offering not only information on general health, but also more specific problems we have today. It focuses on several different topics an issue and provides resources to go to and gain more knowledge. For anyone interested in a more natural approach to todays medicine, food etc. 
There are different types of film magazines. Many are how-to's. Others just give the same blurbs over and over and rehashed and rehashed. This magazine uniquely targets a specific era when this short of films was at there best with a few exceptions due to today's capabilities. The magazine will take only a hand full of topics or subjects and have a full spread on them. This magazine is more of a filmography or a focused biography that just happens to be in magazine form. The accompanying black and white photos are relevant to the subject at hand. Just one of the articles would pay for the whole magazine. 
As a renter of a new house that is completely empty, I needed some ideas for decorating every room. I'm thrilled with Home Magazine! It's got creative ideas for everything from table lamps to kitchen remodels. And they always list websites for where to buy the products right on the page by the product! It doesn't get much easier than that. 
Okay, it's not one of the fancy, traditional mags but I found loads of things that generated ideas. The sections showing design elements carried through the house were my favorites. It may be on the advertising end of the spectrum in some regards, but I liked seeing similar (but different) approaches to the same design goal by various manufacturers. Having all the web addresses made it easy for me to follow-up on designs I liked, and I didn't have to worry that the editors were trying to curry favor with their advertisers by pontificating on the merits of one item over another. I'm a visual learner and this fit the bill. Unlike another reviewer who would suggest that this is due to my gender, I think that people respond differently to the same presentation of material. Don't write this off because it's not a marquee magazine--try it first. You might just like it. And by the way, I do read and like magazines and books that have no pictures, too 
What eles is there in America these days????? This magazine delivers on 2 of the 4. The others are freely available on HGTV and Food Network. But without the money, you can't hardly have 'em. An excellent and important mag 
Put away some cash in mutual funds for retirement. Ideas on current investment thinking (even if it's often good to be contrarian and do the opposite of what they recommend) 
I purchased a value-package of this magazine and Kiplinger's, and I've been thrilled with both. About 20% of the articles and info are over my head, but the balance is understandable, helpful, and easily applied to my average money management skills. I've since ordered a SmartMoney subscription for three friends and relatives 
I'm happy that I ordered a subscription to this magazine as it not only matches, but surpasses the content provided in the Foreign Affairs Journal. The student discount rate I received (at the official foreign policy website) has the most reasonable price. Each new issue of FP contains a barrage of perspectives on numerous topics that are very relevant today. Photos, graphs, and charts also help to breathe life into each article and helped me to better grasp the content presented. This content is also available to subscribers online, with the addition of "web exclusives" and a "FP Blog." I haven't been this happy with a magazine subscription since I first subscribed to The Economist. Well worth the investment of time and money required to read each and every article as it acts as an outstanding supplement to anyone's current subscription to The Economist or Foreign Affairs Journal. Like myself, you won't be disappointed 
Very interesting and enjoyable to read. As a student of political science and international relations, this is a great way to keep updated about the current issues and problems in the international arena. It is not dry or boring. 
I subscribed to multiple photography magazines at first when I started getting serious about photography. I subscribed to 'Photography' and 'American Photo' and this one, Popular Photography and Imaging. Of the three this magazine has the most balanced amount of reviews, 'how tos', digital imaging related topics (Photoshop, etc) as well as some nice contests. Also they seem to sponsor more 'mentor series' type products where you can go to some locale and shoot photos for a reasonable fee. Of all the magazines this also had something that was important to me - half the magazine isn't ads. Photography was the worst offender of this, there'd be 50 or so pages of weak articles, and then 50 pages solid of ads. While this one does have a chunk of ads near the back, it still has a 'back page' article and articles mixed in among the ads. And only 25% of the magazine is advertisements. They also support a nice online website (popphoto.com) and have a forum where people can logon and ask questions. While not as heavily trafficked as say dpreview.com the authors and editors do read and respond to questions. Overall a great magazine for the hobby 
Popular Photography Imaging has a well-deserved reputation for being one of the best photography magazines available, yet it's not nearly as well-written or informative as it was prior to its merging with Modern Photography (If you are interested in checking this out, compare a current issue with one written back in the 1970's for example.). It remains useful for its product reviews, but these - especially of lenses - tend to be rather subjective, and not nearly as critical as a potential user might wish for. And worse yet for an avid amateur or professional photographer, the articles tend to be aimed towards novices, or at least are written as though they would be understood best only by novices. The only redeeming features are Herb Keppler's thoughtful insights on photography and occasional articles which are well written and edited. Otherwise, I would recommend taking a look at other photography magazines, most notably Shutterbug, which I have found to be more useful 
I am "historically impaired". I enjoy hearing "stories" from our past but I can never remember who did what, when. Therefore I don't usually make time for history. Enter "American Heritage" magazine. It is not a tired old rag about the Revolutionary War or who was the best Civil War general. No, it is a magazine full of lively articles on UNUSUAL facts from our history. Get this magazine and get the scoop on the flu that killed a million, the fascinating story of a secret mountain masacre or the plan to play God by cleansing the "feeble minded". Who knew!! Subscribe and be riveted 
Yes - there are tons of great shots in the mag; great articles ( in French only ) , contests---very chic....HOWEVER---- customer service will treat you like the redheaded stepchild when you ask them " WHY HAVE YOU NOT SENT ME THE LATEST ISSUE OF PHOTO?? "....and you know it WILL HAPPEN. They only send you sporadic issues when THEY feel like it ( or so it would seem )... Most issues are available on the stand WEEKS before you get yours delivered via mail ( should it be the other way around??? ) And they wont give you a courtesy letter/postcard telling you when your subscription is up...that's for you to figure out. SO if you can deal with the lame french hold music when you call Photo's Cutomers Service CONSTANTLY, this is a great magazine..... cough...cough...vive la France! 
American photography could only WISH they knew what real photography is. (hint: american publications only knew 2 things-- 1) what's popular, and 2) how to censor everything that said, PHOTO displays exactly that--beautiful photos. leave the american's to their own crap 
I have been subscribing to this mag for a couple years, and think it's one of the best gaming mags available. I have several different consoles, and appreciate that they review games for all platforms. I like the rating system (1-10) instead of the too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5, and find the reviews well written and objective. While I have been gaming for years, I am not necessarily versed in computer lingo, but I never feel like an idiot after reading this mag; the writing is erudite but very easy to understand. I read several different gaming magazines each month, and feel this magazine strikes exactly the right balance between the more serious and more frivolous gaming magazines in the industry. One suggestion: if you have a GameStop or affiliated store in your neighborhood, get your subscription through them. For about $15 you receive a 12-year subscription, and a card that gives you 10% off used games at these stores, as well as an extra 10% trade-in value on your used games (sometimes there will be a coupon in that month's mag to upgrade to 20% for both!). 
I love This magazine! It tells you about every new game that comes out brand new 
I only got the first issue, but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers (hence the name). i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction. They might do well to keep the two separate, especially the contests and events. It's an attractive format and very upscale, high quality literature reviews and advice. The stories are well written and enjoyable, although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers 
There are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read. "Poets Writers" is one of them. It has a literary bent, but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude. It is practical and educational, and is pleasingly presented. A favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing. In the issue out now, there are two major articles. One is about author Stuart Dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on Chicago's colorful South Side. The other is about writing contests, dealing with how ethical they are run, the view of literary judges, and when a writer should considering entering one. The secondary articles are as informative and as useful, whether you want to learn about promoting your book, doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry. Contests, incidentally, are a big part of PW's value. The magazine tells you who won, and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions. PW is careful to screen which contests are listed, ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors. The writing itself is interesting. It is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read. It should be, and in the case of PW, everything is engaging. PW's design is clean. It looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like. The typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing, but get the job done. It is never work to read this magazine. I fully recommend "Poets Writers." You will be better informed about writing and writers, just like the titles implies. Anthony Trendl editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
This magazine is a must have for professional poets 
The Atlantic is a classic cultural, political and literary voice of America. First published by a team that included legendary icons such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, this periodical went on to include articles from great historical figures such as Mark Twain, Woodrow Wilson and Martin Luther King Jr. It may be hard to place current contributors next to those specific individuals who came before them, but they do stand tall with contemparies published in similar venues. This is not a magazine for those who currently feel they are well enough informed from the current crop of "news-tainment" programs, talking heads and mouthpieces found on the air waves today. Here you'll find in-depth, critical analysis and intelligent literature. Will you disagree with some points of view and might you feel compelled to label something in it's pages conservative or liberal? Maybe, but it's understandable in today's climate. I would suggest that you'd probably be trying too hard, perhaps unconsciously, to fit authors and articles into a particular partisan column. The letters to the editor tend to highlight differing points of view so I encourage you to read back in the following month to see how others respond to get a feel for the magazine. I think most reasonable people tend to find this magazine well worth the time to read regularly. Recently there has usually been one full length article related to an issue in the Middle East each month, which should be expected with current events, but the content varies significantly within each issue that you won't feel overwhelmed. There are regular sections and columns ranging from travel to book reviews to fiction to a "post mortem" profiling some notable world figure who has recently passed away. By way of comparison, Harper's and The New Yorker are probably the closest in style, though The New Yorker comes out weekly (mostly) instead of monthly (mostly) like the Atlantic and Harper's. If you're trying to decide between the three, pick up each of them for two or three months and see which you like best. I prefer to Atlantic overall, but if I have time, I may pick up one or the other if some particular topic in it is particularly of interest to me. Bottom line is, you could do a lot worse than subscribe to The Atlantic 
I'm 25 years old and new to The Atlantic [Monthly]. Not having read the publication for some twenty-odd decades like the rest of the reviewers, my opinion is this: The magazine is wonderful. It's infinitely more literate and illuminating than most other periodicals. I'm letting my subscription to TIME run out (talk about an "also-ran"...). Some of what the other reviewers have said is true: There do seem to be an awful lot of stories about war/armed forces, and at times I would concede a slight liberal bend. But neither are enough to dissuade me from continuing my subscription. So "younger" readers, my advice is switch off the TV, throw out your news weeklies, and subscribe. (But keep visiting CNN.com to stay abreast of current news--this is only a monthly magazine! 
My sense is that 'The Atlantic' is a less literary magazine than it used to be. My sense is also that since the loss of Michael Kelly , a courageous and wise journalist, the magazine has declined in quality. The 'Atlantic' does however provide some of the best 'high- brow journalism' being done today. Its decision to send Bernard Henri- Levy in the footsteps of DeToscqueville may not have led to a second great classic by a foreigner about America but did provide some interesting European perceptions - and a reaffirmed sense of what is special about the United States. The 'Atlantic' is still one of the very best popular intellecual magazines in America. 
I discovered the AM some 2 or 3 years ago. Since then, I have become an addicted reader to it. More than to any other magazine at the moment. Let's start saying what the AM is not: is not about news, is not about business, is not about nice and colored pictures. The AM has two main focuses. One is current affairs, with a special focus on the macro conditions of the US (mainly economy and politics) and international affairs. The other one is the arts, with a special focus in reviewing high-quality (and sometimes rare) books. I like the AM for its focus in current affairs. In this monthly you will read long articles about issues like, to cite some examples that come to mind: - Simulation of a principals meeting to discuss alternatives to engage with North Korea - War game of an attack to Iran - Presidential candidates, their lives and their campaign strategies - State of affairs of the American educational system - Potential causes of an eventual economic crisis in the US The AM sits in the same "hall of fame" as The Economist and Foreign Affairs. The main differences are that The Economist has a relatively short time frame and thus focuses on the news of the week and what they mean for the mid term. Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, is more scholarly in nature. The AM sits somehow in the middle. It is written mainly by senior journalists (so it's less scholarly) and its monthly focus allows it to disentangle itself from the relative "sameness" of every week's news. The AM goes beyond the "futility" of news reporting but stops before it gets into the "boringness" of scholarly writing. If you want to enrich your view of the world with a quality monthly, if you are open-minded and are willing to read new points of view, if you want to get closer to the real issues behind foreign and economic policy, the AM is for you. On the other hand, if you have more "short-term" preocupations, if you are more "closed" than open to new points of view, or if you want to look at international and economic matters with a more scientific approach, then the AM is not for you. Again, as I said, the AM also has an "Arts" section. It's very good but it's not the reason why I buy it. Other may 
We had a subscription from 2001-2004. In the last year of that subscription, the magazine came to focus more and more on politics, and most of the political articles were written from a conservative perspective or assuming a neoconservative world view as background. Letters disagreeing with anything Robert Kaplan wrote were rarely, if ever, printed. (Though I know for a fact they received them!) We dropped our subscription and picked up the New Yorker instead. Conservatives however may want to take a new look at this magazine. The reviews suggesting it is liberal must be based on pre-2003 reading. Occasional issues we have bought since dropping our subscription confirm that the conservative slant is persisting. The quality of the writing is still reasonable however, and it explores issues in depth (albeit from one side) 
This review refers to "Writer's Digest" Magazine Subscription... I renewed my subscription to WD magazine late this time around, and had withdrawal symptoms for the two months I went without. This is a fabulous periodical for all writer's, especially for those hoping to be published. The Magazine is chock full of helpful articles to point you in the "write" direction. Newly published Authors are interviewed and share their experiences and secrets. Every month there will be some kind of grammar(not my strong suit) or spelling quiz, that may seem easy to some, but may also come in real handy some day. Tips for writing the query letter that will get noticed by editors,words of wisdom from editors and publishers letting you know what they are looking for(and what not to do as well), monthly writing "assignments"(these make great warmers for the blocked writer)that you can send in for a possible prize,and advice for both fiction and non-fiction is abundant. WD will answer the gazillion questions you have. Should you use a Print On Demand? How to tell the good from the bad. Finding a good and honest agent.How to spot a fraud! What to look for when signing a contract.Advice for the writer of every age and every genre. They always seem to know the questions I have. Each month in "Pitch This Niche" a list of publishers looking for specialty articles or books can be found(could be anything from travel to video game articles), and in "The Markets" you'll find Trade magazines, book publishers, agents, contests for a variety of styles. You'll find out what they want(fiction, non-fiction, number of words etc), and how to submit you manuscripts to them.There is something for everyone. I have found this section most helpful. Everything, even all of the ads are geared toward the writer. Added to WD's own annual writing contests, which has many categories to enter in, you will find other contests that may interest you.Websites to share experiences with other writers are listed, ads for self-publishing, for workshops, and of course books about writing are to be found as well. I'm always happy to see my WD in my mailbox. It's always on time, and the subscription price here is better then the one I pay from the kids who come around selling magazines. I read it cover to cover, and have a hard time throwing even the really old ones away. Whether you are writing a mystery,a book of poems, a spiritual essay,a screenplay, or an article for your favorite magazine, this a treasure chest of useful info for the aspiring writer, and it is quite motivating as well. Write On!....Laurie 
I don't subscribe to many writing magazines, but Writer's Digest is one I subscribe to. It's packed full of useful information for the novelist, short story writer, poet, or freelancer. Writer's Digest has helped me to learn the craft of fiction writing, and the articles here are the best you'll find anywhere. Subscribe to this awesome mag. You won't regret it. Lee Tasey Author of "The Gospel of Arnie 
I call Writer's Digest a writing tool because for years many writers have relied upon the information given within the pages of this thin monthly magazine. As soon as I began writing I started buying this magazine and reading it with a highlighter close at hand. It provides information for all corners of the writing industry, whether it's from starting a story to selling an article to doing the taxes at the end of the year; everything here is geared toward making a writer's life just a bit easier (and for those of you who are attempting this as career, you know just how important something like this could be). To add to that, there are a lot of inspirational articles and sections that can give a young writer the push needed to get writing. So, to anyone interested in writing of any form (fiction or non-fiction) then this should be your first step into the field (followed by some education, of course). Writer's Digest to me is almost as important as my Word Processor or dictionary. 
This monthly magazine is an opinionated breath of fresh air. It's philosophically allied with Libertarianism, but it is not extreme or strident. Reason is more mainstream and moderate than the left or the right; it's really about political common sense. I don't always agree with the articles, but I rarely object to the reasoning that supports them. For a point of view that isn't beholden to agendas or special interests, read Reason. 
Mr. Hayek apparently despises free thought. Furthermore, his ignorance of libertarian philosophy is clear; discounting his opinion is appropriate. I'm guessing he is a Republicrat and finds the socialist ideas found in the corrupt two party system satisfying. Funny considering his namesake, Frederich Hayek, is one of the greatest libertarian thinkers of all time and one of my personal heros. But, I digress: Reason magazine has been in my mailbox every month for well over 20 years and I would buy a lifetime subscription if I could. Not every issue is a five star issue, but on the whole Reason is the most interesting periodical on the market. That said, Reason has dropped a notch in quality ever since the brilliant Virginia Postrel left the editor's post several years ago. She is a true intellectual and kept Reason at a consistently high level. I still love to read my issue every month and while I don't always agree with the positions I am always stimulated 
Reason is never afraid to show opposing views. It allows you to see things in a different light. It is also nice to be able to read a magazine with articles that are greater than 3 pages 
Reason cannot be labeled conservative or leftist. Nor is it an extremist libertarian magazine like Liberty, fawning over Ayn Rand. It bases its commentary on the assumption that, if we have some faith, our chaotic culture will lead somewhere good. But if we try to monitor and control it excessively, we will dampen human creativity and end up muddled and conflicted. Reason takes on all aspects of culture and assumes an international perspective. Its arguments are laid out carefully but contain a percolating sense of indignation at our increasingly repressive environment. At the same time, they are more informative than polemical; each report is grounded in specifics - quotes, anecdotes, studies. This is the most intelligent and inquiring "political" journal available. If only it came out more often 
I was annoyed that this magazine seems to equate "mature woman" with "has kids". I enjoy the realistic fashion tips and advice, and I get annoyed with Cosmo's teenage attitude, but I'd like to see more about careers to balance out the "how to be a mom who does it all" sections. And yes, I'm not kidding...there's a regular section on being a mom who does it all. This mag will appeal to those who are in the mom/work category. Those of us who do not have kids but are still "grown up" will be a little left behind 
I really like this magazine, even if its a woman's magazine. Often I find these types of magazines filled with advertisements and articles that never seem to fit a real persons every day life. This magazine features a nice cross section of information on fashion, decorating, cooking, and relationships. I always find something interesting to read in here 
I really like the fact that the publishers really listen to their readers. Every year (or is it twice a year?) there is a survey included in the magazine for people to give their opinions about articles they enjoy and those they would rather do without. I've been reading this for the past 2 years at my local bookstore (and finally subscribed earlier this year). I've seen an improvement not only in the magazine's layout, but in the content as well. I really like how there are "sections" on personal well-being, fashion, motherhood, etc. Since I'm not a parent (yet), I can easily skip over the motherhood section. Because of the layout, it's not hard to flip through and find what I'm looking for 
I get a magazine every month and I have to say Redbook has gripping stories, and amazing deals. I bought my first copy of Redbook in August of this year and lets just say I wasted no time sending off for my subscription. I look forward to recieving my magazine every month and if you haven't signed up already... your missing out!! 
Details is a men's magazine like Cosmopolitan is for women. The contents of Details is like that of other men's magazines like GQ and Esquire, but Detials has a tendency to have more articles on movie stars (such as in the May 05' edition with articles about movie stars: Mat Dillon, and Mark Wahlberg)along with articles on politics/recent news, etc. BUT, Details also has articles on: fashion, culture, food and drink, movies, music, books, etc. Detials magazine is more for individuals who want to know about news/politics among other things than for someone who is more geared towards fashion. 
still talking about the 'asian thing'? - get a grip!! this is the best magazine on the market. period. it speaks to you in an honest matter and the info is top rated. there just is no better men's magazine without a nude centerfold. 
A friend of mine told me about "Fast Company" a year ago, and I have been a subscriber and avid reader since then. The magazine is enigmatic, combining a news magazine, cultural commentary, business reporting, and entrepreneurial insights into one publication. Many issues deserve a five star rating, but occasionally cohesion and editorial focus is a bit uneven. The thing I most like about "Fast Company" is the 21st century approach to news and analysis: it is thought provoking, explores all sides of complex issues, but never tries to tell the reader what to think. A perfect example of this is in the April, 2006 issue in the article "Al Jazeera's (Global) Mission," in which a former US Marine now working for the English-language version of Al Jazeera is profiled in an extremely multi-faceted story. The entrepreneurial bent of the magazine is great for younger managers and small business professionals, and the reporting on market trends is second to none. Although there are times I don't agree with the articles or editorials in "Fast Company," I always find them intellectually stimulating and thought provoking. I recommend this magazine to independent thinkers everywhere 
Fast Company is an excellent magazine that covers many different subjects in the business field. Not just financial information but how human relations and innovative ideas have and will change the face of business. An excellent product at any price 
There was a time when I read a lot of magazines. I found there being too much fluff and not enough stuff. I was introduced to Fast Company in 1997, and have been a subsriber for most if not all of the last 8 years. Every issue has relevant topics on the current state of business. It has stayed with a formula that has worked; that business in constantly changing, and to reflect back on the past when something has changed that they once wrote on. I heartily recommend this must read to anyone who wants to make a difference in the business world 
Buy a magazine, mail in the subscription card. The magazines are faster to first issue and if you use Amazon it is IMPOSSIBLE to change the mailing address. I got one issue, moved and tried 4 times to change address. Pretty expensive issue 
I like the magazine for fashion as well as for the informative news articles 
GQ, A.K.A Gentlemen's Quarterly is a men's magazine like Cosmopolitan is to women. GQ has a broad range of contents in it's magazine from: in-depth articles from movie and rock stars, fashion, food and drink, technology, movies, music, etc. The magazine gives equal attention to all the contents except fashion which is more abundant throughout the magazines pages. All in all, GQ is a great men's magazine with plenty of fashion news/tips, and also delves in other men's interests as stated above 
If you're tired of seeing the baggy jeans, XXXL T-shirts, Nike sneakers, and trashy photos that degrade women then GQ is up your alley. The quintessential read for the sophisticated man, GQ never fails to impress me with their class for the everyday man. The magazine includes columns about news, entertainment, high class (not always meaning expensive, but suitably fit) fashion, and even features ficitonal stories from both up and coming to well established authors. If your a person who wants to dress and act like an all around well put together man, then GQ is the perfect read for you 
Finally a magazine that knows cottage. Cottage isn't country, although it can have some of those elements. It isn't necessarily small, but it can be. It doesn't necessarily mean old, though it can be. Country can be modern and hip or antique and traditional. Above all, it's casual and comfortable. It's a place you want to come home to. It's a feel, an ambiance, a flair for putting things together that don't come in room-to-go packages from furniture store decorators. I especially like the various styles presented in each issue -- ultra modern, traditional, log cabin, seaside, California contemporary, etc. and the monthly comparison of styles in one furniture grouping. It allows you to grab ideas from the entire spectrum of cottage style and to mix and match for yourself. I also like how easy the how-to advice is to follow. From paint advice to luscious gardens to interesting food, this magazine has it all. The accompanying website is great. Products and paints are easy to find. I've banished all the other decorating magazines from my subscription list 
This is my favorite home/decorating/architecture magazine of all time. Perhaps it is a fortuitous coincidence, but "Cottage Living" always features homes in areas of the country that are very interesting to me - like the Adirondacks, Boulder CO, Arlington VA, Asheville NC and New Orleans. The editors have a good understanding of cottage admirers and their interests. Therefore, they include floor plans, before after pictures, and brief back-stories that give us a glimpse into the life of the cottages and of their inhabitants. We get to see that cottages have very different characters based on their geographic region, their original purpose, and the style and socioeconomic standing of their owners. Some of the homes really stretch the definition of cottage because of their large size, but - usually - they convey the spirit of a snug informal home anyway. We see that cottage owners are very ingenious about using all of the interior space that is available. I love to see how people have used dormers, areas under a staircase, and other niches for things and activities that would otherwise not be practical because of limited square footage. A small space used wisely and attractively is a challenge that all cottage owners face. This magazine provides ideas galore. [The one thing that does puzzle and annoy me about the magazine is the presence of food articles. What about living in cottage - or wanting to - has anything to do with the type of food anyone wants to prepare? I see no connection at all. Furthermore, the recipes provided seem to be very labor and ingredient intensive. I'd rather have a few more pages about the houses!] Highly recommended!  
CEMETERY DANCE magazine is a World Fantasy Award winning magazine of horror, published bi-monthly, featuring short stories of horror and dark suspense, interviews with outstanding talent, and reviews galore. There is no shortage of opinions where products are concerned, with somewhere around forty-five reviews in every issue, including articles by writers Bev Vincent, Michael Marano, Thomas F. Monteleone, Paula Guran, Steve Vernon, John Pelan, Hank Wagner, Rick Kleffel, William P. Simmons, the list goes on and on. Writer Robert Morrish is the editor, Mindy Jarusek the managing editor. The publisher and executive editor is Richard Chizmar, who has edited and published some chilling anthologies under the titles SHIVERS I, II, III, and IV, featuring tales by top names in the genre, top names who know a thing or two about scaring people. CEMETERY DANCE magazine not only inspires "the creeps" in this reader, but also keeps me informed about new book releases, and other magazines in the genre. If you like your horror ranging anywhere from gonzo to literate, you will like CEMETERY DANCE magazine. 
Each issue piles on the terror. Don't read this late at night! What I truly enjoy is the variety of stories. It's not just for horror fans, folks. Some of these tales are suspenseful and others just leave you sitting there thinking, "What the f*%K? That did not just happen!" I have a lifetime subscription so I guess that means I'm takin' it to the grave.......and they'll still deliver!!! 
"Cemetary Dance" is a literary magazine devoted to the horror genre. It's not glossy, and except for the cover its pages are in black and white, but it is a good magazine nevertheless. Even though Amazon seems to think it is published 4 times a year, it is now published bi-monthly. So if interested in subscribing you'd better clarify that with them. Within its pages are original short stories by masters of horror such as King, Gorman, Little, Clegg, Straub, Lansdale, etc., as well as by lesser-known authors. There are also interviews, articles on all facets of the horror genre, and reviews of books, videos and software. There are ads for small horror presses and collectible editions. I recommend this as a must-read for horror fans 
What positives can one say about 'National Geographic' magazine that hasn't been said already. 'NG' is an American institution that appeals to individuals with a thirst for multi-culturalism, science, and sociology. And the photography is stunning to say the least. It is often said that 'the best education' is to travel far and wide and see how other cultures live and think. Since this isn't practical for many, the next best thing is to read 'National Geographic' magazine! In addition, the fairly recent cover article on 'Evolution' was well written, convincing, and accurate! And to the myopic, ignorant reviewer below who thinks that the world revolves around her, and who mentioned is not into Soccer, I say this to her: most of the world loves Soccer (technically called Football), and all the NFL, MLB, and NBA fans COMBINED don't even come close to the combined numbers of Soccer fans worldwide! I am a subscriber for life 
National Geographic Magazine is written primarily for theperson with little or no background in Geography. It is not an intense scholarly magazine and , as a Geograohy professor pointed out, tends to be chatty. But, it does give great information on geopgraphy as well as other fields in the Social Sciences even Natural History. There are many articles about people and places around the world and their customs. There are articles on the latest explorations and discoveries. Such as the rediscovery of the Gnostic Gospel of Judas and the oldest tatooed mummy.Zip USA takes a single US Zip Code and describes the customs and practices of the people living within that zip code. There are many interesting articles about people and places in the United States. I became interested in Geography and Anthropology through reading this magazine. The articles are quite informative and entertaining and the photography is outstanding 
Great Magazine, with in depth articles covering interesting topics around the globe. I pity the fool who does not subscribe to N 
This magazine is truly outstanding! It is very informative and only rarely makes mistakes! I love the indepth and informative articles that they provide. I also love the way that they always have such clear and beautiful pictures and there is no shortage of them either! I also love the fact that all of the articles are in line with mainstream science 
I've learned so much from this magazine. It takes you into cultures from all over the world and teaches you about them. Every month you're looking at pictures of events and people sometimes in places that you have never even heard of. Really educational and top notch 
I have always had a copy of National Geographic available to me. As a kid I glanced at my Dad's copy (just for the pictures- I had a subscription to Ranger Rick that was more my style until I was 8). As an adult I read it cover to cover every month and its the first magazine I look for on the newsstands. Simple the best magazine that is published 
Since I was a young girl I have poured over National Geographic photographs and some things never change. The stories now captivate me more as an adult and I appreciate that I have learned a lot about the world through the pages of this magazine that I might not ever had the opportunity about different cultures, places and events. After reading an article I sometimes have the feeling that I have been there. The articles are longer than most magazines, but I welcome the time I take to read an entire article from beginning to end (something that was more difficult when my daughter was younger) The inserts are an added bonus my favorite being the composite map of the world at night showing city lights and fires and such across the globe. Would I want to live with out National Geographic, no way 
This is the finest popular publication for classical music, and it is a wonderful complement to more serious publications such as Fanfare. Highly recommended for the collector, both amateur and serious alike. The CD that accompanies each issue is a marvelous addition. Inevitably I am exposed to new artists or performances on the CD that I wouldn't otherwise consider simply by reading the magazine. The combination of the magazine and CD is a great gift for young people as well. The CD exposes them to new music (and can be downloaded to their MP3 players!) while the glossy magazine gives them access to thoughtful insight and analysis. And yes, the magazine does have the ads from the major companies and their blockbuster stars. But I also enjoy reading the specialist ads and in so doing learn of new, unique music appearing on disc. 
This might sound strange at first, but I confess: Of course I subscribe to The Gramophone for its critically perceptive and unfailingly well-written reviews and features, but perhaps what I love best about this magazine are the copious and informative record-label advertisements! Just leafing through the Nov. or Dec. 2004 edition, I see full-page and even two-page spreads showing: * All the lastest issues in the Gramophone Awards series -- a series of mid-priced reissues by Universal (Philips, Decca, and DG) of recordings that have won a Gramophone Award. * All the latest issues in the Rosette Collection, another series of mid-priced reissues by Universal of recordings that have been awarded a rosette by the Penguin Guide. * All the latest releases by Hyperion, DG, Sony, RCA, Philips, EMI, Virgin, Naxos, Naive, Classics for Pleasure, BIS, Chandos, CPO, MD, etc. etc. etc. In other words, if you're a fairly assiduous collector trying to stay abreast of all the latest recordings, you will find The Gramophone invaluable and indeed unsurpassed in this respect -- both for new releases and reissues. And the ads not only give you catalog numbers and release dates; they also inform you which recordings have won which awards and garnered accolades from which critics. Browsing the ads in The Gramophone every month is *the* best way to see all the new releases -- not even the most well-stocked classical-specialist CD shop would carry all these titles. And what's more, many many desirable classical CDs are *never* issued domestically in North America, so how else are you going to find out about what's available in Europe? Furthermore, every issue contains a 4- or 5-page section called "New Releases," which lists very specific product info on every CD issued that month by over 100 record labels (!!) -- and that's no exaggeration because I actually counted them. New developments I've noticed since Gramophone's significant makeover in the Nov 2004 issue: Gone is Robert Layton (to BBC Music Magazine), apparently traded for Jeremy Nicholas (from BBC Music Magazine) -- these are new developments, aren't they? So it is no longer true to say that all three Penguin editors write for The Gramophone: with Layton gone, now only Greenfield and March do. (I will take this opportunity to say that I still miss Baroque critic nonpareil Nicholas Anderson. His moving from Gramophone to BBC Music Magazine is the reason I started reading that mag in the first place.) Finally, by way of rebutting the previous reviews on this page: As you can see from the above list of record labels that advertise in The Gramophone, it is no longer true (if indeed it ever was) that the magazine kowtows to the "major" labels. Fact is, The Gramophone's critics recommend as many or more recordings on such "indie" labels as Naive, Harmonia Mundi, Hyperion, Chandos, MD, CPO, Capriccio, Glossa, Linn, Avie, LSO Live, Telarc, etc. etc. as they do for the "major" labels: Sony, RCA, Warner, and Universal. And it is certainly *not* true that the next quality recording is more likely to emerge as an MP3 file from Russia than as a new release from a "major" record company -- and the reason for this is simple: The record labels -- all of them, including the indies -- have today's greatest artists under exclusive recording contracts. Until the likes of Vengerov, Perahia, Manze, Biondi, Minkowski, Harnoncourt, Jacobs, and a hundred others are free agents making their own recordings, the record labels will remain as relevant -- nay, indispensable -- as ever. And you won't find the VPO, BPO, Lahti SO, or Concertgebouw popping up on an obscure MP3 file either! And therefore, The Gramophone's "business model" -- earning revenue from record-label advertising -- is hardly obsolete. Quite the contrary, and moreover The Gramophone has been quick to embrace "indie" labels such as Harmonia Mundi (the mag's "Label of the Year" last year) and ventures such as the LSO and SFO issuing their own in-house recordings. In fact, the reviewer below who predicts the imminent demise of The Gramophone (and by extension all classical mags, including Fanfare, Diapason, and BBC Music Magazine) sounds much like the Gramophone-resenters at Classicstoday.com, who have been making the same claims for quite some time. Such resenters and their ilk have apparently never learned this simple lesson: You cannot build yourself up simply by tearing others down. (Attention Classicstoday.com: Want to earn some critical clout? Then learn to write, for crying out loud... Take Hurwitz, for example, who routinely exclaims: "This is the best recording of X or Y, period." Period? This is supposed to enlighten and persuade me? But pardon me, I rant and digress.) Finally, even if we assume for the sake of argument that The Gramophone and Fanfare offer the reader an equal amount of equally well-written reviews -- and I'm really not convinced this is true -- but assuming this to be so, I give the nod to The Gramophone for all of the above reasons. Fanfare doesn't offer the superabundance of information about the copious amount of new releases and reissues, and therefore isn't as useful a tool for staying current with *all* the new releases. And I must admit -- call me superficial if you will, but I must admit that Fanfare's lack of production values makes it relatively unappealing. In fact, based on its appearance and feel, it reminds me of a slightly larger-sized version of Reader's Digest. I freely admit that I love the tactile and visual qualities of The Gramophone -- the large glossy pages and photos and graphics and ads all make for very pleasurable perusal. By contrast, Fanfare can seem like an underground newsletter. I do believe that having more than one critical perspective is a good thing, and while I would certainly not discourage anyone from subscribing to Fanfare, I still think that The Gramophone is the obvious first choice 
Effective with the November, 2004 issue, Gramophone has undergone a number of changes in design and editorial content, all for the better. One of these changes, perhaps the most minor of all, is the reversion to its original title, 'The' Gramophone. The other changes are more substantial, hardly cosmetic, especially for North American readers. One of the more notable new features is an article devoted to "The Event" (great musical events in history). For my money, Gramophone could hardly have done better than to feature the September 12, 1910 premire performance of Gustav Mahler's 8th Symphony ("The Symphony of A Thousand," according to Emil Guttmann, the promoter engaged by Mahler for the premire). If I had just *one* performance to pick, were I able to turn the clock back, it would unquestionably have been this one. The anonymous writer has done a competent and reasonably accurate and complete job recapturing the excitement of an event which was talked about for decades afterward by those who were there. Another new feature is titled "The Experts' Expert," in which well-known musicians of today talk about their own historical favorites for their instrument(s). For the November, 2004 issue, several famous violinists (plus Lara St. John, who falls into a different category entirely) praise their personal heroes. While not unanimous, it is telling that Anne-Sophie Mutter, Sarah Chang, Julia Fischer and two others identify David Oistrakh as their personal inspiration. Still a third new feature, "Gramophone Classics," is a roundtable discussion of historic performances (one each month) by the Gramophone reviewers. For this kick-off month, the historic performance is that of the complete cycle of Dvorak symphonies by the late Istvn Kertsz and the London Symphony Orchestra. Now nearly forty years old, this is a boxed set of the cycle that I had favorably reviewed myself, quite some time back. (Interestingly, a nice photograph of Kertsz conducting the LSO shows that [at least] the principal flutist was playing a wooden flute, an advantage usually conceded to Czech musicians over their counterparts elsewhere in performing Dvorak's symphonies.) The balance of Gramophone, aside from minor cosmetic layout changes, is pretty much as it had been in recent years. There is the usual North American supplement/insert, covering events, performers and releases specific to this market; this is the version American subscribers receive and which is available in American book and magazine stores. The monthly reviews section is always of interest because it includes reviews of releases often available in the U.K. (and the continent) before they are available domestically. There is the obligatory "free" CD that includes excerpts from the Editors' Choice of Best Discs of the Month (something which I tend to ignore, if only because excerpts can only give an incomplete picture of matters). And, finally, always of interest to this semi-gearhead are the audio equipment reviews, if only to point out the differences between American and British gearheads. :-) The main purpose of such a publication is, of course, to provide critical commentary on new classical music releases. In this respect, I find the U.S.-published Fanfare to be a more reliable source of information than the U.K.-published Gramophone. Chalk it up to "across the pond" differences in both repertoire and opinion, if you like. Nevertheless, the improvements that take us from "Gramophone" to "The Gramophone" are enough for me to bump what might have been a 3-star review to one that is a solid 4 stars. Bob Zeidle 
to the defunct and much missed Armchair Detective magazine. Comparisons aside, Strand is the BEST of a large group that range from glossy to fanzines newsletters covering the mystery genre. VERY ENJOYABLE!! And don't sell some of them short either! John Row in1ea 
I recommend this magazine to writers and readers who love mystery stories. The stories are enjoyable. They have an old time flavor that I like immensely. The writer interviews have been some of the best I've ever read. I highly recommend this magazine 
My wife brought a copy of Strand home yesterday. The editorial and production quality look excellent. The personality interview, scholarly article and the short stories are very good. I plan to subscribe 
I don't know what planet that guy is from who is saying below that he had to wait a long time, if he bought a pair of glasses he would notice that you have to wait for 12-16 weeks for every magazine you order from Amazon. I had no problem with that-- I think the Strand is a unique magazine. With fiction by such great writers as Sir John Mortimer, Edward Marston, and great interview with actor Michael York. They also have fine articles one such article was about Hercule Poirot Agatha Christie. They are doing a great job 
I lean left politically and was looking for a magizine to inform and get me thinking. I tried several others, including The Nation, and settled on and subscribed to Mother Jones. While the magazine leans left, it does so in a more informed and intellectually honest way, as opposed to a rah rah banner waving way. It mixes in a bit more social commentary and investigation as opposed to political propoganda and endless articles on how to defeat the Republicans. If you're interested in a solid investigative, left leaning magazine, check out Mother Jones. Check out their web site, they have some free content and additional content that is available if you get the magazine 
This magazine confronts the most controversial and usually most important issues of our time. No mindless dribble through diversionary news (who won American Idol) in here, just the news that needs to be discussed. The issues corporate war mongers want to keep American's deaf to. 
It's a perfect magazine for people on the Left side of the aisle. It is a respectable magazine named for a respectable woman. It focuses on one subject though out the magazine and comes out each month 
Mother Jones is informing us about Trade Agreements and how we can save our jobs in the USA. When unions try to fight the corporations in order to get health benefits for their employees and not have to take cuts in their paychecks the company threatens to leave. Saying: "Like it or you won't have any jobs at all." This isn't Fair Trade, it is going for the "cheap labor" overseas. This magazine is getting the message out and I love it. They are exposing the truth about NAFTA and CAFTA. We all need more information like this so we can save the economic future of our country. If we do not, we the consumer, will not earn enough to pay for the items we buy. This means goods sit in warehouses, the company stock goes down and the stock market crashes like in 1929. We need to fix it now. Read this magazine. 
Like one commentor said..."The Truth Hurts". It does...If you're happy with your Martha Stewart and Scott Peterson news, do not buy this magazine. If you want the real dirt, left or right wing...this is it. They shoot from the hip. If you want the truth and not what you will see on the mainstream media, this is the magazine. They are well known to publish stories that the NY Times is afraid to publish. As a matter of fact, most of the writers on Mother Jones and The Nation used to write for the Times. And I just heard last week two stories written by NY Times writers that they're publishers wouldn't print. So guess who did? If you doubt me, look up the 25 Most Censored Stories of 2004 and 2005 
I just got the first issue in the subscription I sent for about a month ago. They were quick to send me my first issue. I had never heard of the magazine until they sent me a flyer highlighting what the publication was all about. I was intrigued the minute I opened the flyer, so I subscribed....blindly, I might add. The cost is right [$10] so I figured: *what the heck*! To me this is an interesting publication. Yes, it is journalism but it is refreshing and gets away from mainstream, *politically correct* gibberish. It takes a behind the scenes look, but doesn't go along with the *beat it into the ground* mentality that I get so sick of. I think it is honest and unbiased and almost reminds me of NPR [National Public Radio] reporting. You'll find a little of everything here. For instance, one of the articles in the issue I just received is another look at *The American Taliban* and his family, etc. I was amazed since we never heard anything more about the guy after they caught him. Very interesting article! They also had a story about a group of middle-aged Israeli women who monitor the actions of the soldiers in the West Bank...fascinating, humanistic story. I was completely intrigued by the story of William Zantzinger and Hattie Carroll and the song that Bob Dylan wrote about them back in 1963. Zantzinger, a white farmer, murdered Carroll, a black maid....and only served 6 months. He still lives in the same area. Wonderful story!!! Of course I ran to play the Dylan song afterward. All in all, the magazine is one I will look forward to every issue. A really pleasant surprise and a reminder to me that *you learn something new every day* is a motto to live by. I'll be subscribing for a long time 
If you are a liberal and enjoy well-thought out pieces on such various issues as Iraq to Azerbajin, this is the magazine for you. As I liberal, I look forward to every issue. Nearly every article is informative and interesting. Do not give this to a close-minded conservative. An open-minded one maybe. 
Excellent independent research! Investigative journalism at its best. It is neither a liberal nor a conservative publication, for neither Republicans nor Democrats are spared. Politicians make a lot of claims, and Mother Jones looks beyond their words to see if they actually put them into action. As you will see when you read Mother Jones, many politicians (both Democrats and Republicans) do not "put their money where their mouth is." Also, ignore the reviews saying that it is biased. Apparently, they consider facts that are inconvenient and run counter to their beliefs to be biased. What is interesting is that if they came across an article in Mother Jones that supported their beliefs, that they agreed with, then they would probably say that the article was impartial and fair. Hey, the truth hurts sometimes. Finally, the reviewers claiming that this is a liberal magazine because it talks about Bush so often are misguided. Mother Jones does so many articles on Bush because he makes so many claims and says so many things that are not supported by his actions. He is an easy target. They do articles on Kerry and others too. 
One of American evangelicalism's sympathetic critics once asked whether there is such a thing as a Christian mind. For all sorts of reasons - some more than justified - questioners, skeptics, and malnourished pilgrims have produced negative responses to the query. But perhaps things are better than all that. If encouragement ma be taken from BOOKS AND CULTURE: A CHRISTIAN REVIEW, there is hope for the kind of wide-ranging integration of faith and the intellect that is so routinely dismissed as implausible by the cynical, the misinformed and those who have yet to discover the intellectual renaissance among evangelicals that has populated university departments (philosophy and physics spring to mind as parade examples) with proponents of robust biblical faith. A publication of the Christianity Today empire, BOOKS AND CULTURE provides a forum for some of the most incisive writing and cutting-edge thinking to be found among Christians anywhere. One is not talking about puff pieces and cotton-candy testimony. Rather, the kind of thoughtful and self-critical engagement with the Great Conversation and myriad contemporary issues that one expects in the fat intellectual monthlies and the Reviews of the New York and London Times are on offer here, and in abundance. This reviewer - who fights his wife for possession issue and sometimes finds them tucked away in bedroom squirrel-holes of which she believes him to be ignorant - has watched this young-ish paper emerge as something of a renegade among evangelical organs and find its voice and stride within just a few years. Its trajectory has not been far from astonishing. CHRISTIAN CENTURY was once known for thought of this quality and still hits the occasional home run. If it cans sustain its current run, BOOKS AND CULTURE, looks rather to be the .325 hitter of which franchise glory is made 
I had heard of "Books Culture." I had never read it. And then a good friend from college called one afternoon and told me he was sending me a gift subscription. I've never enjoyed a periodical this much. It has given me hope. When George W. Bush was reelected the word "Evangelical" was spoken across the country in blame. Regardless of your political stance, the point is that the Evangelicals were seen as stupid enough to reelect what much of the rest of the nation saw as a poor president. Even today, "Evangelical" is often used to connote backwardness or stupidity. But "Books Culture" blows this assumption out of the water. Have you stumbled across another publication that will voice God-fearing perspectives on gender roles in the church, current philosophy and theology, current film and literature, politics, economics, and cultural phenomena such as the internet? This is "Books Culture's" most recent issue, thoughtfully done and honestly written, even when the conclusions reached seem somewhat outside of the traditional conception of things. As a subculture, we love answers. But it seems we are entering a new period of growth in our communities, one in which questions will be equally important and appropriately valued. Why not begin with the tough questions? You'll find many of them in "Books Culture." ALong P.S. Dennis, if you ever read this, thanks for the subscription, bud. 
One of my favorite magazines and one that deserves wider reading. I love the breadth of coverage ... history, current culture (though pretty much limited to American culture), politics, philosophy, science, film, music, theology and, of course, books! The reviews have gotten me to read quite a few books I otherwise would not have found. I also read First Things and do not agree that its coverage or authorship is broader, but in any case don't limit yourself to one or the other--take a look at both. You can of course access both through their web sites and see what kinds of articles are included in their issues. 
Esquire may be a man's magazine, but I enjoy the articles as a woman, because it is no holes barred feedback with the rough edges included. I got my first issue a couple weeks back, and found it funny, informative, great pic of Tom Petty, and I'm looking forward to more issues 
Esquire is a very good magazine with a talented staff of excellent writers and photographers. The magazine is designed to appeal to the more upscale, more highly educated man. Articles cover a wide range of topics, from fashion, to politics, to health, to food drink, to sports, to travel, to sex. Most of the articles are short, but you can count on finding a few lengthy pieces of journalism, and typically at least one interview with a well- known public figure.Esquire is printed on quality paper and with quality binding (no staples), and it has a very professional look to it. I enjoy the articles in Esquire. The writers are very good, with several of them using humor as the main ingredient of their journalism. Others are more serious. The writers provide a good level of balance and with so many different topics (cars, food, drink, politics, etc.) available in each issue to read, you can skip over those that are less appealing and concentrate on the ones that suit your interests 
Still maintains an excellent reputation as a top men's life style magazine. Articles are certainly for the more enlightened reader. But still manages to provide a good balance of light-heqarted fare. A must subscribe for the 'modern man' 
Magazine was fast to ship,filled with great advice on fashion,style and all of life's wisdom and wit all in one magazine 
This is the original. If you are looking for a man's magazine that is insightful, thought provoking, entertaining, and a great buy, look no further. Esquire has been around a long time and one of the reasons for its great success is that it has a certain 'feel' to it that transcends time. Yet it is right on the cutting edge of today's issues. Magazines like Maxim, Stuff, and FHM will never be in the class of Esquire because their appeal is strictly 'shock-value.' Basically if you have seen one of them, you've seen them all. They offer nothing new, and most of the content is pretty crass. Esquire, on the other hand entertains while making you think about a wide range of issues. There is always something in Esquire that makes you want to pick it up and actually read what's between the covers. Yet it still has its own unique style. The subscription price is huge bargain. You can't go wrong with it 
Esquire has gone through a lot of changes over the years. It went from a old style GQ clone to a magazine that has broadened its writing, reach, and content. Esquire now occupies a unique nitch in the world of men's magazines. It offers intelligent, thoughtful commentary on life, music, movies and celebrity, occasionally good fiction, good advice columns, a special but brief look at an extraordinary woman in each issue, and heartfelt stories on real issues that affect men, like an author detailing his battle with cancer. Another big bonus, Esquire is not oversaturated with advertisements when compared to GQ and other similar magazines. By comparison to some, Esquire is about 1/3 the size for the same content. Esquire also annually publishes the world's sexiest woman issue. Entertaining and well photographed, it sets Esquire apart because they also chose to celebrate the beauty of women in their 30s, 40s and 50s, rather than concentrate on the month's latest piece of starlet fluff. At under a dollar an issue, Esquire is one of the best deals in town, and is the perfect non-expensive gift for someone in your life Most magazine subscriptions end up costing you an arm and a leg, but this price is well worth the content.  
First off the best part of this magazine by far is the advertisements for those trips of a lifetime. The trips around the Mediterranean, the Pyramids etc always leave me daydreaming.... Ok maybe I'm exaggerating about the "best" part but when the ads are this good rest of the magazine has to be great! My photographer wife loves the Smithsonian as well and the photography awards a few issues back were STUNNING. Most winners of other photography contests in photography magazines always make you wander what the judges were smoking. You'll find something of interest in ever issue from astronomy to archeology along with beautiful photography. Plus the classifieds are full of ads for really cool items. But I already said that already. :)  
I have always loved this magazine and I am so glad I have it at home now 
There is never a dull moment with this magazine! You never know what the next story is going to be...just that it will be a great read! Really good photography and illustrations too! So if you are interested in what makes this world tick...check out Smithsonian Magazine 
I've been getting this magazine through Smithsonian for several years, so was delighted to see that I could get it cheaper through Amazon. (Smithsonian reminds me of Nat'l Geographic, which I also love.) My complaint in getting through Amazon, though, is that I could not stipulate when I wanted the subscription to start. My previous subscription just ended, so I do hope that it starts soon 
I have been an avid reader and supporter of Smithsonian magazine since I received my gift subscription in the early 70's. This is a cover to cover read every month and the museums are not to be missed if you have the opportunity to visit. They have rich collections for every interest, young and old 
Smithsonian is the magazine where I read about issues that wind up being newsmakers later. Really esoteric stuff. It's not flashy, or a quick read, or filled with funny, snarky content, so it sometimes is the last one I pick up (of my subscriptions)--it takes a little time and a quiet moment in the day. That said: this magazine has so much to recommend it. I really feel like I learn something each month when I read it. There is a good range of subjects in each issue--everything from articles on the environment to exploration to history to science. And then some. It really will educate you. If you care to be informed and continue learning, then I recommend Smithsonian. I also think it has gotten a little more interesting in the last five or so years. I would hate to have to live without Smithsonian, National Geographic, The New Yorker and The Atlantic. 
It seems almost sacriligeous to find fault with the TLS which for many is a kind of book-review Bible. But when compared to other book- review venues including the NY Times Bookreview and the NY Review of Books, I find it somehow chauvinistically British and narrowly focused. I also must admit to not liking the skimpy look of the journal. I base my remarks here not on one reading of one journal but on my general feeling after going through many many different editions of TLS over many years. Now I should qualify this by saying that there are of course many many outstanding reviews of outstanding books, and outstanding round- up surveys on special feature reviews. However when it comes to areas in which I have a degree of specialization, I usually find the taste of the reviewer so wide of mine that I end the reading with unease and dissatisfaction. 
Intelligently written, beautifully illustrated and designed, this magazine is a must-read for beginning book collectors and veterans. It should be of interest also to non-collectors or accidental collectors who just happen to love books. Great features on authors and genres will interest many; succinct departments will help novice and experienced bibliophiles 
If you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis, Forbes and Fortune are the two conventional choices. I started reading Fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when I realized that the business people with whom I associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages. It fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits. Fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends. You won't find anything radical here, but you need to have read it if this kind of news, analysis, and opinion fits your job description or personal interests. There is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson' in each edition. For me, the highlight is Stanley Bing's delicious, irreverent, and every so slightly jaded backpage column. I routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at Bing's corporate lunacy as I do. Fortune is behind the eponymous Fortune 500 and other derivative lists. For me, one of the most valuable is the magazine's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue', though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests. Other readers will tear out or access other Fortune lists online with equal interest. If you're in business or work with people who are, you'd better be reading Fortune or Forbes or both 
Detailed articles, and interesting columns. Balanced, and not afraid to be critical where appropriate. 
This is the best business and money magazine out there. They cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you didn't think of. 
Scientific American Mind shares all the fascinating news in brain/mind research in a realatively easy-to-understand writing sytle. The illustrations are excellent...lucid and colorful. 
I am a IT prof. Thus, I subscribed to this mag.; only with the perspective to gain a "little" insight into the working of the brain, instead of having to go through tons of myraid med. literature. What I was pleasantly surprised with and I really mean it - is this editorial board's ability to present even day-to-day matter which even "might" concern some neural science in such a lovely and beautiful manner; that even my wife (who's just a plain house-wife) loves to read. The subject matter discussed IN NO WAY can be considered to be MEDICAL, but rather a CRITICAL APPRECIATION AND DISCUSSION of every-day issues and stuff we notice around each each day. The amount of advertisement is bare minimum ; quality of print is excellent ; the writings are terrific. ONE OF THE BEST MAGAZINES TO HAVE on SHELF. (Proof - my sister's 16-yr. old came to visit me. She's BUILT on video-games, Skype/AOL chat and MS Civilization III. She opened this mag., started to read it and finished the 4 issues I had till midnight! 
This is my favorite magazine about the mind, particularly with respect to consciousness. It's like a meeting of the minds (no pun intended) between spiritual phenomena and scientific discovery. The articles are seriously interesting and always have a new twist. I do wish it was printed more frequently however it is worth the wait for each issue. 
This is the best magazine I've read lately. It is still new, and I've only received 4 issues, but read each cover to cover, finding each article fascinating, and very accessible (unlike the parent publication, which is occasionally over my head.) It may be just because I like the subject matter - but it seems to me these are subjects which would interest most people. Some recent articles (as of Oct. 2005) included why we lie, the meaning of dreams, the nature of consciousness, what causes creativitity, what is deja vu. It is one subscription which is well worth the money. The only drawback I've found is that it is quarterly - sometimes it seems like a long wait between issues 
This magazine has very good photos and cute stories that warm the heart. Very pleasant for dog lovers. 
This magazine has everything for a true dog lover. The articles are the highlight of the magazine. The magazine also features a list of breeders which I found very useful in finding my companion, Murphy the Maltese 
I subscribed to Everyday Food on a whim and am so glad I did. Fresh, seasonal recipes, also very well illustrated and documented recipes, not to mention easy! I subscribe to other "higher end" cooking magazines, but find myself always grabbing this one to sort through first. The recipes (typically) will not be complicated for most and will not require an ingredient that most Americans cannot find (which I find so refreshing!). If you are a novice or experienced chef, any home cook could benefit from this magazine. Now, if ya'll would excuse me, I have some cranberry scones in the oven (from this magazine, of course! 
This magazine has really blown me away. I wish there was some way to measure the amount of time it has saved me in the kitchen! I bought it at first because of the master shopping list in the front which allows me to stock up my pantry and freezer at the start of each month and then make smaller trips for each weeks' worth of food. I like the Have You Tried? feature which helps me introduce new foods to my husband and toddlers. I really like how the recipes are designed to use the same ingredient several times... I'm not left with 3/4 cup of some odd condiment which will sit in my fridge for a year and then get thrown out. I absolutely love the meal index; I check off each recipe as I make it which allows me to glance at the overall picture of our diet and see if I have given my family enough variety of different meats and vegetarian entrees. There are side dishes, after school snacks, breakfast ideas, a microwave recipe, a freezer recipe... they really have taken the time to cover all bases. In fact, in just a few short months it has gotten to the point where this magazine is all I cook from. My cookbooks are gathering dust :-) It has simplified my life to such an extent that when my mother called to see if I would bring a dessert to a family party, I grabbed the magazine and read her the list of 6 recipes. We picked one that would be easy to make and transport. It was a lot easier than brainstorming what to choose out of the hundreds of desserts one could possibly make. I like that the recipe is all on one page - I attach it to my range hood with a magnetic clip and everything is easy to read but out of the way, not getting food spilled on it. I also love the size which fits perfectly in my handbag and in a Ziploc bag once the month is over. I put the magazine pages for each issue in a bag with the index on top and when my husband asks about a recipe, I can easily glance at each one until I find the dish he wants. And I'll tell you another thing... many of the dishes contain salt and pepper and maybe one other spice. The food is light and fresh tasting and delicious. In fact, since I throw out my jarred spices after one year and replace them, my pantry shelf is down to just a handful because that's all that are called for in the magazine. This magazine has saved me a TON of money. Not to mention time! My kids are 3, 1 1/2 and 6 months and this magazine has been a lifesaver in every way. The cooking techniques are so easy that I can often prepare dinner with my oldest daughter, which she loves. And I love that I am in and out of the kitchen quickly (most recipes I have found are less than 30 minutes) and I am enjoying my time in there more than ever. In fact, I even have the energy most nights to clean up the kitchen after I'm done :-) I could go on and on but the most salient point is this: I feel healthier cooking from this magazine. My fridge is packed with produce like it never was before! I'm actually proud of the food I feed my family and that is worth every cent I've paid for this subscription and then some. 
As an author and food historian at www.CookingUpHistory.com I collect and read dozens of foodie magazines. This is a favorite because it pertains to how real people eat...meaning the kinds of foods we like to eat on a daily basis. Yet, there is enough variety of recipes and how-to's to keep it inetresting. Great as a gift for a host or hostess 
On a friends recomendation, I got a subscription to this magazine. I LOVE IT! I am always looking forward to new issues. When I first subscribed, I thought it would take a long time to get an issue. I received one within a month, and then another in a week. (they sent me the current, and then following issue) I was in heaven! I go through them all, and put sticky notes on the recipes that I like for easy access. This entire weeks dinners have come out of their menus. As for the Adobo Chili girl, it took me awhile to find them, but once I did I understood why they always use them. What a great flavor! A great magazine for someone that can cook, or someone that is kitchen inept. I have recently gotten a friend addicted that could burn a pot of water, and now she is using recipes and calling me all proud 
Well, if you read Rolling Stone and Spin (as well as Maxim's Blender), they both have one thing in common: Both are about image and pop culture as opposed to actual musical stuff. For awhile AP got way too trendy for me. However, this magazine is on track. Whereas many of the other magazines will only discuss things from artists that are real obvious "elitist" picks and heavy sellers, this album is for people who know of other great music. It's got a lot about goth/industrial/heavy stuff, as mentioned earlier. I have to respect them because they actually had a cool article on my favorite artist of all-time, VAST. They are interesting people who like interesting things. I imagine that I'll keep my subscription of this because it's from people who clearly know what they are doing. Even though they rarely update, Industrial Nation is recommended in addition to this wonderful magazine. I wish people would find that there is a lot of good stuff there that people aren't giving a chance at 
Outdoor Photographer is the essential how-to and where-to magazine for the outdoor photographer. I would recommend it for all levels of photographic skill, although most discussions of technique are suited to intermediate to advanced skill levels. There is only occasional discussion of the most basic techniques, as would benefit beginners. There are, however, so many great ideas on where and what to photograph that I think beginners can get a lot out of the magazine as well. And you won't be a beginner for long. The "outdoor" in the title does not refer exclusively to nature photography. Most of the magazine is dedicated to nature photography,but there are frequent articles on travel, location, and other sorts of outdoor photography, as well. In Outdoor Photographer you will find how-to articles on lighting, exposure, filters, gear, preparing yourself and your gear for the elements -be they arctic cold or rain forest heat and humidity, along with some advice specifically for digital cameras and the digital darkroom. And you will find this information for everything from close-up to landscape photography. Outdoor photographer focuses primarily on 35 mm and digital photography, with an occasional article on medium format. The discussions of exposure, lighting and locations are applicable to all formats of photography, however. And there is George Lepp's monthly question and answer column for those questions on just about any photographic or digital imaging subject that are not answered elsewhere. And now for the best part. Outdoor Photographer tells you where to get great outdoor photographs. "Favorite Places" is a one-page feature in every issue that tells you about a great place in the United States to photograph, what there is to see, and what time of the year is best. Be sure to save those in case you ever have the time and means to visit them all. In addition to "Favorite Places" there are featured articles in every issue that detail a place to photograph, how to get there, what to take, what to photograph, etc., frequently written by well-known nature photographers and accompanied by some of their terrific photographs. I counted 3 such articles in the last issue of OP that I received. If you are a photographer or hobbiest who is able to travel a lot, Outdoor Photographer is a terrific bargain just for the locations. And if you don't travel much, it will help you photograph your backyard and local parks and gardens well 
Why pay for it, when you can get a full year subscription for Maxim, FHM and Stuff magazines for Free! I got mine from this web site: stufffreesite.com/mensmag 
I tend to buy a lot of fashion and beauty magazines, and immensely enjoy reading them when I have time to relax and forget about my intense and demanding job. I do believe that InStyle is the best one, for me anyway. My favorite feature is the "Great at Any Age" where they discuss a clothing or beauty option and they present how it can look best on women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. I don't know of ANY other magazine that does that so well. I just canceled my Lucky subscription because I was so tired of seeing ONLY clothes that look great on 20 year olds. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against 20s, but a magazine needs to show a RANGE to be useful. InStyle magazine covers fashion and beauty very well, and is full of great tips and information for *everyone. 
This is the best fashion magazine on the market. Very realistic with budgets too. It shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable (on any budget). I also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful 
InStyle magazine takes its readers into the lives of celebrities and makes them accessible. The features are very informative and fun. I enjoy the Man of Style feature and the Entertaining guide best! For more on mags, visit my blog at magazinediva.typepad.com 
In my humble opinion, this is the best magazine for style and fashion advice. Even the advertisements are hip and informative, in terms of fashion and style. Of all the style magazines out there today, this is far and away the best of the best. 
InStyle is my favorite fashion magazine out there. It is much more reader-friendly than Vogue - much cleaner layout, the font is easier to read, and the writing is clear, witty, and less dry. I've been reading InStyle for about 3 years, and each issue never disappoints me. The focus of the magazine is definitely fashion, but there are also makeup tips and celebrity news. The magazine targets a much broader audience than more haute couture magazines like Vogue. My favorite section is "The Look" which highlights celebrity fashion and also has a section at the end that profiles a specific designer or label. InStyle also features many tips and recommendations on beauty products. The best issue of the year is without a doubt in March or April when they do "Best Beauty Buys." After polling beauty experts and testing hundreds of products, they feature the best beauty products in ever imaginable category. I've discovered some of my favorite beauty products through these issues, and it's nice to be able to trust a source without wasting your money on testing out expensive products that don't work for you. It is the best source for getting the most reliable products out there, from hair care products to makeup. I have seen several women at Sephora, clutching torn out pages from InStyle's Best Beauty Buys and frantically searching for the right mascara. I understand that Vogue is an institution now, but InStyle offers a much better alternative, and provides articles that you actually want to read and tips you actually use. 
I love InStyle. I can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of InStyle. It is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic, timeless fashion. It shows what is hot, how to put outfits together, who wears what, and it doesn't try to dabble in other areas. It sticks to fashion and I like that. That is why I subscribe to it and probably always will. The best out there. MUCH better than Elle and likely even better than Vogue. I love it 
We tried this for a short term, wondering if it would come on the day it was supposed to, so far so good, missed one day being on time, Snow Storm. My husband enjoys this paper, now he doesn't have to go to the store to get it and find out they are out, by noon he has todays issue. Very Pleased 
Scoffed at by journalism purists when it first came out, USA Today is great for what it is: a fast,colorful easy-to-read summary of national news.This is the trendsetter that changed the look of american newspapers 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS makes no apology for its antiquated typescript, large print, and generally stodgy appearance. It hardly needs to. It is simply one of the consistently finest sources of foreign policy discussion available from an American (thus *foreign* policy means USA vis-ï¿½-vis the world) point of view. The design folks have correctly discerned that toying with appearances could only interfere with a train that rolls just fine as it is. FA is often the vehicle of choice for American foreign policy officers who have moved on to think tanks and other private sector roles. For example, see the Richard Holbrooke (he of the Dayton Accords) piece entitled 'Liberalism and Foreign Policy' in the most recent (July/August 2006) issue available to this reviewer. The voice most often heard in FA is decidely that of the Washington establishment, broadly defined. Yet the editors occasionally toss in a dissenting viewpoint like that of Hugo Chï¿½vez' Ambassador to the US ('A Benign Revolution: In Defense of Hugo Chï¿½vez', July/August 2006) for color. The writing is well informed and superbly edited. Roundtable discussions on issues of concern are common, as are themed issues. Again from the recent issue, the topic 'The Rise of India' provides space for four essays entitled 'Unshackling the Economy', 'India's Global Strategy', 'America's New Partner?', and 'The Kashmir Conundrum'. FA's genius lies in that the globe's foreign policy experts will have digested these contributions with great care, yet the business traveler on her first trip to India can easily do the same on the first flight of her journey. Such is the quality of FA's editorial work. Long-time readers often discern an editorial drift to the right or the left, a perception that may owe as much to the changing currents of international affairs and the constantly moving matrix in which any statement must be written and read as to any real shift in the journal's political leanings. FOREIGN AFFAIRS is a must read for career internationalists, a worthwhile educational tool for those who want to know what America's brightest (thought not always most in touch with facts on the ground) policy makers are thinking, and a diversion for hobbyists whose curiosity regularly yanks them tornado-like out of Kansas 
This magazine is written by many of the most influential people in the realm of foreign policy. If one wishes to know what the Establishment thinks on foreign policy issues this is the magazine to read. But I have often found it to err in its judgment and evaluation of situations. A most recent example is a recent long analysis of U.S. - Iranian relations in which the experts led by Zbigniew Brezhinski posited that Iran would be open to conciliatory economic gestures to the U.S. in relation to its nuclear program. This analysis was so far of the mark , so naive, so uninformed as to what the Iraniians were saying to their own people publicly and in the mullah to mullah conferences that I was astonished it had been printed and taken seriously. Since that time of course the uncompromising determination of Iran to attain nuclear weapons, its fanatic Anti- American policy has become clear for all to see. So my advice is that whoever reads 'Foreign Policy' on any major world program would do well to read many other sources as well. i.e. the reader approach that by reading 'Foreign Policy' one now knows about the world is simplistic, and most often, wrong 
I've been reading FA since 2001 and have found it to be consistently good. There are only six issues each year, so I have time to read it front to back each time. The articles are more in-depth than something you might read in the Economist or other weekly news magazine. This is not something you read for headlines, but something you read for issues. FA seems to me to be non-partisan. Condi Rice, Chuck Hagel, and Donald Rumsfeld get space to write, but so does Madeline Albright and Samuel Berger. Recent articles I liked: "How to Counter WMD" by Ashton B. Carter, "How to Stop Nuclear Terror" by Graham Allison, and "The Outsourcing Bogeyman" by Daniel W. Drezner 
In the years I have taken this magazine, I have noted that often covered material becomes tomorrow's news from the latest hot-spot in the world. So prescient, it is eery - if you have any interest in current events, news or foreign affairs, this journal is a must read. The contributors are a Who's Who of politics, science and business in the world. Often the author list will become the under-secretary of state list in the next administration. For example, the last issue discussed Avian Flu virus. As a physician, I can tell you that these were excellent informative articles that explained clearly what was happening and what the danger was. And now this stuff is on TV every day and I can amaze my patients with how much I know about the issue that no one else does. Reading this will definitely make you look smart. Try this experiment and see if I'm right. This article is written in October 2005, days after receiving the October issue with multiple articles about China written by Chinese authors. Of course that means that these articles aren't really useful for facts so much as they are useful for seeing what China wants us to believe. I predict that China will be much more in the news in the next 6 to 12 months. So put this magazine to the test and see. One negative is that although the authors are bi-partisan regarding party, they are not "conservative". You won't ever find pro-tariff, anti illegal immigration, isolationist, anti judicial activism or pro-life articles in here. Indeed, regardless of which party an author supports, you can pretty much count on expanded government, especially one-world government presented as the solution. And lastly, some of the articles are deadly boring and contain stilted, obfuscated, diplomatic jargon. You will rarely find a simple, eloquent phrase, but you will often find ideas that will pop up in any analysis of the news. Just realize many of these authors are diplomats and politicians whose careers depend on obfuscation and plausible deniability. All in all, this is an extremely influential journal that is full of cutting-edge ideas. Just realize that many of them may be wrong 
 This is an excellent deep think magazine that is put out every two months with the best writers of Foreign Policy in the world writing articulate and current articles about the state of affairs of various countries, problem spots and emerging issues. Each issue contains fact full essays that give you an accurate state of affairs and makes you think globally about the situation in Iraq or any political hotspot. What are the long the term ramifications of our dealing with Iran, Russia and Venuzuela nationalizing oil etc.? If you don't know, this magazine's writers will give you the full view.   
I will give this publication five stars because it is one of the few magazines that has maintained its professional integrity without begging for a commercial outlook or seeking partisan funding. Foreign Affairs has so far offered the most relevant articles by the world's top experts and decision makers. For instance, Foreign Affairs was the first magazine to publish Samuel Huntington's article The Clash of Civilizations in the early 1990s. The article, which Huntington later developed and published in a book, proved to be one of the most controversial ones and provoked a debate that has been going on until the day these lines were written. The articles are more often than not comprehensive, simple and written by experts. This is not to say that all the published pieces are flawless. Yet, the articles are overall enlightening and a must-read for all those interested in world politics 
Over the last year, every issue of Foreign Affairs has been punctuated with significant essays from political and academic notables. The magazine also includes occasionally heated responses to previous essays and candid reviews of current books on international affairs. The publication frequently serves as a means for those aspiring to be in or recently pushed out of power in American government to express their views. Political figures such as Condeleeza Rice writing during the Clinton administration, former middle east envoy Dennis Ross (most recent issue), or Clinton National Security aid Strobe Talbot might fit into this category. Current executive or legislative eminences are much less frequent contributers - although Senator Chuck Hagel did provide a recent, but not especially enlightening, offering. There were a number of informative articles in the last two publications of the magazine. Each issue had one particularly worthwhile essay. For November/December Gal Luft and Anne Korin wrote about unarmed oil tankers, narrow, crowded and poorly guarded sea lanes and what steps terrorists may have already taken to position themselves to exploit these vulnerabilities. In the January/February issue Edward Luttwak presents the first persuasive argument I've seen for immediate disengagement from Iraq. He explains convincingly how a withdrawal coupled with extremely deft diplomacy might shift the burden of establishing a stable Iraqi government from the US to Iraq's neighbors and provide the added bonus of an improved US image in the Muslim world and continental Europe. Foreign Affairs is well worth the time of anyone who has an interest in becoming conversant with current political issues. 
The only magazine I read from cover to cover is Foreign Affairs, published by the distinguished bi-partisan Council on Foreign Relations. Ideas and issues presented in each issue are discussed six months later in the news. A recent example of this phenomenon is the publication of Daniel Yergin and Michael Stoppard's The Next Prize, about strategic issues surrounding the future of natural gas as an energy source. The article appeared in late 2003, and since then the concerns raised in the article have reverberated in business publications, energy conferences and Sunday talk shows.  Since my childhood I have thought of Foreign Affairs as an influential publication in leadership circles. Over a quarter century ago, I remember reading that Henry Kissinger promoted Daniel Patrick Moynihan as US Ambassador to the United Nations on the basis of an article he wrote in Foreign Affairs. As the founder of a company dedicated to cultural and business travel to Russia, I need to stay ahead of the knowledge curve with regards to the world, rather than just be informed of events. I find Foreign Affairs to be the single most valuable tool to stay informed about foreign policy, trends in world affairs, and current political thought. 
A must-have for all info junkies. From the bizarre to the informative, the diligent crew at mental_floss never ceases to dredge up something interesting. Be the life of the cocktail party, be a mental_flosser 
This is truly one of my favorite magazines! It's been a favorite gift for friends and I know that it is being passed to others so each issue gets multiple readings. Of course, my issues are safely in my home library since some things are too good to share 
I've been subscribing to mental_floss for about two years now, and still read every issue from cover to cover the same day it arrives. It's fun and light-hearted without being stupid, and touches on a wide range of topics. I've given several gift subscriptions, and most of the recipients liked it so much that they've renewed their subscriptions on their own 
MENTAL FLOSS provides some of the wittiest, entertaining, and might I say even thought provoking reading available today! It's a great way to start the day or to take a break from work, life, stress, dissertation writing, etc! When you need to laugh or go just "hmmmmmmmmmm...that's interesting", pick up MENTAL FLOSS 
I've been reading this magazine for years. It never fails to entertain me while it teaches me fascinating new things. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to feel smart again 
MAC WORLD HAS BECOME TOO COSTLY. MAC ADDICT IS ECONOMICAL AND PROVIDES ALL THE CURRENT INFO I REQUIRE. GOOD REVIEWS AND PLEASANT FORMA 
If you read some of the older reviews some make the comment that Mac Addict isn't what it used to be. I'm not sure what they're getting at with that. This magazine has been steadily improving over the years. Lots of reviews, and the included CD is a great tool, filled with free ware, share ware, and samples of commercial software that allow you to try the program before buying it. If your a Mac engineer it may not be enough for you, but for most of us this is a good source of info 
I have been subscribed for little over a year now (no discs on my magazines though - they must have phased this out). I look forward to the day my Mac Addict arrives as it is always full of great tips to make life easier. A must have for anyone who owns a Mac, this magazine contains useful tips, troubleshooting, guides to free downloads, and loads of tech support. I especially love the Q section, and find that this part is the most useful to my day to day computing needs. I have just renewed my subscription for another year 
Whether you are a technical guru or someone who's emphasis is on the words, any serious filmmaker who takes his or her craft seriously will love American Cinematographer. The official magazine of the American Society of Cinematographers, this magazine gives you in depth interviews with DPs and Directors on the technical approach towards the shooting of the picture. They cover not just lab soups and lighting techniques, but also the approach to the script, design notes on how to visually approach the script - in other words, a great detailed overview of how this particular crew of filmmakers went about creating the visual language of the film. And not just film - as technology advances, and more films are shot on video, this magazine gives the same great coverage to those pictures as well - from Star Wars to Anniversary Party. While it's true that there are only so many films that AC can cover each issue but I think you'll end up feeling like I do - that I wish they could cover them all 
"Better Homes and Gardens" has been a staple in our home for years. This essential magazine seems to always be there for you. When I think about it I would say that it has enriched our home and ultimately our lives. Its very visual style of lending ideas for enhancing our domicile and our surroundings has always been simple yet effectual in enriching our lives 
This is the only music magazine you ever need to read. This is what Rolling Stone should aspire to be. There is really nothing more to say than if you like music this is all there is 
I am a big fan of this magazine, but even more so of the "free" cd--when it is good, it is very good. So I finally subscribed despite the stiff price. Two issues came, I was happy, then a third without the cd, and then...no more. After many calls and complaints, Amazon finally secured a partial refund--not exactly what I wanted. Here's hoping that the delivery problems can be worked out--maybe an opaque wrapper 
As far is the writing is concerned this is a top notch rock magazine. The format is appealing and the pages are not marred by one too many ads. Another plus is the CD that comes with each issue ; this might help justify the cost. The original CD's are priceless with real gems that the average music listener may not have heard of. They choose a theme and run with it, creating an eclectic mix of artists to illustrate their theme.Take for example a few months back when it was legendary tracks from Studio One in Jaimaca where it featured little known artists among reggae afficionados like Ernest Ranglin, Michigan and Smiley next to giants like Bob Marley, The Skatalites for a complete view of the important record label of reggae. I really enjoy the monthly features including tributes to those that passed away in the month entitled "Real Gone." Old rock stars are going faster than they did in the seventies! Other good features are the brief reviews of music indexed as Filter reissues, reissues extra, tracks,buried treasure an just plain Filter Albums(current stuff). The in depth articles of the cover subject are very entertaining and what actually drew me to Mojo intially for information. There is one draw back for US subsrcibers, it is a long way acros the pond and problems will occurr. In the last year my problems have been as follows: was receiving my issues two weeks after the stores had copies, missing CD's. To their credit both problems were solved in spite of having to send three issues so that I would finally get my ripped off CD, it was stole twice! Subscriber beware. Sending it in clear plastic with the words CD inside is just an invitation to a thief. Otherwise it is maybe the best rock music magazine out there and I defintely recommend the Brits perspective 
Since its fisrt issue in 1994, Mojo magazine is THE SOURCE for all things rock and roll. What I love most about this magazine is that they do ridiculously exaustive articles on semi-obscure but important groups of past and present. Where else would you read a 19 page story about the making of Ogden's Nut Gone Flake, or the cultural importance of the Purple Rain soundtrack? The writing in this magazine is so great that they can make a synopsis of the son of Ringo Starr's musical career be the most interesting thing you've ever read. The British music journalism market is as cutthroat as it gets, and only the best publications survive. My biggest concern is that after more than 10 years of such writing that subject matter become a shortage to where they begin recycle articles from past issues because they ran out of bands to write about. That is to say it is not totally without flaw. British music magazines have this awful habit of putting together these 'best albums ever made' lists every two years with questionable entries. Sorry, but calling Kula Shaker the 27th best band of all time in 1997 is just stupid. Also, since this is imported from the UK (would it really but their balls to have a US publishing outlet like a majority of magazines out there?) you not only pay a hefty price for it, it is hit or miss that you end up with the included CD that comes with it. 
If you are one whose definition of rock music is fairly elastic and whose taste in rock music is eclectic, then I recommend Mojo Magazine to you. I haven't read all magazines relating to music of course, but of those I have, Mojo does the best job covering the music scene today. Its approach is fresh and its appeal wide. Unlike some of the other music mags around, it is one that the whole family can read and probably find something musically meaningful to each. Its writers, whose taste in music is broad, approach music without allowing personal prejudices to color their articles. They can find as much merit in a new Nick Cave CD as they do in a new Bert Bacharach effort, if the music is worthwhile and they do it without gushing. A recent issue highlighted Bob Dylan, Marianne Faithfull, and Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols each of which certainly appeal to different audiences. The thing I like best about Mojo is that each issue comes with a CD featuring various artists doing whatever type of music that is the focus of the month's lead article. The CD really adds value and has me anticipating the next one. I never thought I'd like the Sex Pistols, but when I heard the feature CD of songs that influenced them, I understood their music a lot better. You might get a better deal on the magazine than is offered here if you go to the bookstore, find the magazine, and look for an insert bearing a special offer. That's what I did. Whatever way you decide to try the magazine is up to you, but I'd be surprised if you didn't find it informative, enjoyable, and money well spent 
MOJO magazine is simply the best reading a music lover can get their hands on in the 21st century ! It covers rock and roll ,and all its off shoots, from back when "ROCK" meant everything to its early fans ; recommended for those of us with an English rock music addiction : The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Hendrix ,The Who,Yardbirds ,Pretty Things, Genesis, Hawkwind ,Motorhead, Nick Drake, Fairport Convention, etc.Usually available at Borders and Barnes Noble the 15th of each month. Howard D. White, collector 
My head pulsates with useless music trivia and knowledge, most it from reading magazines like "Mojo." Let's face it - the Brits have the market cornered on quality music-centric publications right now with this one, "Classic Rock," "Q," and, occasionally, "Uncut," - but "Mojo's" editors need to get over their obsessive compulsive infatuation with The Beatles and Bob Dylan, both of whom's influence and importance in the grand scheme of rock and roll's lore has been grossly overrated. Live with it (and let the hate mail start rolling)! That minor caveat out of the way, "Mojo's" writing is the essence of drive, simplicity, and reverence for its subject matter (two words - Ben Edmonds), no small feat. Their feature articles are loaded with facts and information even I've never read before and the layout is spot-on brilliant. And how's this for innovation? The reviews section skimps on neither quantity nor quality. While I can't pretend to automatically snap up each issue of "Mojo" like I do with "Classic Rock," I'm usually on the latest issue at my newstand like dirt on a dog, as evidenced by the stack of back issues at Casa Paull which now towers above all three of my kids. And if all of this isn't enough, most issues come with a free sampler CD of tunes at least marginally related to the cover story - that's called "gravy." Oh yeah, I almost forgot. It's not half-full of ads, like "Rolling Stone." Highly recommended. 
If you are a fan of a certain genre of music,be it mainstream pop, punk or hip-hop, there are at least a few magazines to cater to your taste. The rarity is a magazine that caters to the all-around pop music fanatic, and Mojo Magazine tops that obscure list. This is a pricey publication, but well worth the money. Since discovering the magazine several years ago, I have been amazed at the diversity in the cover features alone: The Beatles, ABBA, Frank Zappa, Kate Bush, The White Stripes, Michael Jackson, Rolling Stones, Sex Pistols, Madonna... there is something for everybody's taste, and plenty for people with a wide range of musical taste. Cover features inside, I am always amazed at the space they give to performers and/or bands that have a small cult following. I especially enjoyed the piece they did on The Incredible String Band several years back. As they usually do when covering a group's history, the Mojo writers do not shy away from the friction and low points involved in the band's career. No tabloid trash-talking or finger pointing, just good solid journalism; showing the strengths that makes an icon's popularity endure, and the bumps in the road that ended the ride. The reviews of CDs are plenty, and I often find myself discovering something new to add to my collection. You'll find reviews of pop, punk, folk, blues, country, classic rock, you name it! I also find the reviewers to be a lot more open minded when reviewing albums, which is a welcome holiday from the plethora of snobbish music critics who go out of their way to trash good efforts. Mojo, in my humble opinion, is top of the music mags. If you are an over all pop-culture fan like I am, and are always on the lookout for something new to add to your collection, then Mojo Magazine should be a key resource in your database! 
As an aspring graphic designer who is addicted to fashion, I have found this magazine to fulfill my needs. It's not the type of magazine that going to tell you which bathing suit works well for your "bum type." They are not interested in what the tabloids say about their featured actor/actress/model or whoever. It's more about having an slightly in-depth conversation. This is a magazine appropriate for those we a refined sense of fashion, satricial writing, feature writing and the many ebbs and flows of fashion "trends." Cosmopolitan as to can of Bud Light. W...savory this one with a glass of champagne. In the vary least a merlot 
W makes it clear what industry it serves, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to read and look at. It does have some interesting insight into the fashion business, such as a column on deals, mergers, CEO's, designers, new talent; plus there are photos from the runways in New York, Paris, and Milan. You can really see a designer's theme and imagination, and that is an art of a sort! The party photos are fun to see, because you can do your own "what not to wear" with some of the women pictured, who are trying as pathetically hard as we are in the sticks to make the most of what we've got. Interestingly, the articles usually do not gush over their celebrity topics (except Reese Witherspoon, and what's not to like?). There can be quite a tone of sarcasm when the subject warrants it. Of course, the product articles are pitched to sell the product, but you can still glean some hard information. And last but not least, the fashion photography can be compelling. Sometimes you're compelled to say "this is stupid" but you're compelled to look. One thing about W that keeps me subscribing: the prose may not be deathless, but it isn't breathless. (Pay attention, fashion editors 
I love W magazine in all its oversized glory. Its frothy with articles for the affluent, gorgeous photography, celebrity interviews and other frothy delights. It aims for the affluent and its unabashed in doing so. Its amusing that certain people review on Amazon.com with their personal rants that have nothing to do with the product at all. If anyone works hard for their success then why should they be abashed for enjoying the good life and beautiful things? Its these people that W addresses, and its frothy and I'm going to enjoy it for all its frothiness 
this is a riot get the W it rocks! and email this to mom .my sister sent it to me 
What do fine dining, high fashion, celebrities, beauty tips, travel, exceptional photography, and entertainment all have in common? They can be found in W magazine. A magazine of women's interests, W is a huge publication measuring approximately 9" X 13". Which is one reason I like it, it's like getting a magazine from the 1940's with 21st century fashions. I would put it in the same category as Vogue. Anyone will love viewing W., but it's not hard to figure out who it's mainly aimed at, especially when you occasionally see jewelry priced between $20,000 and $200,000, and when you notice who some of the advertisers are, namely Prada, Calvin Klein, and Armani.W also has superb photography, photography that borders on Art. I have a subscription and share it with family and friends, then place it in my collection( I collect magazines ). If you like magazines such as Vogue and Harper's Bizarre, you are sure to love this fine publication 
Bought this as a girft for my mother, and she loves reading them. Must be really good 
I have or had aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents strewn all throughout the South. My dad is from Texas. For a New Englander like me that has always been quite a dichotomy. I have traveled and spent time in all 13 Southern states. Ever since grade school we were taught there were 13 Southern states based on those states that seceded from the Union during the Civil War. I am not sure what exactly constitutes Southern State theses days! I have always liked Southern Living Magazine. It is a quality publication. I enjoy the Homes and Foods sections and often refer to the Travel sections when making a Southern trek. I finally got to see Savannah proper last spring and I was quite impressed. Some things stand still over time and Savannah has many squared off sections of park that bring you back. I also referred to Southern Living magazine on several trips down to Arlington, Virginia especially for checking out some food ideas. Some of this magazine brings me back and evokes images of the old south yet it certainly remains current on what is going on and what is fashionable now. If you enjoy the South, have roots there or just plain out feel some affinity to our national heritage from this region of the country, this magazine is highly recommended. I truly have a fond place in my heart for this magazine. As for my family, I have relatives in Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina. 
So, you want to know where to stay, what to see, what to eat, how to get there, when to come, and who's who in the old South??? Look no further than the pages of "Southern Living," a superb look at everything new and old about the region. With great photographs and accompanying text, the magazine is a must-have from visitors and residents alike. There's no place like the South and the magazine recognizes this fact and proudly displays its best 
My mother-in-law, knowing how much I love to cook, decided to order me a subscription to Southern Living as a Christmas present last year. I'd flipped through issues before and even purchased some of their cookbooks in the past. Also my mother has a collection of her own. I was surprised to find a consistency of quality once the magazine started coming to the house regularly. The recipes are always well organized and easy to follow. Many of them are quite easy to make, with only a few requiring some cooking expertise. Granted I like a little higher level from time to time, but there methods are great for beginners and even some recipes for kids find their way in. Beyond that, I really didn't care much about the rest of the magazine, but curiosity drove me to read through them thoroughly once I was done with the food section. What a marvel of decorating ideas and home rennovations as well! The entire magazine is filled with tips and ideas for how to add that little southern flair into your everyday lifestyle. It's everything from Florida to Virginia, Tennessee to Texas. Even if you live in the north, mid-west or pacific coast, there are a myriad of great and helpful ways to improve your homestead. This is a wonderful catch-all magazine, great pictures, informative articles and useful recipes. I like to make up a couple of the dishes and surprise my friends and family. As always, feel free to use the recipes as a guide and add your own ingredients to the mix. That's one of my favorite ways to cook them! Truly a must-own for anyone who is thinking of adding some spice and sass to their househould 
This was an easy way to activate a subscription and at a better rat 
I like this magazine and appreciate the subjects covered in the articles. The technology updates and reviews are informative. I always learn something new after reading it and that makes it worth it to me 
The first copy of the magazine my wife received was a two month old copy of the magazine when the current magazine issue was on the newstand, the second issue came on time but the third issue has yet to arrive as the current issue has been sitting on the magazine shelf for weeks. The distribution of this very good product is very inconsistent.... maybe I can cancel my subscription and take a money lost and get this superior magazine from the magazine store 
I received my subscription in a timely manner and received backdated issues, also. I am very happy with the magazine 
About two years ago, I became a subscriber to Shape, mainly because I had received it for free as part of a package deal with another magazine. I had always liked browsing through issues of Shape in the supermarket, and I thought that being a subscriber would help support my fitness goals. Overall, I have enjoyed Shape and found it to be useful, but there definitely are some negatives, and the magazine might not be for everyone. But first the good. Like many others have mentioned, what I most enjoy about Shape is their real-life weight stories featuring a nice variety of women, some of whom actually needed to *gain* weight in order to be healthy. I also love their relatively new feature in which they follow one of their own staffers on a year-long weight loss journey. Many of their other regular features are also excellent, particularly the body part-focused strength exercises and other how-to exercise guides. And I especially like that Shape uses "Reader Models" with so many of their articles--real life women of various ages (although admittedly, mostly in the 25-35 range) with normal, healthy, strong bodies. Finally, their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations on traditional exercises, and the recipes are often quite good as well. The main negative has already been brought up by many others here: the use of too-skinny, not overtly fit or strong models to illustrate much of the magazine. I find this extremely disappointing; I understand that to sell magazines, the models probably have to conform to some traditional standards of attractiveness, but those of us buying the magazine want to see women who are not only fit but also strong--show us some muscles now and then! As I said above, the reader models are great; the women are usually quite fit, but they have muscles and curves too, which is wonderful to see. Shape MAY be trying to make some improvements in this area, as the last few covers have featured famous women who do exercise (such as Denise Richards), but they still have a long way to go. And while they're at it, I hope they will return to having their cover models dress in fitness wear, not bathing suits! They can still show off their model's physique AND showcase cute fitness wear at the same time. Similarly, I would like to see the magazine get rid of the fashion segment at the end *unless* they start focusing it on exercise clothing, not haute couture. If you are overweight and/or new to exercising, you may find the magazine discouraging, but if you can get past some of the negatives, it can also be inspiring. I think it's up to each individual to determine whether a magazine like this is likely to hurt or help her fitness efforts; for me, it is helpful, but this definitely might not be the case with everyone 
I read the other reviews, and I have to agree that this magazine isn't entirely fitness, but that's what I like about it. I'm just starting to adopt a healthier lifestyle and this magazine has great articles on new exercises, interesting recipes, and cool beauty tips that are geared more towards natural remedies. Anyone who is working out regularly has the habit of feeling bored after awhile. Getting this magazine once a month boosts my excitment about making myself healthier and gets my butt back in the gym. My favorite feature of this month was a new stationary bike routine, complete with interval times, resistance levels, and an MP3 playlist to correspond with the tempo of the workout!! Great idea. 
Those arriving at this Amazon page doubtless have some interest in books. In reading the reviews I note some disappointment with the contents of the London Review. Maybe if I provide a brief summary of one issue you can decide whether or not this is the book mazazine for you. About fifty percent of the contributors to a current issue are PhD academics. Here is a sampling of the articles in this issue: 1. Writers, Readers, and Reputations: Literary Life in Britain 1870 to 1918. 2. A University of Chicago philosophy professor explores philosopher Alisdair McIntyre's conceps of truth and ethics as found in the recently released 2 volumes of McIntyres essays. 3. A review of Kostal's book "A Jurisprudence of Power:Victorian Empire and the Rule of Law". You like fiction? In this issue you'll find reviews of the books of novelists Edward St. Aubyn, and M.J. Hyland. There is also an article about the German author Gunter Grass who reveals in a book that he was a member of the Waffen SS during WWII. Unfamiliar authors? For me too. Next month though they will be reviewing American author Richard Ford's new novel. Now him I know. Rather than write a review of glowing praise or bleak condemnation I thought it best to simply tell you what's in it, and let you make up your own mind if this is the kind of book magazine you would like to read. Like the New York Review of Books you'll find a variety of articles that aren't about a book at all, and some books that are reviewed merely serve as a Hitchockian mcguffin for the reviewer to expand at length his opinions about the subject of the book. I suppose a hierarchy of book magazines in terms of sophistication might be Bookmarks for the everyday fiction reader (It's a good magazine, in my opinion), and then, a step above, the New York Times Review, on up to the New York Review of Books, and then at the top the London Review of Books. Mind you I am not categorizing these mags in terms of the quality of writing. They all are good. It's just that if you want to be able to enjoy all of the London Review's article it might help if you were a polymath. 
Dog Fancy is an excellent magazine for all parents of the furry four-legged tail waggin' love bugs out there. It is very informative and I, myself, refer to previous magazines all the time. It's your own personal library full of information that you can use now and even in the future. I've subscribed to Dog Fancy and Dog World. Dog World is for parents who are mainly in dog shows and agility. While Dog Fancy is for the average parent who is not in the sports realm. I love Dog Fancy magazine and I know that parents who love their "kids" as much as I love mine, will enjoy this magazine as much as I do. 
My mom used to subscribe to this magazine when I was growing up. I used to read it often throughout my adolesence. However I always found the magazine to be lacking. (Quality, Information.) Now some 10 years later I decided to try the magazine out once again. Since there has been some recent hype going around about it. I got this months newsstand -- April -- issue and the Special Puppy issue. I am in Love! It seems the Dog Fancy has improved by leaps and bounds since my last read. Now it contains an enormous ammount of extremely helpful information as well as stories and such to entertain you 
I have read Dog Fancy for a year now and I find it to be full of useful information for people that have a dog or thinking about getting a dog. The only problem that I have with it is, that sometimes a whole issue may be designed around a topic that you are not interested in, so the whole issue is of no use to you 
i have more animals than I know, I love best my gang of dogs, and this mag. has it all products, reviews, vet info, wonderful storie 
I subscribe to Entertainment Weekly, Premiere, and any magazine with a photo of Johnny Depp or hobbits on the cover, but Scr(i)pt is my favorite magazine. Every issue of Scr(i)pt has articles by the screenwriters of movies that are just opening, explaining something about how the movie was written and featuring excerpts from the screennplay of that movie. These are triply helpful, as they (1) provide insight into how a successful screenwriter works his craft, (2) supply brief examples of what the movie you just saw (or are about to see) looks like on the page, and (3) are a useful tool in deciding which movie to go see Saturday night. Each issue also has articles of the more general How To... variety, although these range from How To Write Great Scenes/Characters to How To Pitch To Studios to Why Studio Execs Are Using Your Script To Wrap Fish. For a while there was a series of articles that were simply a compilation of all the genre cliches, written in the hopes that if you knew what they were you could avoid them; they were invariably hilarious. These How To/Writing Advice articles are often extremely funny (this is not meant as an insult--they are meant to be funny as well as helpful). Finally, every issue has the news on sales, contest winners, and whatnot that is essential for any working screenwriter, with a generous helping of heartwarming success stories to keep your spirits up while you're waiting to hear from the studios. I highly recommend this magazine. Enjoy 
I was drawn to this publication by the haunting image of Shep (from Blue Peter) calling me to read more. I dunno how close John Leslie and Shep were, but you can read a very probing(!) interview, which examines the closeness of the relationship and how such a lovely fluffy animal can become part of the family, like an aunt or uncle 
I think this is one of the better dog magazines out there. The articles are varied, informative and well-researched 
The coverage always seems nice and varied -- there are the elaborate, "took me a week to prepare" meals alongside the quick throw-together meals, and helpful side notes about products and ingredients. I also like the tangential coverage for dining out, wine, and travel (to good food places! 
A friend of mine used to subscribe to Bon Appetit and flipping through the magazine I found so many interesting recipes. 
This was a very good price for a very good magazine. I saved $3 - $5 over the normal subscription rate 
I greatly enjoyed reading this magazine in years past. However, I have not received anything yet from my Amazon.com order. I am eagerly waiting for my subscription to start!! 
The New York Times Book Review is designed for an archetypal NYTimes Reader: a person with a solid liberal-arts education with moderate-to-liberal political views who is eager to appear up-to-date with contemporary literature - serious fiction, popular biographies and non-fiction in the social sciences. Popular fiction, serious science and other subjects are usually omitted not by design but because of space constranits, I believe. That said, most reviews seem to be thorough, fair and educational in themselves, although occasionally you will note that a reviewer may have a significant, important bias concerning the author s/he is reviewing. Some times this isn't revealed and leads to weeks of debate in the letters column. In recent years more attention has been paid to so-called children's literature, which is helpful. The fiction best-seller lists are almost meaningless anymore, as they are crammed with thrillers and romances almost of the drug-store variety, but the non-fiction best-seller lists can be a way to find something new. There are few specialty columns (or any columns at all, come to think of it), but the venerable Marilyn Stasio has done an excellent job of covering the huge mystery field and keeping readers up to date on their old favorites as well as promising newcomers. The Times' book world tends to be occupied by authors who have already passed an invisible acid test of acceptability. You'll have to seek out truly new voices in less traditional publications. That said, the Times Book Review keeps you up-to-date on all of the important books and provides additional sustenance for the average, well-educated reader of somewhat broad tastes 
I really love this magazine because it not only shows great new products, it also reminds you of old faves. Lucky keeps you up on the trends but also gives you tips for the classics. I've gotten this subscription for my shoppin' loving girlfriends. Makes a great, "indulgent" gift that keeps giving all year long. 
Lucky is a great magazine to look at and then look at again. It usually takes me a couple of hours to look at all the fashions. I have discovered some great fashion websites because of the magazine but other than that I can't say I can actually go out and buy anything they feature. Even the up and coming designers are out of my price range. They used to feature affordable fashions but now they seem to have fallen in love with the name brand or boutique stuff. Plus, can we please have these New York magazines stop talking about H M. There is no H M stores where I live. So stop toying with me 
The right audience is the grunt in the trenches of today's commercial coding. You've got to deal all the weirdness of Java, C++, a dozen different web technologies all calling themselves THE technology, and lots more. This magazine gives you plenty of ammunition for those tactical assaults on performance, STL, exception handling, networking, and all the other foes you face daily, with plenty of source samples. This is not for anyone looking beyond today's technologies, to the next one or the one after. It's not for someone newly bumped up to project lead, who is barely dog-paddling in the deep end of planning, scheduling, and strategy. It's not for readers who want industry news much beyond the Wintel world, or the details needed to create the most complex systems instead of simply using them. These readers may find bits of help, but they're not the patients that Dr. Dobbs intends to treat. Pick it up at your news-stand and thumb through a few issues. You'll know in a hurry whether this addresses your interests. If it does, it can give you real boost as an implementor. It's not for all readers, though. //wiredweir 
American PHOTO has an indepth look at alot of various subjects. There are some photos of real life situations experiences. The latest issue depicted the Iraq war situation, how some of the soldiers Iraqi civilians are coping with what's going on around them. The magazine also has alot more close-up detailed photo's, so even the amateur photographer can enjoy it. I have been a subscriber to American PHOTO for many years probably will continue to subscribe for as long as the magazine is in existence, or the rest of my life, whichever comes first. I collect each every issue. I love America PHOTO!!!! 
American Photo is a much better magazine than its sibling Popular Photography, but frankly, that is not saying much. It seems as though its primary market is fashion/glamour photographers since most of its issues are devoted to these aspects of professional photography. There are other magazines which excel at nature photography, so I am not disappointed by its absence here, but not noting more fine art documentary photograhy is a major omission which I hope this magazine does address eventually. There are also excellent photo equipment reviews frequently written by working professionals, as opposed solely to in-house technical equipment overviews. American Photo is without question among the better photo magazines currently available, but unless you are interested mainly in fashion and glamour photography, you might wish to look more closely at Shutterbug or other magazines devote to nature and fine art photography 
I love King magazine! With that said the only thing I would change is the ratio of beautiful ladies to Rim advertisements. You have to flip through several pages of bling before getting to the "meat" of the magazine and the reason I bought it in the first place. I do have to say that I am impressed with how they make it a true mens magazine for people with "exotic" tastes and not a generic magazine with hot girls. BUY IT! 
I'M GLAD THEY FINALLY CAME OUT WITH A MAGAZINE LIKE THIS SO PEOPLE CAN QUIT COMPLAINING. NOW EVERYONE CAN BE HAPPY.... MAGAZINES FOR GUYS THAT LIKE THIN GIRLS, MAGAZINES FOR GUYS THAT LIKE THICK GIRLS. CAN WE ALL GET ALONG NOW? 
The magazine was exactly what I wanted and super cheap through Amazon.com. I am happy with my purchase 
Listen up gents. If your sick and tired of having to put up with what white Hollywood and the queer white fashionistas try to pass off as sexy in "Maxim" or "FHM" and all that bulls--t, then you need to peep "King" where you get to see F.I.N.E. fine sistas like Gabrielle Union, Trina, Syleena Johnson. This magazine is out there for the BROTHAHS!! No flatbacks, no Barbies dipped in chocolate. All BLACK WOMAN! CHECK THIS OUT !! 
King, the ultimate mens mag. You name it, it has it in it. It's not just about the beautiful women, the stories, the articles, music, movie and games and i did mention the women right? If there is one magazine that should be on a man's coffee table, this one should be right next to the remote 
Hey this magazine is geared to the black man but I love it for the hot curvy bootylicious black models and celebrity guest pictorials. Where else are you going to see Gabrielle Union showing all that sweet chocolate goodness? It ain't going to be in Maxim or Stuff. Those two magazines seem to think there are only two black women on the planet... Thandie Newton (a white girl dipped in caramel) and --of course-- the ubiquitous Halle Berry. But this mag has way too many ads 
This is my favorite maganzine. I like the women in it. They look good. Finally good looking girls. Get a subscription 
Fitness magazine? Uh, no I don't think so... You do get a very good look at their bodies though. I was shocked to see my local supermarket carrying this. It's about as racy as a magazine can be without crossing the "naked" barrier (it puts FHM, Maxim, et al to shame, and not just in terms of bare flesh - the photography + writing are better, too). In conclusion, I will say that I wish this had existed when I was a teenager - I wouldn't have had to ride my bike miles across the moors to buy Penthouse from the Indians (who couldn't tell how old I was) 
This magazine is an interesting mix of pictures of hot women wearing very little, short articles on sexual improvement books, health, and beaty products. If any other these interest you; I would highly recommend this mazagine. 
A most excellent magazine. I have had a subscription for this magazine for several years and have never been disappointed! This magazine is comparible to Maxim and FHM in the States. However it is greatly superior. The photography is excellent and contains more nudity than than maxim or similar magazines. 
Basically this magazine is a British Maxim. Same humor, same layout, same themes. The reason I like it more than Maxim is because I'm really into British culture, so I obviously have an interest in the view pointo of the magiazine. So if your interested in babes, pop culture, and sex, stick with one of your American equivalents. But if your looking for the same things in Britain, then this is the magazine for you 
This self-described 'Handbook of the American Entrepeneur' is one fine piece of work. I read it cover to cover upon arrival. INC. is the kind of practical brain food with just the right touch of attitude that keeps ideas spinning and feeds the pragmatic lobe of the brain with excellent practical tips. When compared to FAST COMPANY, its main competitor, INC. is the more conventional entrepeneur's read. It is to the entrepeneur what MONEY magazine is to the personal investor. When you run your own company, you get a little uppity. Everybody who wastes your time is stealing your money. Every vacuous pontification robs your time. INC. communicates that kind of I'm-responsible-for-this-gig-so-don't-waste-my-time attitude without posing. Some great editing makes for innovative article selection, like the October 2006 ranking of state governor's according to what they've done for the entrepeneurial climate in their realm. Don't think twice. Go for INC 
I have been a subscriber to Inc. for several years. It is one of the few magazines that discusses the personalities, struggles, successes and failures of businesses of many sizes. It's a key resource for anyone considering starting their own business, working in a family or other small business. The writing is top notch, the subjects intelligent. A breeze to read 
Now i dont usually write reviews for things, but when i do its because i really like it or i really hate it. And i must say this is one of the best, if not the best music magazine out there. But before you go on if you like bands like simple plan or new found glory just stop and go read something else. this magazine is for indie rock fans or just plain rock. They give you reviews on at least 30 albums and have great interviews with artists. Now this is not like "Spin" who jumps on anything that is popular at the moment to make some money. I enjoyed reading this summers issue ( with Death Cab for Cutie on the front) so much that I ordered it the day i got the magazine. A must have for indie fans 
This is not your tipical music mag with all the coorporate mainstream bull. This mag turns you on to what is up and coming in the music world and is a great tool for finding new music. I recomend it to everyone that enjoys good music 
as a new subscriber i have only gotten one issue of under the radar. however the one issue i have recieved is fantastic. it has pages of great reviews and a very in-depth story on the cover artist. there is virtually no filler and there's page after page of stories on up and coming talent and lesser known musicians. this also isn't a magazine that you breeze through in 20 minutes and never look at again. my only complaint about this magazine is it's quarterly publication, i wish i could have one every month. under the radar is worth the money to subscrib 
It may be called "Under the Radar," but this indie-rock music mag is way above average. Stuffed with insightful articles, relevant news and outstanding bands, Under the Radar is a must-have for fans of good indie-pop, rock and blow-your-mind alternative. Don't look for greasy gossip or trends -- just music, music and music. It starts off with some smaller interviews and Q, which still manage to be insightful as they interview people like Stephen Malkmus and Interpol. Then it's on to the major articles -- in-depth studies of the bands and the individual people. But Under the Radar also delves into the background of the music, how the bands feel about their fans, the inspiration, the side projects, and much more. Under the Radar also keeps an eye on the future: They cover future music releases by bands like Hot Hot Heat, the Doves, and Sparklehorse, as well as giving tabs on what other bands (Broken Social Scene) are doing in the limbo between albums. And of course -- new bands! They offer some good looks into promising newcomers who are just starting out in the musical world. The music-journalism world has undergone a bit of a revolution -- commercialized, aging mags like Spin and Rolling Stone are being supplanted by smaller but more relevant magazines like Filter and the online Kludge. Under the Radar is one such magazine -- except for frequency, there is nothing to complain about in this wonderfully in-depth, well-written exploration of good music -- Modest Mouse, Dntel, Beta Band, Clinic, the Decemberists, Sun Kil Moon and much more. Let's get this out of the way quickly -- compared to most music magazines, Under the Radar comes out infrequently. As a result, if you pick it up in a bookstore, you may find that the "future releases" have already come out. However, the insightful content and all the music it can introduce you to are worth the wait. The interviews are the best part of it all. The writing is calm, without the hyperactive, jokey wannabe-coolness that most magazines are infected with. The interviewers and columnists for Under the Radar are respectful and laid-back -- no "about your girlfriend" questions, thankfully. In these interviews, the musicians seem relaxed and at ease, like they know they're in good hands. But they can also be solemn -- in the sixth issue, Marcus Kagler gives a poignant tribute to the late Elliott Smith, remembering what Smith was like. While still a relative newcomer, Under the Radar shows that it it should be up there with Mojo and Filter as a must-have for music geeks. Toss out your copies of Rolling Stone and pick up Under the Radar instead 
In some circles, to arrive at the office without having read the Wall Street Journal is like turning up in your boxer shorts and a sneaker. In other circles, the same can be said of 'CT', as it is known to regular readers, which include virtually everyone of influence in the evangelical movement in America. As a CT reader for more than thirty years, I have lived with this monthly's evolution from the thought journal that the late theologian Carl Henry wished it to be, empowered to drag American evangelicalism - kicking and screaming if need be - out of the cultural backwaters. Gradually, and by means of the separation of Henry from the project, it became a more general-access piece of the kind that fellow founder Billy Graham is said to have desired. General access is no kidding. Circulation has mushroomed over the decades and given rise to something of a Christianity Today Empire around evangelicalism's Mecca, Wheaton, Illinois. With CT, you get news, analysis, some extremely well-written columns, and a dose of measured opinion, all of which purports to represent evangelicalism's 'middle', even if this is a constantly moving and morphing target. More belligerent alternatives (think WORLD magazine) have sprung up to lead the culture wars, Southern Baptists have been largely coopted into the evangelical movement, and frequent contributions from evangelicalism's Christian college faculties have made CT a confident product of the evangelical establishment. Now firmly distinguished from fundamentalism - a distinction that, astonishingly, is still routinely missed by cultural elites from outside the movement - CT allows itself to cringe at antics on both the left and the right of American Christianity. The magazine has also developed a fine instinct for recognizing the leading edge of Christian activity before it becomes a recognizable trend. Hugely influential, occasionally claustrophobic, rarely maddening, always worthwhile. CT is the WSJ of the neo-evangelical movement. 
As a self-diagnosed Christianity Today junkie, I cannot speak highly enough about Christianity Today as a thoughtful and comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the Christian faith. CT was the brainchild of Billy Graham fifty years ago, and it maintains his strain of Christian perspective, namely evangelicalism. Graham was never interested as a preacher in answering every bit of theological and doctrinal minutiae, nor does Christianity Today aim to do so. Instead, this magazine truly covers the full spectrum of issues that impact the lives of Christians, from news stories of current events and biographies of leaders within the church to analyses of important social and spiritual matters and controversial battles (past and present). CT offers a genuinely global perspective of Christianity, telling missionary stories from around the world in each issue. There are stories of successful and thriving churches of every stripe and descriptions of the victories and successes that occur within all sorts of denominations and ecclesiastical organizations. And they periodically include debates or discussions from opposing sides of important theological ideas, offering folks from both sides a forum to state their case. One of the things that I appreciate most about Christianity Today is their passion to do journalism the right way as Christians. They publish articles by writers with whom many of their readers will not necessarily agree, and they chronicle the lives of many folks who may be outside the church or at least affiliated with a fringe movement. They do all of this while maintaining an unabashedly clear evangelical center, which is most clearly communicated through the editorials in each issue. I love the heart of this magazine and its leadership. I love their approach to their charge as evangelical Christian journalists. I truly read each issue, cover to cover, including all of the advertisements and even the classified ads! I feel like I remain a well-educated and informed Christian when I immerse myself in this amazing resource. I find myself copying or forwarding links to at least one or two articles from each issue to friends and family whose lives I know will be touched as mine always is when I invest in reading from the pages of Christianity Today. I would recommend it to anyone. 
1) A "Why Not?" page toward the beginning of the magazine, with short blurbs on useful things to do. An example: Where to recycle corks from wine bottles. Another example: How to turn dead leaves on your lawn into mulch to fertilize your yard, rather than bagging up the leaves. 2) Lots of recipes and cooking tips (The current issue includes vegetarian dishes.) 3) Reader's tips on a "question of the month." Example: "How do you save money during the holidays?" One winner each month receives a prize. 4) A Solutions section, including "New Uses for Old Things." For each item, the original purpose is described along with an "Aha! Use." 5) A section on organizing. 6) "Road Tests." Four items are featured, with comparisons in each category. This month: winter gloves, food processors, cleansing cloths, and vanilla ice cream. Even if you are not shopping for these items now, the info is useful for later. Two years ago, I bought an extremely reasonably priced set of durable everyday glassware based on their recommendation, and I have been very pleased with the glasses. 7) "Life Lessons." Personal, reflective essays that are very thoughtful and ispiring. 8) Home (including decorating), beauty, style, and body (health) sections. I discovered a great website for world art (supported by National Geographic, not of the commercialized Pier One variety), thanks to them. 9) A "Life" section that includes tips on how to navigate conflicts and difficult situations. 10) This month: A wonderful article on creative ways to preserve your family history. I loved the ideas and loved reading about the contributors' families--absolutely fascinating. 11) Lots of tips on saving money, time, and energy. Many of their tips do not involve trips to the store (or online shopping, for that matter). 12) A cardstock pull-out reference page in the back, with perforated edges to make small cards that you can carry in your wallet. There is always an inspirational quote (this month's is by P.G. Wodehouse) that you can use as a bookmark. Speaking of quotes, there is always a great quote near the front of the magazine and another on the spine of the cover. Yes, there is a target demographic for this magazine. I am not sure whether I would actually fit Time, Inc.'s target demographic--I am a single graduate student, living in a small apartment--but I always learn a lot from each issue. Not every article appeals to me equally, but that is always the case with a magazine. I save the best articles and file them by topic in a binder, along with articles from Vegetarian Times (the only other magazine to which I subscribe) and Runner's World (a friend gives me her old magazines). The hefty amount of advertising is annoying, but this is the result of the consolidation of the magazine publication world. Time, Inc., also publishes In Style, Essence, and many other magazines. If you want a non-glitzy, anti-establishment magazine, read something like B*tch (yes, it is an actual magazine, although I censored the title for this review, and I love it--will probably subscribe one of these days). But if you are just looking for ways to make your life a little easier, order Real Simple. It's not going to teach you how to give up all of your earthly possessions and move to a Peruvian village where you can start your own subsistence farm and weave your fabric from a loom, but it will give you tips on how to make your day-to-day life simpler right where you are. Oh, and Real Simple is branching out: a great website, three published books (on organizing, tips, and cooking), and a show on PBS. No, not TLC or HGTV, but free television for everyone. Kind of populist for an entity of Time, Inc., isn't it 
Nice replacement for my Oprah Magazine. Like the concise and to the point articles. Good suggestions sprinkled in magazine. Very heavy with the advertisements...but then the ads rip out quickly, leaving a more simple Real Simple read. 
"As we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people." ~P.G. Wodehouse, Something New Creative advertising (love the GE firefly ad), practical advice for your home and luxurious perfumes all blend effortlessly throughout the pages of Real Simple. There I was wondering when I should replace a down comforter and this magazine had the answer. They also have some lovely quotes and ideas for decorating your home with Liz Claiborne home items, like the lovely bedding and towels. The do it yourself features are fun with ideas like a hostess gift you make up yourself with a basket and candles. Loved the articles like "organizing your recipes; 8 foolproof methods." But their advice on tossing cookbook in favor of just keeping a few recipes! Hello. There are some cookbooks you definitely want to keep. They always seem to put a spin on old favorites, like the modern cheesecake that is gourmet and elegant. The applesauce cake in the November issue uses chunky applesauce so people might think you spent all that time chopping apples. ~The Rebecca Review 
REAL SIMPLE is exactly what the name implies. There is no clutter on the pages, which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter. It's excellent for those individuals that can't multi-task well and never throw anything away 
I am not a big magazine reader -- never have been, never really had time to! However, a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read...after falling in love every time read it I finally I had to get a subscription of my own! This magazine covers everything! It's got tips for life, cooking, decorating, organzing, and getting the best deal for your money. A lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas, for instance, are stuff that I use and apply to my normal life. For example: the July 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler. The result of that recipe was a WONDERFUL dessert for my family of four that took me... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great! They don't endorse products NEARLY to the same degree that most magazines do, and when they do it's in an article where they had comparisons done...always a recommendation, and usually more than one. The important thing here is they don't say "buy this product" they say "buy products that have such and such feature, make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair, and oh here's an example of what we're talking about." They make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme. So, in conclusion, if you're like me and can use a few extra ideas about EVERYTHING in your life...this is a great magazine. The information is helpful, applicable to normal everyday life...and it's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers 
I just wanted to comment on some of the other reviews that are posted here. Many try to sterotype the type of readers who like Real Simple, well I love this magazine- and didn't manage to fit into any of there categories. My aunt sent me this magazine and then I began to read it monthly, I enjoy the tips and sections like "No time to clean?, quick solutions for every room"- yes they do have product suggestions, but much of the information that is provided can be done with things you already have. Others have called this magazine- " a slave to fashion", as a woman in her 20's I would say this magazine is the one that contains minimal clothing information. Overall I enjoy this magazine, as others have mentioned the recipes are great and I always find plenty of good tips. The photography and layout are amazing, I always use the old editions for reference or crafts 
My mother bought me a gift subscription when I moved in to my first apartment. I love this magazine. I pass the recipies on to family and friends, who have enjoyed them as well. The simple solutions to everyday needs are extremely helpful and well worth the $30 or so for a subscription. I am buying it for a housewarming present for a friend this week. 
I've been a reader since day one and the magazine is filled with time saving tips on cooking, space saving ideas and ideas and even wardrobe tips. For $5 Real Simple offers great tips and Real Simple is geared towards real people with real lives and not the New York loft crowd or mid-west country living crowd...not to be stereotypical but that's how most magazines are geared one coast of the other. Real simple is a great magazine and it continues to be number one in my book. 
This is the intelligent fashion magazine that doesn't treat fashion lovers like idiots! Great in depth articles on screenplays, celebs, charities, politics, and of course - FASHION. Duh! 
VANITY FAIR is a highly recommended monthly magazine for people who enjoy reading. Packed with lengthy articles, gorgeous photography and blurby information, it never fails to entertain the reader. It is the perfect companion for a lazy afternoon at the beach or on quiet plane ride across country. The VANITY FAIR forumla is simple: slap a photo of a celebrity on the cover and inside offer a wide variety of articles, including Hollywood puff pieces, Domenick Dunne's true crime accounts, in-depth articles about international scandals, Christopher Hitchens essays and profiles of colorful, unknown characters. Though this formula has changed little since the magazine was revived in the 1980s by its now legendary editrix Tina Brown, the magazine's new editor, Canadian-born Graydon Carter, has succeeded in putting his own personal stamp on VANITY FAIR. In virtually every issue Carter uses his Letter from the Editor to bash US President Bush. Though I do not begrudge Carter his right to speak his mind, after months of reading Carter's criticism, I get bored with these relentless rants. Still I highly recommend a VANITY FAIR subcription to anyone who enjoys reading. -- Regina McMenami 
I have read Vanity Fair for the past twenty years. The articles are timely and in depth. There are articles on politicians, bankers, CEOs as well as the Hollywood types. This is the magazine for those who want to be in the know. Also, the photographs are fantastic. If you are looking for a two paragraph blurb about the actress/actor of the hour, this is not the magazine for you. 
Let me say straight up, this is a great magazine..it is one of the few magazines that is consistantly good. I have been a subscriber for seven years and I can say without reservations that this is one of the best magazines in print. The contributing writers like, Christopher Hitchens are first rate, I will admit Hitchens is an aquired taste, but he always makes me think..and laugh everytime I read his essay's, whether I agree or not. I also enjoy reading Dominic Dunne's diary, he really does have a great life, and he knows everyone..who's anyone, granted he is a total gossip and a social butterfly, but he knows it, he is in on the joke so to speak. I was afraid the quality of the magazine would suffer when the singular Tina Brown left, but Greydon Carter has continued her steller helmsmanship. I highly recommend this magazine, I really don't know a soul who has subscribed to this magazine that has not loved it..honest 
"true detective" is a classic old magazine. my 83 year old father in law loved seeing it again. an early father's day gift. he read it from front to back in a day. we were surprized to see it was shipped from England! my mother in law and i split the cost. it was well worth the money to order it, because he "truely" enjoyed it! thanks! lyn 
Most of this magazines travel articles and ads are not targeted at someone like me. I'm a homemaker with a limited budget. I don't travel much or am in the market for the fancy things they advertise. However, I just renewed my subscription becuase when I have tried the recipes in the magazine they were really wonderful. I've added every recipe I've tried from Gourmet to my 'keeper' recipe binder. I admit, the dishes were harder to make but the results were definitely worth the trouble 
I am a budding cook. I enjoy it immensely as a hobby. I like to be inspired by as many outside sources as possible. I recently started subscribing to "Gourmet" magazine. While I do agree that there is lots of advertisements, more than necessary and maybe one too many travel articles, I still enjoy reading the magazine page for page. What I can appreciate about this magazine that it is slightly more less high end than its rival "Bon Appetit" which I think over the years has become more geared to the snobby food lover than to those who live on a budget. There are still quite a bit of recipes that are quite fancy but there seems to be a good number of recipes that are simple and basic, not to mention affordable for those on a budget and aren't concerned with the presentation of the dish. I enjoy reading "Gourmet". I wish they would cut down on the travel articles and ads and include more recipes but otherwise it's a good source of inspiration for me 
PC World keeps me up to date with what's new in the industry and gives me lots of helpful hints to improve my computing experience. 
Great magazine for those who are not tech professionals, or who have just started in a tech field, who want to stay on top of the latest products, ideas, and technology news. Good troubleshooting tips for your computer, software programs, and other electronics as well. Loved it so much I decided to order a year's subscription. ***DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON. I ORDERED THE MAG SEPT 7TH AND AS OF DEC 3RD I AM STILL WAITING FOR IT. Amazon is a reliable party, however the subscriptions are outsourced to others. If you have a problem with a subscription order, it is not handled through Amazon.*** UPDATE: Finally received 1st issue in late December and the subscription was backdated to continue through Nov 2006. However, if you want quicker delivery, order a subscription elsewhere 
When I bought PC World at a store, the cover looked appealing. It had an advice on how to surf the Internet trouble free. So I brought it home and started reading it. I was amazed! I have never read a magazine cover to cover before, but I read this one word for word. This mag is filled with tons of reviews of best software and new gadgets. It also has unbiased articles written in a balanced simple English and technical language on computing in general. Perhaps the best part about the magazine is the CD they include with it. iT is filled with PC World recommended software that will make your life much easier. IF you never heard of PC World, you don't know what you're missing. Go to the nearest store and ask for the copy. You'll be glad you di 
After switching from Mac OS to Windows a few years ago, I needed a PC-oriented magazine to get me well versed in the new vernacular. I took a look at PC Magazine and was disgusted by the number of errors and the dearth of useful content; man, I thought, this is why Mac users laugh at PC guys. Then I picked up PC World at the suggestion of a friend and, wow, within minutes I filled out the subscription card and sent for my subscription. PC World is good because it's informative and useful. It covers things you want to know as a PC user. It does not slant toward hardware (like the modders-only Maximum PC) or software, and it doesn't waste space telling you why you should buy a Mac G5, which, oddly enough, PC Mag tries to do. PC World is a well-balanced, informational magazine for general PC users. If you want more expert-oriented stuff you might want things like Windows Mag or other more specific magazines, but for general computing, PC World is the best. Each issue is packed with stuff you can use, either in your daily computing or to impress your friends at the new year's party 
NYRB and the Atlantic Monthly are among my favorite subscriptions; In terms of sheer intellectual depth and range, it is very tough to beat the NYRB. While I do not read the NYRB cover to cover, I end up spending at least 5 hrs on each issue. The main strength of this magazine is the fact that a typical article is written by an expert with deep knowledge of the subject (some times opinionated; but always intelligent and engaging). While the article typically draws on more than a single book, I like the fact that the article is typically written as a commentary around a theme and is more than a summary of the books under review. 
This magazine couldnt possibly get any more helpful than it allready is. My only complaint is the 4 issues a month. Other than that it is allmost flawless. Anyone interested in film making at all should get a subscription 
Moviemaker is great for the beginner and the pro-indie alike. This magazine features interviews with Hollywood moguls as well as independant greats. There are helpful articles ranging from what DVDs that can serve as film school to festival information. Everything is informative, even if it's just a short bit about a new type of equipment. Moviemaker may not come out monthly, but each issue is worth the wait! 
You may get a Subscription for $19.99 if you pull out a loose insert from one of the magazines on the shelf at the books store or super market 
My wife and I love this magazine. It offers objective reviews of kitchen equipment, which is rare. The recipes are very much a step up from what you get in the family magazines (Good Housekeeping, Sunset, etc.) without being so elaborate that you are not motivated to try them as is sometimes the case with some of the dedicated food magazines. And, the helpful hints are actually helpful! Another appreciation is that the magazine is limited in the number of recipes per month. I find that helps provide some focus. I do feel obliged to let you know that you will receive a noticeable amount of mail from their mailing list. To me, this is a very minor annoyance and it doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the magazine. But, it is something you should be aware of 
If you are a savvy food geek or just like to cook, the indepth information presented in this magazine is thourough, scientific,and well researched. Amazing 
I love this magazine. It is EASY reading and what you read is easy to digest. There are so many tidbits of information that I find so useful. It makes me want to live a healthier life, and also have a healthier family. Since subscribing to it, I find that I have changed the way I do a lot of things. It's my favorite magazine which I compare to a ray of sunshine. 
Prevention is more of a guilty pleasure to me than anything else. It's definitely not a magazine that you file away with your beloved books (I do that with Victoria, Real Simple, and O), but you take a little something from each issue. It does contain a lot of excellent information ranging from herbs to emotional health to physical conditions, but the articles are really more than one or two pages long (at the most) and it doesn't take long to read from cover to cover. Regardless, I enjoy it, and usually learn something new and interesting with each issue. I'm not a complete health nut, but I am interested in long term issues and try to look out for myself. Most health magazines (with the exception of Health) are too specific- each article really only applies to a certain group of people, but most of the articles in Prevention apply to the entire readership as a whole. There's very few of us out there not struggling with stress or interested in ways of preventing heart disease or cancer 
In every issue I always find a good review, and very good tips on making me more productive with mi Mac Mini 
No, I'm not a salesman for Macworld -- at least, they're not paying me anything for being one. I only know, as an owner of Macs for over 25 years, that Macworld will repeatedly show you how to do things that (1) you always wanted to do on a Mac, and (2) you didn't know you could do on ANY computer. See, a key reason you're buying a Mac is that it makes it possible to do so very many things easily that a PC either can't do or makes very difficult. Right? Well, as easy as Macs do make most things, there are still a lot of details that can be hard to absorb quickly when you're just trying to make things work. Especially when you feel as though you could erase something vital accidentally with just the push the wrong button. MACWORLD GETS THAT, and has LOTS of easy-to-undertstand articles on how to reduce your fears, get things done, and even simplify the processes in the long run. Plus, they have a website, where you can look up past and side articles that pertain to exactly what you are trying to do. In addition, as a new Mac owner, you'll find that there are tons of outside companies -- large and small -- that make software and peripherals for Macs. Most are very good, but some are so geek-centric that it can be hard to understand whether what they have to offer is beneficial to you or just more crap on your system. Macworld is very smart about helping you understand which ones to pay attention to and which ones to avoid. Lastly, I suggest you think of Macworld as you would a guide to your favorite hobby. That is, it's likely to have a lot of information that you know, but it will also constantly update you on aspects that you don't. Plus, since new products come out constantly for the Mac, it will also keep you up-to-date on what's available that may or may not make sense for you. In the long run, I predict that you'll soon find a Macworld subscription to be one of the cheapest (and most valuable) investments you've ever made. And good luck with your new Mac. Welcome to the fold 
Macworld's glossy monthly has been around for about as long as Apple has been making Macs. I've been a subscriber for most of that time and - if I had saved past issues - could probably paper Cupertino's main streets with this periodical's pages. There are a number of magazines devoted to Macs and their unusually devoted users. Macworld is probably the most mainstream and dependable of them. As with most periodicals dedicated to high-tech fields, there is more in these pages than the casual user can digest. Many of the articles appeal to the MacGroupies subset of MacUsers, those who find the product fascinating in itself rather than merely a boon to productivity dedicated to other ends. However, even a normal MacUser like myself (since 1987) can enjoy the coverage of all things Apple, including the constant improvements for which the company has become known and the relentless speculation about What Comes Next. A small tornado of a controversy brews in the pages over whether Macworld should dedicate so much space to iPod and music issues, but Apple seems to have fairly dictated by its sprint in that direction that a magazine dedicated to covering the company's products will need to follow the direction it sets. There are lots of productivity hints that - if followed - will keep you increasing your own effectiveness on the machine. The most useful feature for me has been the high-quality discussion of the improvements Apple continues to build into its own operating system(s). Macworld is the go-to Mac magazine, if that's what you need 
Five ESSENTIAL Stars. Macworld Magazine is the one magazine that has it ALL in one convenient place and is absolutely necessary for the Macintosh computer user. Published monthly, it is chock full of articles on and reviews of the latest Macintosh/Apple equipment, software, applications, games, browsers, neat websites, and other essential products and services. From the "FEEDBACK" letters to the editor that have real substance, to an extensive "REVIEWS section covering areas like cameras, camcorders, printers, notebooks, laptops, desktops, CD DVD recorders, etc.., to the in-depth "SECRETS" covering areas like 'the Working (office or home office) Mac', 'Digital Photo', 'Mobile Mac', 'Geek Factor', the awesome Mac OSX 'Help Desk', and the essential helpmate 'Mac 911', Macworld is the Gold Standard. It even has regular tutorials for the daring Darwin UNIX user, giving the real geeks a literal software tool kit into the inner workings of Steve Job's marvelous computer (only for the most experienced expert user). Even in cases when another magazine has a similar article, Macworld always seems to do it better, probably because it has been at the Mac publishing game longer than any other magazine to my knowledge. The arrival of Macworld magazine at your home or office each month will cause you to set aside an hour or two to read the magazine from cover to cover, and if you're like me, store it for future use. Some competing Mac magazines come with a monthly CD disk with applications, utilities, and games, but Macworld has an interesting solution in this area: they provide a "Virtual CD", based on a URL, found at the bottom of the table of contents, that leads you to a webpage full of monthly surprises normally found on a monthly disk, eliminating the need for an evergrowing stash of computer magazine CDs. Plus you have access to previous month's articles and columns. Great idea. Five Big "CORE DUO" Stars! 
MacWorld is required reading for the serious Mac user. It reports the latest changes in Mac software and hardware from both Apple and third-party vendors. Reviews of the latest products are essential so that you can decide when to upgrade your existing system 
I just received my first order, and I love it! This magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques, current trends, period styles and so much more. It has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles. I think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics, and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits 
I love House Beautiful! It gives so many wonderful ideas. This is a collection of ecclectic styles, patterns, and methods that will suit anyone's taste. And these ideas aren't hard to follow. With the smallest effort, anyone can follow the look they have in the magazine 
Vogue fantastic high fashion photos. If you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at Vogue. However, as other reviews have indicated, the articles are quite lacking. They are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting. So, you get Vogue for the pictures. If your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine, if you want something to read get something else 
For me, the September issue of Vogue, with its 700 page issue, is more than eye candy. It's art. It's that simple. I no longer look at most of the fashion in the magazine, nor the models, as realistic, something that can ever transfer into my own life, nor would I want it to. It reminds me of trips to art museums where I can admire one painting half the afternoon, but it doesn't mean I want it hanging on my wall at home. Vogue's photography is exquiste, pure art. The glossy pages, the vibrant, sometimes muted colors, seem to jump off the page. The images make my mind wander and explore. When I finally got over the ridiculous prices and the more ridiculously thin models with legs longer than I am tall, I was able to fully appreciate the artistry of the ads and fashion spreads. I find the ads are as engaging as the fashion spreads, which is a good thing, for the magazine is at least half ads. Some of the articles are good as well. I skip over the few society articles, and I've been surprised at the number of well-written pieces that apply to the average well-educated, sophisticated person. No, Cosmo readers most likely won't find much in Vogue, but I'd say women over 30, who are relatively world-wise, will find articles geared toward them. Overall, Vogue is a high end publication that has high end photographers and produces rather sweet eye candy with some decent non-fashion articles 
When I was a little girl I always tried to steal my friend mother's "Cosmopolitan". I didn't really understand what Cosmo really was, but at the time I truly believed that was what every women read. My mother found me reading it with my friend and almost lost her mind, when I came back from school a vogue was waiting for me in the mailbox. I thought it was my mother's but she told me if I was going to idolize a women's magazine and wouldn't stick to my Highlights or American Girl, I would idolize something sensible. I was just a little girl glancing at the glossy pages of high end clothing from Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent, loving each beautiful model, amazed by the greatest photos ever taken for a fashion magazine (Annie Leibovitz has become the most used and artistically drawn photographer used by Vogue), and the best articles that can be used for brainless reading material or important advice. Six years later I'm still reading Vogue (and can use the advice more productively than I could have when I was twelve.) I sort of matured faster than other girls, while they were talking about who were they taking for the dance, I was discussing why the price of silk and taffeta were lowering due to China's economy expansion and about Tom Ford designing for the retired Yves Saint Laurent....well not exactly but you get my point. One down side is I've gotten addicted to the evils the Vogue brings. From it's amazing ads, I've come to love the more expensive things in life, like designer handbags and beautiful coats. I've even gone on more diets I can count (but this comes from Anna Wintour, who even told Oprah "I would love to be on our cover--but you have to loose 30", the woman is persistant about thinness in her magazine.) However, I truly feel that I have become the woman I am today instead of boxer wearing tomboy with no manners at all, because of Vogue. The reason I gave only four stars is because I'm truly starting to apperciate W Magazine. It has the need to know gossip, the longer pages, and more of a down to earth approach for those who really don't associate, or can stand, the socialite world. 
Hello, this will be the third time in the last many years that I've received, and read, UR on a regular basis. I agree with most of the other reviews. However, what I find most outstanding about the magazine is how uplifting, and ultimately positive, it is. I subcribe to several dozen web sites, from the media from around the world, most of which are far left of "liberal." While I take everything that I receive, through all forms of media, with a very large "grain of salt," I do tend to put much more stock in what I read on the web than I do in what the mainstream media feeds us, especially that from the U.S. Therefore, as a result of that reading, I often feel sorrow, rage, cynicism, and/or depression. Utne's positive spin on issues, even when the subject is inherently distressful, inspires me, as almost no other form of media does (except, sometimes, music), to rise up out of any negativity that I may be indulging in, and take positive steps toward helping to make our world a better place for us all. For that, I am very grateful to everyone who is responsible for such a fine magazine. Thank you, Utne 
The images in this magazine are always first rate and the editors get access to houses no one else does. The writing is also very good and the houses chosen for each month are always in varing designs and spectucular. This magazine does have a certain reputation of being on all the coffee tables of the wealthy, but is not Town and Country, it really is a magazine that takes its name seriously and the writers are well informed and have skill. Pick it up sometime, it's worth the effort. 
In summary, this magazine portrays houses that you can't possibly ever hope to own in an "airbrushed" presentation that can't possibly match real life; it is "house pornography". It is exciting to read and puts plenty of ideas into your head. You have to determine whether repeated exposure to this type of media will enhance your life or make you miserable. Hey, if you have a spare million dollars and need someone to tell you what is fashionable or in good taste--this is for you! People complain about the ads--I complain about the articles. People get in the way. I note that none of the owners of these showpiece homes have children--most are living alternative lifestyles. Actually, the house becomes the product of the relationship instead of children. It is a fascinating cultural phenomenon and this magazine is the leading journal of the movement. 
I love this magazine. Some reviewers have stated that they disliked some of the interiors. That's fine and fun! I show my husband some of the things (he's a graphic designer) and we have a great time laughing at some of the designs. Other times it's absolutely great. The latest issue (Aug. 2004) is one of the best and the theme is Exotic Homes Around The World, and they are all fantastic. Of course I wish I could afford a lovely home such one of these in the magazine (maybe one day?) but in the meantime I can look at these homes and dream and also get great design ideas. This magazine is wonderful and relaxing to look at and read 
Fido Friendly was a great help in our search to find not just any hotel, but a 4star hotel that more than welcomed our two goldens. The articles are very interesting and fun to read

Harper's, like the Atlantic and The New Yorker is written for those looking for more in-depth analysis and coverage on political and cultural affairs with a sampling of serious literary prose. Personally I prefer the Atlantic, which I read regularly, only picking up Harper's when I have time and something in it interests me, which is usually two or three times a year. Just looking at the cover and pages inside convey Harper's as a serious tome, perhaps too serious for the casual reader, especially compared to the more colorful pages of the Atlantic and playful New Yorker cartoons. Nevertheless, Harper's is an American icon in it's genre having published many articles from great names since it's inception in 1850. A number of reviewers complain about it being left leaning and that stance clearly sprouts from the now recently departed editor Lewis Lapham, who has been an outspoken critic of the current administration. Mr. Lapham shares his views in a two page opinion piece and in the full page listing of various "fun facts" known as the Harper's Index. Serious readers will be able to get beyond this as simply a "viewpoint" and see the entire magazine for the serious writing that it is. I would contend this represents the best in "critical analysis" rather than bias. I would also simply suggest you view the other reviews made by people espousing this periodical as overly biased. For instance, at least one of those claiming liberal bias here is also praising an Ann Coulter book. So if you feel underwhelmed by the typical content you get even in a 60 minute broadcast or a political round table free-for-all and you're interested enough in this magazine to read it's reviews, you should probably pick up a copy of it for two or three months and give it a try. I recommend you also check out The New Yorker and the Atlantic to compare 
Harper's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest American- writers , from Mark Twain on down. Its editor and tone- setter is the veteran journalist Lewis Lapham. It publishes fiction, and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of American economic, political and cultural life. It attracts the big - names in all areas, and also provides a lot of human - interest material, statistical curiosities, historical information and stories. For some reason which I do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite. And in the old days I preferred 'the Atlantic' and the 'Saturday Review of Literature ' to it. Of course one of the features of 'Harper's is its book- reviews done by among others today, John Leonard. I suppose what has soured me a bit on 'Harper's' is its bias to the political left. But that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality 
This is a fun read. The articles are entertaining and short. Good to pass some time. Excellent for the plane! 
People is a weekly American magazine of celebrity and human interest stories,the magazine runs a roughly mix of celebrity and human interest stories,People is perhaps best known for its yearly special issues naming "The 50 Most Beautiful People", "The Best and Worst Dressed", and "The Sexiest Man Alive".I think people magazine is a wonderful magazine because I can keep in touch on what is happy to the actors and actress. What the good movies are that are good for me to watch. I think ya'll do a good job with the magazine. It is worth reading every time I get it.People also includes reviews of new books, cds and movies. 
An interesting and enjoyable magazine if you like reading about celebs. If not: This is not the magazine for you. Very rarely will you see someone on the cover of people for being involved in politics or saving someone's life or whatever. Instead you'll learn about Branjelina's baby, the ongoing divorce struggles of Jess and Nick, and other such stuff. But I am not condemming the magazine; I myself enjoy sitting down with it every week and would reccommend it to you 
I find that many people had a lot of negative things to say about "People" magazine and its coverage of celebrities. Opinion leaders are opinion leaders because they have clout and power and communication lines. What they say and do does make an impact. I don't find it offensive to read about them, and I also create my own life and don't need to be "entertained." My suggestion is to be less critical and more active in making a better world. The opinion leaders are for the most part, doing that better than the average guy, -- that's why they are opinion leaders. Dorothy 
Item was delivered when I was told it would be and I didn't have any other issues regarding this purchase. I'd say that's pretty smooth 
I picked up a copy of this mag last time I was in the states. I found the articles informative and in-depth. This is not another one of those mags where they review the latest wiz-bang comsumer camera or accessory. It is a magazine for those advanced amateurs looking to develop a better understanding of their craft and thereby improve their skill. I highly recommend giving it a read if you are in this category. 
Recently my family was visiting a relative in the hospital. I spotted the 60th anniversary issue of Highlights for Children. In perusing it I noted how the magazine's style and format had evolved over the years. In showing the magazine to my [...] year old daughter, I realized that Higlights appeal to children had not waned since I was a kid. My daughter simply adored it. She especially liked the riddles. She has asked us to get a subscription, which we will gladly oblige her with come Christmas. 
I read Highlight Magazine faithfully when I was a child. Now I am a mother of two (2nd grade and Kind.). I just got a tip from a teacher at school - the writers of the Highlight (Harcourt) also write the exam for the 3rd grade state test in New York state. 
Highlights magazine is the New Yorker of children's literature. Following that analogy, the Nickelodean Magazine or Disney Princess might be the In Touch Weekly's of children's lit. Highlights may at times feel outdated and stale (as might the New Yorker), but overall the quality is consistent and there is plenty to enjoy. The Hidden Picture puzzle alone is worth the price. If you only know the magazine from schools and doctor's waiting rooms from your childhood, you might not have had the chance to see a pristine Hidden Picture puzzle. The pictures end up getting marked up by kids with poor impulse control and listless parents, the future sociopaths of America, who evidently did not absorb any lessons first from Goofus and Gallant. With Highlights you get no advertising, no slick pandering your children, and you get stories, puzzles, projects, poems, and those lovable Timbertoes. It's also good just to get magazines for kids in the mail. I find it to be a nice way to encourage reading in my family. Nothing cuter than going through the mail with the kids after which everyone sits down together, in earnest, and flips through their magazine. 
Invaluable for the do-it-yourself bride who wants a hands-on wedding, or who just wants to save money (don't we all!). From gowns to centerpieces, Martha shows you how to get that expensive designer look without the expensive designer price tags. Her signature taste and elegance are evident in every suggestion. Highly recommen 
This magazine is great!!! The Weddings magazine is for the bride who wants great ideas and advice for a stylish and elegant wedding. The magazine includes great articles for wedding tips, sanity savers and after the wedding advice. Weddings does contain advertisements for attire, BUT that is not their only service. This magazine also includes wonderful "real wedding" stories that are inspiring and give great ideas for your own wedding. I highly recommend this magazine for a more mature bride, or for a bride who already has picked out her dress but still wants great wedding ideas 
This magazine is pretty. I am not that interested in long articles, so the fact that this magazine has alot of pictures helped. 
This has to be my favorite magazine because It has a little bit of everything. Cosmo is about more carnal subjects, Marie Claire has many serious subjects, Vogue is pure fashion, Allure is practically a beauty bible but Glamour has all these things it's that versatility that I like 
After I bought Glamour off the news stand, I read it and completely loved it. The previous reviews were a little bit out of date here on Amazon, and in my opinion, a magazine can transform dramatically in a year, if not less. There's definitely a lot less fluff and a lot of wonderful articles in 2005. For example, there were articles about the emotional hardships with a mom whose kid is mentally ill and the story of up coming star as a happily adopted child. There were articles on women who struggled so that girls today can play in Little League, women can get credit cards and keep their job when they get pregnant. There's a lot of important and powerful article on women's rights with a dose of celebrity life. My favorite article was Aisha Tyler showing us how much digital touchup can do to cover models....it definitely made me feel a lot better about my body. I felt like Glamour had enough dosage with fashion, health news, beauty tips, and celebrity life, but still did a great job to remind us the greatness of being a woman. I gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I had flip through 6 pages of ads before I got to the table on contents. I suppose that's how magazines make their money, but I can do without. Other than that, great mag! If every issues is like the one I read, I'd subscribe to it in a heart beat. 
I love Glamour! This has to be my favorite magazine of all times! Granted the ads drive me nuts but I love the Do and Don'ts and all the clothes. I am a shopping mogul! This magazine is great for showing new trends and I love layering and almost always they are showing new ways of layering clothes and teaching you how to wear your clothes in a different exciting way. I also enjoy the articles and life lessons as there is always something that I am interested in. I read Glamour almost from cover to back! I rarely skip articles! If you like fashion and just articles on every life issues this magazine is for you! **I have noticed a change over the last year in the magazine, but it is not terrible.* 
I've had subscriptions to just about every woman's magazine there is over the past 8 years, but the only one I always renew is "Glamour". It's less "how-to-catch-a-man" oriented than "Cosmo", less pseudo-hipster than "Jane" and less serious than "Marie Claire". While it's certainly no "Ms." magazine, it has a lot of women-positive messages every issue, articles that aren't as sensationalistic and fear-mongering than most found in women's magazines, and lots of fashion and beauty tips. I feel that "Glamour" strikes the right balance between frivolity and seriousness--for those of you who like a side of third-wave feminism with your fashion, I highly recommend it. 
I recieve different magazines over the course of a year. i don't know why. It simply happens that way. Marie Claire is a pleasant surprise. I found in the first issue I read, a group of writers, editors and all involved with this magazine, not just writing about issues, but being proactive. Everyone on the street in NYC in bikinis and whatever each individual felt comfortable with, to bring awareness to skin cancer. Really cool! Each issue has write ups on a certain amount of relevant international and national news for women and other sexes too. they are adding the right amount of consciousness to an otherwise totally fashion magazine which also i have found surprisingly refreshing and fun. Ace Job Marie Claire staff!! 
Every issue of Marie Claire covers everyhting: fashion, makeup, beauty, men, events, how people live around the world, and ways you can help other women suffering from abuse, natural disasters, etc. I hate magazines that only shows clothes and models, and this is not one of them. Marie Claire covers everything and every month, I learn something new after reading it 
As women's magazines go, Marie Claire is definately the best of the bunch. It focuses on more than just fashion. It has serious articles and some cute fun ones, besides. They have had articles on: A woman who obeys an 8-ball for a month A man who wears make-up for a week Thai prostitution Self-image Stress What women around the world keep in their underwear drawers And lots and lots on fashion They have a nice mix of articles. You can always find an article or two that you really like in each issue 
Mystery Scene is a feast of fascinating articles, excellent interviews (check out Alexander McCall Smith, in the summer 2003 issue), intelligent reviews, and all kinds of information about the world of mystery writing. In addition, it's that rare magazine of any genre--an absolutely un-put-downable, cover-to-cover read 
This is the ultimate magazine for mystery readers and mystery writers. From front cover to back, it's full of the information you need to know about new books, favorite authors, and what's going on in the mystery business 
I am a professional cook who has an expansive collection of cookbooks and food magazine subscriptions, and Gastronomica, without a doubt, is in a class by itself. It's a magazine that relishes all aspects of food culture, from indepth explorations of particular cuisines to quirky analyses of fun foods. Topics as diverse as coca-cola, Vietnamese pho, the parrot eaters, egg creams, irradiated foods, tea drinking, and the all-American butter cake are just a few of the always interesting, usually provocative, and oftentimes entertaining articles you'll read. This offbeat, classy magazine is for the thinking food lover. What a treat 
Gastronomica is a thoughtful, inspirational magazine, filled with insightful commentary on all aspects of food. The well-researched articles reflect the individual passion of its contributors; it is for the "thinking cook" who values substance over fluff. 
Well, they've not got a new Editor-In-Chief, the former executive editor, and well seeing as how I dont like him, I think it's brought the whole magazine down. There still is the now playing column in the Eyewitness section, and some of the staff, have gotten new pictures. I believe it was the June issue when this started, and they also changed the design of the magazine too, which of course bothers me less than the EIC. Of course, if u want to go with the old editor, then start reading the Official Xbox Magazine, because he's the new Chief there and I think he's increased the quality of that magazine ten-fold. The disc is still fine as usual, but for a good and humorous PC games magazine, pick up Computer Gaming World 
I have been an avid reader for over 40 years, I was always looking out for magazines that gave book reviews, I tried them all including New york Times Book Review, found them lacking at alot of ways. When I subscriped to Pages: The Magazine for People Who Love Books, I was exploring again, but; I found this the best and most comperhensive magazine on book reviews, it is what I've been looking for a long time, give a try, I sure you would be satisfied as I was. 
I don't know why so many people don't like this magazine. It's everything a person who really likes books could want. There's decently written articles, and there's so much information in every issue. I know I should like the other publication better (I won't name it), but I prefer this one. I don't only like reading books, but I also like looking at their covers and stuff too. I love browsing, and when I can't get to the bookstore I open up a copy of "Pages." 
Great Magazine!!!! Do not order it through Amazon--major headache! Go online with the magazine directly. They remedied the problem immediately...Something Amazon Magazine Dept. couldn't figure out after 7 months...really, 7 months. No problems with the book ordering but will NEVER order a magazine this way again 
This one's my "must read" of the week. In my job, we have access to a plethora of news sources. Still, I don't have time to see what was important in the world by reading each and every one. The Week reduces information to the key arguments, citing recognized media with differing viewpoints. Sixty percent is dedicated to current news and smoking issues, with the remaining forty percent divided among blubs from the entertainment, real estate and epicurean and literary world. They also pick a salient current essay for each issue that runs about two pages. With The Week, I've read key points in world news in sixty minutes 
I have recieved "The Week" for over six months now. When I subscribed it in the begining I really hadn't a clue how much I would actually get from it as far as knowledge goes.I thought it Looked interesting enough and hay it was cheap, so I decided to give it a try. After recieving my first magizine I was hooked. This magizine seemed to cover a variety of things. It covered Politics, Current Events, Heart Touching Stories, Funny but True Stories, Cartoons, Information about different Hollywood Stars, and so much more. I never exspected it to be as info. packed as it was, trust me I have never felt dissatified with any of the magizines from "The Week" that I have recieved. I actually get all excitied when I get them in the mail and I tell my husband, " Yeaaah, My Politics are Here!" I also now got some of my other family hooked on The Week also, We Love It! This magizine has so much information and covers more current events than any other magizine I have seen. It is truely My One Only. I've saved a ton of money and space since I discovered The Week. It's very affordible and I used to buy at least Three other magizines twice a month, (Spending about $20.00 a month) to get the same information I get from The Week for less than a dollar an issue. 
We are charter subscribers to THE WEEK and have been so impressed that we give subscriptions as gifts 
I've been wanting to write a review about this magazine for some time, however, I haven't taken the time to do so until now. After reading the most recent review written by; Bryan Carey, there really isn't much more I can say. I couldn't have written a better review myself, other then the fact I've given the publication 5 stars! As far as I'm concerned this magazine is far better than Time, Newsweek, US News World Rpt., or any other news magazine on the market. I look forward to receiving the new issue every week 
The Week is an interesting publication among magazines! It likes to boast on the cover that it contains "All you need to know about everything that Matters". This magazine doesn't have a huge staff of writers like most magazines. Instead, The Week is a compilation of the best articles, columns, critical reviews, etc., from many different publications. I have read articles in The Week from such noteworthy publications as Financial Times, Business Week, The Chicago Tribune, Fortune, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and many more. The goal of the editors of The Week is to sift through hundreds of thousands of articles each week and look for the cream of the crop in journalistic inspiration. These best articles are then compiled together into one short magazine. What I like most about The Week is that it contains short, concise articles that get right to the point. It's rare to find any reading material in this magazine more than 1 page in length. In fact, most of the reading material is nothing more than short, 2 or 3 paragraph snips from other publications. While the articles don't go in- depth, they are short and simple and that makes them less intimidating to start reading. You feel more at ease to read with this magazine because you can turn directly to an area of interest and pick an article with the knowledge that you will be finished reading it in less than one minute. With other magazines, the length of some articles is often so great that readers will just skim through quickly, due to limited spare time. Another thing I like is that this magazine is basically unbiased. Anything that is significant in the news, politics, arts, etc., has a chance to get printed. That includes articles that are conservative, liberal, and everything in between. The editors of The Week are not concerned about what angle a story takes. They just strive to print articles that are among the best of the week, regardless of what political bias is shown. The Week is a short magazine, averaging only about 40 pages in length. There are very few advertisements in this magazine, which is also nice. In a typical issue, only about 6 pages are covered with ads, which equals only about 15 percent of the total pages. Of course, since the magazine consists of articles from other sources, some might say that it's really just one large advertisement. But it's still nice to have good, quality reading without so many of the ads. Overall, The Week has made me a satisfied subscriber. It's a good way to stay abreast of the latest happenings, trends, and news on a worldwide basis. The articles are short, fun, simple, and direct with splashes of humor throughout. I recommend The Week to just about anyone. It's one of the few magazines that's short enough and entertaining enough that I can read a full issue completely, while still looking forward to the next week's edition to arrive in my mailbox. Give it a try the next time you see a copy. It's a fun and informative read! 
this magazine covers four main aspects: physical fitness, food nutrition, health beauty, and mental/spiritual health. it offers something in each and always has new and interesting information that is easy to understand for a person that is just a beginner in the fitness world or experienced. the focus is on physical fitness, and food, and the information is valid and easy to transfer over into everyday life. workouts are easy to understand, with good photos to illustrate, and almost all can be done without making a trip to the gym. i compared this magazine to self, and found this one to be superior in all ways. although self was almost twice as thick, when i counted the pages of usable information that i wanted to pull out and keep (whether for good recipes, work-outs, articles, or products), fitness had over three times the amount of pages than self. it also has a minimal amount of advertising, compared to magazines such as self that seem to be pages of advertising with a little fluff inbetween every once in a while 
This is a good thing. Anything that can keep the folks moving in the right direction is great. I like the idea of seeing people at the top end of the fitness ladder but also want to see those who are doing the best with what they have. A decent magazine is in a perfect place to make it happen because of the on-going exposure 
Mind, Body Spirt Fitness Magazine is wonderful. I get a lot of exercise ideas from them and I try to incorparate them into my workouts for my clients in Chicago. Thanks Fitnes 
very interesting magazine about women health 
Finally a modern parenting magazine! This magazine is great for expectant mothers and mothers with babies or young children. I even enjoy reading it for the information for adults - recommended vacation spots, beauty advice, etc 
I loved this new magazine. It's like Vogue meets Parenting magazine. The ads were beautiful, you cannot dispute that as with all magazines there were way too many. And they had a few great articles... the article about the make a mess birthday party in a backyard with paint and rolls of paper and feathers was really inspiring. I really enjoyed this magazine and look forward to the next issue 
Everything has gone smoothly from the moment I ordered Entertainment Weekly from this seller. It's a pleasure to do business with them and I plan on using them again in the future for my next magazine purchase. 
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY really understands the whole arena of entertainment from film to television to DVD to music to games to even hand-held media for your phone like downloads, mobile ringtones and even book reviews. Plus you can search the archives of Entertainment Weekly for almost any article ranging in categories from Pop Culture to Photo Galleries, to their annual lists which include such top ten lists as the hottest American Idol performances ever, most memorable gay couples even before Brokeback Mountain to the most embarrassing sex scenes in the movies. The magazine has been publishing since 1990 so it has chronicled the rise of the star director, star writer, star-producer and the hyphenates -- actor/producers, actor/directors, actor/writers etc. And it's seen the rise of HOLLYWOOD USA and HOLLYWOOD WORLD where popular culture seems to impact every aspect of our lives from how we live to the clothes we wear to the food we eat to the cars we drive. Don't miss their LISTS -- who's who in various categories like the "IT LIST" to the "POWER LIST" to the "ENTERTAINERS OF THE YEAR". 
Indispensable guide to what is happening in movies,television,books,and popular culture. Comprehensive,witty,well-written and,of course,entertaining 
I love this magazine and I look forward to getting it in the mail every single week, unless if the last one was a double issue. Then I have to wait another whole week, which can sometimes be painful. I love the reviews and the magazine is funny, fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies, TV, music, and DVDs. The onlt complaint I have is lately they don't have as many reviews for urban releases 
Health Magazine is a publication that gears its articles toward a wide array of health- related issues and concerns. When I came across a copy for the first time, I picked it up to read with a degree of skepticism. I thought it would be a magazine exclusively about nutrition, but that turned out not to be the case. This magazine does spend some time talking about healthy eating habits, but this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this magazine. The editors of this publication talk about all sorts of health topics, like mental health, relationships, parenting, physical fitness, etc. Because of this, Health has something that will appeal to almost anyone who reads it. This magazine is divided into five main areas: Beauty, Body, Fitness, Mind, and Food. My personal favorites are the Mind and Food sections. I like the Mind area the best because it's the one where I usually find articles that are most relevant to my own health concerns. Here, you can learn about useful things like how to reduce stress in your work and in life, how to deal with problem children, and other informative topics. To a lesser extent, I also like the Food section because it includes some very interesting recipes that show how you can spice up ordinary, routine meals for little cost and minimal effort. If there is one thing to criticize about this publication, it would have to be the fact that it is primarily geared toward women. The Beauty section, for example, is focused almost entirely on feminine concerns, with advice on makeup, eliminating wrinkles, etc. Some of these articles could, of course, be applied toward men but they are mostly centered on woman and the models used in the photos throughout most of the sections of the magazine are female. On the flip side, however, my criticism will prove to be an asset for women, many of whom will find this magazine very useful. Still, in spite of this small criticism, Health is still a very good magazine for all to read. Remember- this is not just a nutrition magazine. The importance of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs comprises only a small part of the publication. The remaining sections of the magazine feature some very useful articles on mental health, relationships, disease control and prevention, healthy cooking, etc., making Health a good publication with articles and columns that anyone can relate to. 
I have been reading Health off and on since I was in high school in the late 1980s, and overall I love this magazine! The articles are usually rather interesting, and there is always at least one long article that I find relevant to my life or curiosities. However, there are times when the topics/articles border on resembling Cosmo and Glamour rather than really being related to health. Overall, I recommend Health as a great read for entertainment purposes and a great reference for health-related issues, but don't always expect nobel prize winning research data in every article 
Oftentimes business and econ professors will recommend that there students read the WSJ everyday. That is a terribly waste of time as the Journal is far too longwinded to be of value to busy executives. Businessweek actually provides very quick and incredibly easy-to-read pieces that give you what you absolutely need to know to get a good intuitive feel for trends and news in the business world. The Business Outlook Column by James C. Cooper alone is worth the price of the magazine. Seldom do economist write in such a direct and easy-to-understand style. Furthermore, BW is a great place to pick up ideas on where business has been over the last quarter or so. It is definitely not cutting edge, for that you need to go to daily blogs. However, it is probaly the best print source of business news 
I know the shipping is supposed to take 4 - 6 weeks but it has been nearly 10 weeks and i dont even have one issue in my mail box... they said they mixed up the address though i keep getting other stuff i order perfectly fine to my address. The magazine service should work a lil better. The magazine is a good one but the one star was for the poor service. 
Detailed, useful information - every week. Also well-balanced - not afraid to criticize businesses where appropriate 
There seems to be a great deal of psuedo business magazines. I like the Business Week is hard hitting, and features excellent articles. I always several articles a week in this publication that are worth my time to read. Many publications dummy down business and make it too simple leaving out important details, nuiances that are important, and just assume that the reader isn't intelligent. Articles are written that are concise, generally filled with the data to support their conclusions. I found this magazine invaluable in business school because it kept me up to date, and often ahead of my classmates. In the business world I find that this magazine is one of the few that keep me informed and well rounded with aspects of business I am not familiar with. I really feel this is a worthwhile publication if you are looking to stay on top of what is current and important in the business world. 
This is a pretty good magazine. The niche is that it goes out every week and thus it is the most current business news magazine out there (if you compare it to Fortune, Forbes...). I always find 3-4 interesting articles there, but don't expect to read cover to cover 
I've been a BW subscriber for 8 years now, and if the magazine stays as good as it currently is, I see at least 60 more years of subscription. BW is a very well balanced magazine focusing mainly on business trends and headline news. A majority of their articles are extremely informative, well written, and objective. If there is an opinion piece, it is clearly stated as "Commentary". I enjoy the "Economic Viewpoint" where it alternates between right and left wing economists (Hubbard for Rep., Tyson for Dems). BW is also forward thinking in writing about trend analysis and disecting what the future may bring. There is a good snippet of International business. A couple weaknesses of the magazine: -Tech You column. The guy writes about the same category of gadgets over and over again (mainly PDA what not). I would like to see more articles about HDTV, laptops, desktops, software, etc. Tech You appears to be written for either a road-warrior or a technophobe. -Personal lifestyles section. Seems like the magazine is catering towards a more upscale crowd, writing about exotic vacations and expensive wines that only either a very rich person or a very debt prone person could afford. I also find the magazine to be weak in covering the retail sector. I'd like to read more full articles about companies average consumers deal with on a weekly basis. The Kmart/Sears deal was largely overshawdowed. All in all, if I could only choose one magazine to receive, this would be the one. 
I have subscribed to Business week for two years now. I suggest that people accusing them of having a liberal agenda reread their past issues. Bush was receiving criticism for not being Republican enough! His deficit spending is the most clear example. Other fiscal conservatives, such as George Will, have criticized the President. Does that mean they are following a liberal agenda? I think not 
I can hardly wait for my next copy to come. I look forward to the magazine more than any other magazine I get and read every word in it. I save them for years and go back to them as they have relevance years back when new books come out. They give me pleasure with every read. Even though I can read them on the computer I just love having them around the house so I can pick one up and see what was around months ago or years ago. I'm a real fan. I can't say enough. I've given them as gifts to all of my friends that join audible. I buy books I might not have noticed without reading about it in audiofile. Thank you, thank you, thank you. What more can I say. Keep them coming. 
I admit it; I'm addicted ... not to the heavy stuff, but instead head-over-heels in love with audiobooks. And they have found a friend in AudioFile, a truly wonderful magazine that informs addicts like me about the latest trends, equipment, books to hit the market. The down is that it's only published every other month. I voraciously read it both on line and the "hardcover" edition that arrives in my mailbox. Some other reviewer complains that the reviews are nothing more than recaps. While they are short and to the point, I disagree about the contents of the reviews. They're exactly what I'm looking for: an overview of the book, not an in-detail New York TImes type review. If I want to learn more I then check with Amazon to see what others feel. While I still purchase and read print books (they'll never go out of style!), I have found audiobooks a great alternative to curling up with Agatha Christie. And, hopefully, AudioFile, along with my newfound addiction to audiobooks, will continue to prosper and grow. It's good to be in on the ground floor 
For lovers of audiobooks, Audiofile Magazine performs a valuable service. While I read book reviews from many sources, Audiofile Magazine is the only reviewing service I've found that provides feedback on the quality of the listening experience. Highly recommended 
As someone who loves to read, and finds it increasingly difficult to find time to do so in a time crunched world, I rely on Audiofile magazine to point me in the direction of what will provide a great listening experience.It provides reviews which I find are very accurate and illuminating. Through the magazine I have been guided to many authors, narrators and subjects that I might previously have been unaware of, or overlooked.The review section covers several different categories of book in every issue, describing content, and highlighting excellence.Sometimes the authors of a book will be interviewed with the review of a narrators work side by side. This I find fascinating. The articles give an insider look at an ever changing industry, and "connect up the dots" of this fascinating, mysterious world by discussing anything and everything that is audiobook related. Audiofile is the only place I can count on to recieve accurate information about this growing and rapidly changing industry, that remains largely unsung elsewhere. It is a highlight when I recieve the latest copy, go through it and plan what I am going to listen to next.It has led me to many works I might never have considerd and helps me follow my favorite narrators, audio related events etc.Whether you are an everyday listener or an industry professional,AudioFile is a lifeline! Life would be a lot duller without this irreplaceable guide 
For lovers of audio books, this is a must have magazine. The reviews are thorough and interesting. I have seldom found I review that has not been helpful. f I enjoy the articles and even the ads. The magazine has a service whereby they send you, via email, upcoming reviews. I am a knitter, handspinner and weaver and audio books are my constant companion. It is important to me to have a source of reviews. There is nothing like renting or buying and audio book and not liking it. I highly recommend this magazine 
As someone who reads a lot of magazines and who is a left-liberal, I remain a stalwart supported of The New Republic. This despite the fact that, yes, they supported the Iraq war. Their crucial failing in that enterprise was that they assumed that Bush would work with Democrats, etc., and actually get the job done. It's easy for the anti-war left to bash them after the fact, but at least you can say they take the moral and ethical high road: they've been advocating for military intervention on humanitarian grounds for years, and even if, as in the case for Iraq, they made many mistakes, the fact that they represent an American left willing to intervene on non-self-interested grounds is important in and of itself. Many people have suggested TNR has steadily moved to the right under the tenure of Martin Peretz, but they remain committed to some of the most important issues to American liberals: universal health care, gay rights (their most conservative editor, after all, was Andrew Sullivan, an openly gay Republican) and progressive economics. Jonathan Chait is probably the best political-economics journalist working in the US today. Yes, they are decidedly centrist, and yes, they feature a large number of conservative writers, and finally yes, they are unapologetically pro-Israeli on Middle East issues which puts off the American college left, but their analysis is top notch, their reporting incredibly insightful, and despite no longer being the "in-flight reading of Air Force One," they remain indispensable for anyone wanting to understand the Washington elite. On the arts front they're even more consistent: Stanley Kaufmann's film criticism is insightful and top-notch; I wish they had more of Robert Brustein on the theater, though at least you have to give them credit for being a national magazine which still has a drama desk. Jed Perl is often insufferable in his art criticism, but he's very smart and engaging. Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor, is the one I like least, as he's given to long, wincingly verbose pieces (rarely on books), but he's one of the eminences grise of American literary criticism. More engaging and controversial is James Wood, whose occasional fiction reviews are absolutely worth reading; again, I rarely agree with him, but he's indispensable. Just because you agree with The Believer more doesn't make them more interesting to read. Basically, TNR is great for anyone who's actually interested in what's going on and wants to be intellectually challenged; in the end, I rarely outright agree with their writers, but unlike The Nation or Mother Jones, they don't bother preaching to the choir, and the writing is much better (in the end, I only kept my Nation subscription going for Arthur C. Danto's occasional art pieces). 
I have through the years read many different pieces from the TNR . They almost always were of high quality, credible and convincing. There are exceptions. They not so long back published a piece by Tony Judt on Israel which I found ill- informed and outrageous. In general however they have through the years been fairly understanding of the special dilmenas that Israel faces. Editor Martin Peretz is a strong Israel supporter although he takes a quite dovish Shimon Pereslike line. The book- reviews of TNR are outstanding, a recent example being Robert Alter on Amos Oz masterpiece-memoir " A Tale of Love and Darkness." As for TNR supposed shift from liberal left to neo-con right that would seem to me a quite logical and reasonable response to the changes in American political reality through the years. What seems to me however extremely important is that the pieces in TNR are generally written with a kind of basic decency, and without the overpolemical ugliness of some comparable journals. 
I'm a liberal, and I've been a devoted reader of TNR since the 1950s. And yes it is a liberal magazine. It does excellent investigative work. And I have not noticed much of a change in its politics in the past 50 years. Some of the other readers have mentioned TNR's stand on Israel. This stand has been there since Martin Peretz took over the magazine in 1974. Peretz never supported the right wing in Israel, but he certainly supported Israel's right to exist. And I remember one of his early exposes of Time Magazine for its very one-sided reporting about Israel. In this respect, TNR is very different from The Nation. But does TNR support Democratic candidates? Usually, but not exclusively. TNR did not like Dick Nixon, of course. After Peretz took over, TNR supported Carter for President in 1976. Next, I think it backed John Anderson. Carter's foreign policy obviously started to annoy TNR. TNR always backed Clinton, Gore, and Kerry. And it backed Kerry even though it was a little suspicious of his attitudes about Israel. As for the war in Iraq, TNR initially took Colin Powell at his word about weapons of mass destruction and reluctantly backed the war for this reason, after which it felt cheated. If you want a left wing antizionist magazine, you won't want to even read this. You'll want The Nation. If you want a neoconservative magazine, you'll want to read this, but the magazine you'll really want is the Weekly Standard, or maybe Commentary. Anyway, I always read TNR, and I highly recommend it to everyone 
My new favourite magazine! Beautiful photos, smart and entertaining articles, fashion, art, exclusive celebrity interviews... all with a dog focus! Cover models range from Paris Hilton and Tinkerbell to Virginia Madsen and her dogs. Thanks to Modern Dog I now know how to throw a dog-friendly cocktail party (complete with hors d'oeuvres for both two- and four-legged guests) AND actually get my dog to come when she's called. Definitely worth checking out 
I have been subscribing to this book magazine for over 2 years. During that time, I have been exposed to so many wonderful books and authors that I never would have heard of. Not only does the magazine cover fiction and novels, but it also covers other genres and interests as well. In every issue they interview a book club and the club shares what books they have loved or not liked so much. They also have a "have you read" section which interviews people on their favorite books. So if you want to increase your exposure to books you otherwise may have missed, this magazine is perfect. It's also enjoyable reading in and of itself. Their reviews have also saved me from reading books that I really wouldn't like after all. 
This magazine has it all, and you don't have to leave the comfort of your living room! Smart, savvy book reviews...highlights on different genres such as the crime novel or non-fiction books...spotlights on successful book clubs...and outstanding feature articles on classic and modern authors. Everyone from John Steinbeck to John Cheever. Reading Bookmarks makes me want to revisit old books and try new ones; It also turns me on to authors I've never "tried" before. Recently I started reading books by Amoz Oz because of the feature in a recent issue. And I would have never given authors like Jodi Picoult or Kevin Brockmeier a chance had I not read the reviews of their latest. In addition to all the great goods on books, the magazine is one of the best looking mags on the market--great color, fantastic pictures, and an easy-to-read layout. One of the best things about Bookmarks is its straightforward and intelligent approach to books. It doesn't simply sensationalize bestsellers or cater to the Hollywood version of authors and their work. It focuses on the book, the author, and the joy of reading...and this is perhaps what Bookmarks Magazine does best.Where else do we just sit and enjoy something for the sake of enjoying it? So forget navigating traffic and finding a place to park at a bookstore--just give Bookmarks Magazine the time it deserves and learn what to read next 
This magazine is a great way to get a book club to focus on what to read next. Basically the magazine is a collection of all sorts of "Best" lists to suit every taste. The "Selections" page starts with a collection of "staff favorites" highlighted with a one-(don't bother)-to-five(rarely given, a timeless classic) star rating system. There's a digest of 27 "best books 2005" lists in a recent issue, a page on the Whitbread awards, a selection of current and upcoming books, reader recommendations, new in paperback, a year in books (e.g., 1981)etc. Coupled with very little advertising, it's great! 
I'm a recent subscriber to Bookmarks and I'm finding that it is a very enjoyable and very well edited magazine. Bookmarks reviews books by compiling reviews and ratings from multiple different sources and by citing the representative insights from those reviews. A summary of the book and overall review and corresponding score out of 5 stars is then given by Bookmarks. This has the obvious advantage of giving you many different people's opinions about a book along with those of Bookmarks itself. The selection of books reviewed has a strong focus on literature with a good coverage of the key science fiction, crime and non fiction books. In addition to reviewing newly released books, each issue explores a thematic topic such as ancient greece or the french revolution and finds experts to nominate the best books on that topic. There are also articles that detail famous authors, giving a good discussion of their works and places to start reading if you are interested in knowing more. Key best sellers lists and book prizes are also covered allowing readers to keep abreast of which books are being formally recognised. This would be a great magazine for keen readers or book collectors and particularly those people who collect modern first editions. The less time you have to read the more valuable this magazine will be at pointing you in the right direction. 
I just received my first issue of Bookmarks and absolutely loved it!!!! It has SO much information in it, and I even went right online to order some back issues! I do wish it was a monthly magazine, but I'm very very happy with it -- definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to read and is looking for reviews of both popular books as well as books you'd not ordinarily hear of 
I am so happy that there is a market for this magazine. The mantra of the book is dead people is thwarted by this pub. I scribble down scores of books each issue that I have to read and it reawakens my interest in books that I missed when they feature classics. I buy more books than ever now thanks (or maybe no thanks) to this magazine 
I stumbled across this little gem almost by accident, and what a surprise it was. The sheer breadth of subject matter could span half a lifetime. We never forget the lessons of our youth, and each issue, like a great short story, will separate you from the mundane and transform the way you view literature. And yes, you will return...time and time again. Are you trying to decide whether to devote your summer to reading Anna Karenina? Perhaps it will ignite in you a love for the Great Russian novels, providing fodder that, like all firm foundations, could change the course of your life. If it's the modern classics that you're interested in, one almost can't help but think along the lines of John Knowles. Life marches on, and we choose whether to change or be changed. Much is out of our control in this world, but what we choose to read is not. Regardless of your personal paradigm, you will find much of interest in this cleverly constructed work. While the idea of a Holiday gift might seem obvious, why not consider surprising and old friend with a subscription? Does your friend really need that Springsteen coffee table tome? Even as a belated wedding gift, it would no doubt be appreciated. Don't stand around in bookstores, Starbucks in hand, flipping through page after page anymore...Oh, you don't do that, huh? No, neither do I. Just subscribe now. I hope to find one in my mailbox soon. -Timothy McPhail, Avondale Estates, GA 
Bookmarks Magazine Magazine review by Viola Beauregarde, 11.13.2005 The Fractured Chronicles [Blog] http://violabeauregarde.blogs.com Out of all the literary magazines I have read over the years, Bookmarks Magazine is one of the finest. It offers the reader not only an in-depth listing of the newest literature in print, but upcoming books, books to movies, and old favorites. Each book is rated from the best to the worse review in order to give a broader and more balanced perspective. This also includes critical summaries, which are invaluable. The insightful author studies give the reader a concise and informative glimpse at the author behind the literary work. If you only subscribe to one literary magazine this year, spend your hard-earned money wisely and get Bookmarks Magazine. Believe me, you will not be disappointed 
I find it to be the least biased among PC computer magazines. Unlike most of its competitors, computer reviews are typically supported by objective benchmarks. This magazine does not generally cover PC components such as cases, fans, and motherboards. But it is immensely useful for their reviews of brand peripherals (eg, LCD, printers, graphics cards) and computers 
This magazine will aid you in your quest to become a PC guru, however it tends to be ad swayed in its reviews of products, software and hardware. You'll learn alot from this and other PC magazines... from basic firewall configuration, to knowing how to install missing files in sub-directories you never knew existed. Good for the PC enthusiast who want's to improve his 'skills', and for the techie who needs advanced PC info. The info is good, the reviews tend to be weighted by advertising, so take reviews with a grain of salt and look for reviews for that particular product, software etc, elsewhere 
Have enjoyed PC Magazine since the early 80's...an invaluable source of information and insight...a must read 
PC Magazine is the largest, most expensive magazine of its kind, but it is well worth the price. I used to have a subscription and found its detailed product reviews helpful in making decisions about purchasing PCs, hardware peripherals and software. These reviews are among the most extensive I've come across in computer magazines. It is not a magazine for those who are technically illiterate, since its intended audience seems to be those who might call themselves "techno geeks". And it is not a magazine - like Wired, for example - that seems interested in covering the future of PC computing. Nevertheless, it is a fine magazine well worth its subscription price 
Just received my first issue and it is just wonderful. Great ideas and recipes which everyone can enjoy. Looking forward to more issues 
Before I begin, there's one thing you need to know: I can't cook. I have skills that can't be beaten when it comes to heating stuff in the microwave, and I can use the toaster oven to, uh, toast things, but that's it. No whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals for me, which probably makes me the only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine. This should say a great deal about just how entertaining EVERY DAY WITH RACHAEL RAY actually is. Of course, as you might expect, I like Rachael Ray. It REALLY would be weird for someone to buy this magazine if they didn't cook and they also hated Rachael, and I'm not THAT weird! However, although this is ostensibly a cooking-centric magazine, I'd argue that it really reflects Rachael's ATTITUDE and personality. Her enthusiasm, love of a wide variety of food, and adventurous spirit shine through on every page. By all reports, Rachael was very hands-on in developing this magazine, and it shows. To those who ask why they need to read a Rachael Ray magazine, since Rachael is all over television these days (most recently with her own syndicated daytime talk show), chew on this: Rachael isn't taking over the world by accident. She's obviously doing something right to be dominating both the Food Network's daily schedule and the bestseller lists (for her ever-increasing line of cookbooks). People just can't get their fill of her! So, what exactly is her secret? I think it boils down to these factors: a combination of approachability and charisma, which are key ingredients of superstardom (think of talented-yet-friendly stars such as Tom Hanks or Shakira). Add to that a dash of optimism mixed with a spirit of adventure, as witnessed on my favorite Ray show, "$40 a Day," in which she explores a new tourist destination each week, trying to eat well on an insanely low budget.  But what about Rachael Ray in magazine form, you're wondering? Well, in my opinion, EVERY DAY WITH RACHAEL RAY appeals to all tastes by brilliantly translating her unique appeal from the tv screen to the printed page. As I mentioned earlier, I probably won't be cooking anything from the many recipes included in each issue, but I still like checking them out. Each recipe includes a picture of the finished product, and the recipes have lots of variety and creativity... Yum-o! And some are so simple, like sandwiches or salads, that I get the feeling I might actually be able to attempt them if I really wanted to (See? Rachael's "can-do" attitude even gets through to the kitchen-incompetent!) The travel articles and the short pieces (about a wide range of topics such as buying cheese, making mistakes in the kitchen, etc.) are also fun. But, as a Rachael fan, I especially enjoy the parts of the magazine written by, or about, Rachael. One nice feature is a Q A in which readers can send in questions about Rachael which she personally answers. As someone who has participated in a lot of "celebrity Q A's" online in the past, I love these chances to get to know more about someone famous who you may never meet in person. In fact, the only reason I haven't rated EVERY DAY WITH RACHAEL RAY "five stars" is because I'd like to see even more Rachael-related photos and articles in each issue... how cool would that be?! Also, I'm hungry for more interactivity: perhaps some food-themed Sudoku, or some search-a-words. But to be fair, this is a relatively new magazine, and all great magazines need time to sort out what does and doesn't work. And so far, EVERY DAY WITH RACHAEL RAY has hit the ground running and is off to a great start. I was actually the first person to buy the very first issue at my local bookstore when it came out (I got lucky and happened to be there as they set up the display), and I've looked forward to each new issue ever since that day. If you like Rachael Ray, you can't go wrong here... start spending every day with Rachael Ray and "take a bite outta life." Even if you can't boil water! 
Spa Parties and T-shirts that say "Delish" are very much a part of Rachael's magazine complete with pullout recipe cards and travel features. The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine. The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes. Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms. What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze. This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The "Ask Rachael" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1). What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? "What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?" I'm always intrigued. If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting. ~The Rebecca Review 
After buying the first issue of Rachael Ray's new magazine I knew I would have to subscribe after only a few pages. Those pages were not only gorgeous and glossy, but chock full of fun facts, great shopping places for food and utensils, and of course tasty recipes that you do want to make. I have collected way too many cookbooks and food magazines that stand untouched because when it really boils down to it, its all about the food and some of those books and magazines did not deliver in the end. I have since bought some great cookbooks and pay more attention to what's inside then what's on the cover. Rachael's recipes are not pretentious, and they certainly are interesting enough to engage the reader into trying them out. I've made several of the dishes from the Lemon cream pasta, Mushroom pizza, salmon and pasta dishes, to Sangria frozen pops and some great grilled food. Rachel provides shopping lists of standard pantry ingredients and fresh produce to buy, so its easy to see what you all ready have and what few things I can pick up on my way home to make a fun meal. I love making her recipes and adding them to my repertoire, as its nice knowing you can make a certain dish and its even nicer to whip up an easy dinner or lunch using this magazine. I also adore the fun articles you can find about restaurants, cheese diaries, wine tasting, outdoor grilling and foods for events. The magazine is really a beauty to read and has more information and entertainment than advertising. I cant stand the regular food magazine I used to get that were half full of Cat litter advertising, along with page after page of useless products screaming in my face. I hope this magazine will continue to bloom because I absolutely adore it and I intend on keeping every issue instead of tearing out recipes like I used to. Great buy and something you can cook out of with the feeling of a mini cookbook but simpler and prettier 
There is SO much in each issue of Everyday with Rachael Ray! This is really the best food magazine (and so much much more!) in a long time. It's just a shame it isn't every single month : 
The magazine was passed on to me by someone after she finished with it. I subscribe to 2 other cooking magazines and I have to say Rachael beats them both by miles! Her meals are easy but also interesting, her writing style is fun and the weekly planner is a great idea. I will definitely subscribe! (and let my other 2 subscriptions lapse 
I am a huge fan of cooking magazines and when this glossy mag hit the stands a few months ago, I picked up a copy immediately. At the time, I wasn't too familiar with Rachael Ray as I had never seen her cooking program. But since Everyday found its way into my hands, I have become a not so secret Ray fan. The premiere issue was amazing - I read it from back to front and was pretty impressed with the content - recipes, ideas and food stories. Of course, I had to try the recipes to see if they were any good - and wow - I was truly amazed at the quality and variety. From this issue alone, I made Ginger Salmon, Overstuffed Chicken Pitas, Greek Style Tuna Salads, Posole (I was always looking for a good recipe for this - and this is the best one I have come across not to mention easy), Beef Wellingtons (simple) Chicken Curry (my son says this is the best chicken curry he has ever had) and more! Some of the recipes are from her many books, but there is lots of new stuff here as well. I really like the dessert recipes by contributor Silvana Nardone. Other cooks are featured here as well - so this is not strictly a "Rachael Ray" magazine. Every issue comes with a handy 'mini cookbook' complete with grocery list - you can take this right out of the book and bring it to the store. Talk about convenient and clever! Wow! It boasts a week of 30 minute meals. Very nice for the busy home cook. I also enjoyed the travel/food stories. In this issue, Rachael shares her favorite New York spots. As I am planning a journey to New York this spring, I will certainly have to investigate a few of her recommendations. Overall, I am seriously impressed with this magazine - great content, supremely easy recipes, good variety, lots of pictures, nice layout and a sense of fun that is absent in many of the other cooking magazines. I ordered a subscription and the second issue was just as amazing! I recommend this magazine to everyone who loves to cook - not just those looking for cooking in a flash. I'd give this magazine 10 stars if I could 
I think there can be no better magazine value of its type. I have particularly enjoyed the recipe section, but it is all good. Why didn't somebody tell me? 
I have received "ladies'magazines" for many years and keep coming back to GH. I am 57, single, have little reading time for pleasure and little interest in or time for walking through stores to keep up with products, new ideas, etc for women. I don't' even spend much time on the net for this information. I like GH's reputation for quality (GH Seal of Approval and assessment of products), the price (it requires ads to sell the magazine at this low price in today's market; GH passes some on to the customer by keeping the subscription cost low), and the timeliness and the variety of topics interesting women. And I enjoy the tidbits of celebrity information without excessively intimate details of their personal lives that have no impact on the reason I enjoy their performances/talent. It's the only "overall" magazine of this kind that addresses things I want to know about on a consistent basis without becoming the same every month, which is something I don't like about many other periodicals. I also enjoy the ads; otherwise, I would never know of foods, beauty aids, cooking techniques and equipment, fashions, shoes, books, etc. I look forward to getting my GH. When topics greatly interest me, I cut and file them. Also, when I finish with one while flying, I can always find another woman who is happy to take it on their flight. As some of the youngsters say today, "It's all good! 
Good Housekeeping has it all - wonderful recipes, health tips, diet tips, articles, parenting advice, product reviews - and delivers it with the warmth of a beloved next door neighbor. Buy a subscription in companion with Woman's Day for the best in women's reading. 
Ok, so you wrote in forever ago and will probably not see this... Size 8-16 in USA clothing is equivalent to about size 16-32 in the UK. As you can see, this magazine targets the average American woman 
Reminded me that the subscription was up for renewal, I renewed it, and that was it 
I enjoy reading the articles and stories in the Cat Fancy magazine. Being a new cat owner, and not very "cat smart," I have found that I have learned a lot of valuable infomation reading this magazine each month. Each month they introduce different items available for cats, such as grooming aids, comfort products and new fun toys. Buying the magazine through Amazon.com is a big savings over buying it through the magazine itself 
One of the better weekly magazines that covers world affairs from what's on the news around the world to some pretty obscure things like Imelda Marcos' shoes to life in China, a society not at ease with the globalisation of the world. TIME did a really good article on how Google has allowed itself to be sensored in the name of finance, makes you realise that Human Rights don't exsist when the dollar signs are being totted up! The UK edition pretty much follows the USA edition, it's an easy read, and what's good is that every now and again TIME puts out a special edition which often follows a theme, the last one was on Christopher Columbus. Worth getting a subscription, also you can do what I do, when you've read a copy, give it to your local dentist or Doctor for their waiting room 
My "Time" magazine arrives like clockwork weekly in my mailbox. I am always happy to see it there among the bills and the junk mail. I recently dropped cable TV, and "Time" fills in all the gaps for me, and gives in depth reports on newsworthy events that are just glossed over on the local stations. From the big world events, including special reports like the recent Tsunami tragedy, to what's new in the science and industry world, the economy, the latest inventions and gadgets, to sports and people in the news, and TV, movie and music happenings, there is something for everbody. It's a periodical that lets me catch up on the newest terminology in the cyber world to the newest star in the hip-hop world. It amazes my kids that I would even know this. The articles seem well researched, are well written, interesting and very informative. Find out if the video game your child is playing is suitable for their age group, who we lost this week, great quotes and much more. There are excellent photos and even the letters to the editor seem more insightful and informative then anywhere else. From Politics to Fitness, from Food to Technology..it's all here. The price is right for a subscription. You get your money's worth, and will have the world at your fingertips. Keep up the pace with "Time"....Laurie 
The best weekly news magazine on the market, Time also gives science and technology updates, movie reviews, some celeb news, and provocative articles on world trends. Well worth a subscription, especially if you don't have time for the nightly new 
After subscribing to Natural Health for years, the magazine recently "went to the dogs". I now subscribe to Alternative Medicine instead and it is like Natural Health USED to be. I love it. The information is accurate and the topics are all very interesting 
Alternative Medicine does a terrific job of explaining the benefits and uses of complementary (alternative) therapies -- which have been used for centuries, throughout the world. The articles are thoroughly researched and unbiased. You'll learn how to build your body's resistance against cancers, allergies, and auto-immune diseases - and what the true causes of these illnesses are. It also provides very helpful information for parents regarding their children's health, including autism and other learning disabilities. It also includes interviews and biographies on homeopaths and other complementary medical practitioners and the successes they have had with their patients. It's truly a practical guide for anyone open to exploring how to get healthier and stay that way without toxic side effects. You'll learn something new in every issue - I know I do 
I love to look at the vibrant and diverse layouts and search for ideas to incorporate into my own pages! Almost every page has at least one layout or technique (including the advertisement layouts). I find that I get more ideas from these magazines than I do from how-to booklets, etc. There is a great section every month where several people use the same supplies to see how many different looks can be achieved. They give a glimpse of brand new products in the trade as well as give practical ideas for the budget conscious 
I have been scrapbooking for more than five years, and I my style is rather simple. However, I recently found myself in a rut, and I began wishing I could do the fancier pages, so I began receiving Creating Keepsakes. Although I still have no desire to do a two page spread that takes 5+ hours, this magazine has been great at inspiring me to try new things, as well as just giving me ideas for both scrapbooking and stamping, in just the first three issues of my subscription. They do a fairly good job of showing the expensive way to do a page, as well as the more economical. Additionally, there are product reviews and recommendations. I typically buy most of my supplies from at-home parties, I found a very helpful recommendation for a silent eyelet setter. Some of their articles are geared towards the more advanced/ambitious scrapbooker. For instance, a recent article explained how to use certain computer programs to augment photos. The results were beautiful, but this was just not up my alley. They also recently did a spread on the scrapooking rooms of some of their staff, and I was very, very jealous! I may never have any award-winning spreads, and I probably will never use my computer to augment my pictures, but I know my scrapbooking will be more creative and better looking due to this magazine 
I love this magazine,it is my favorite of all of the scrapbook magazines out on the market. It has an all-around appeal with great and creative ideas, ways to delve into your creative mind, tips and tricks, and of course beautiful layouts to look at. This would make a great gift for a beginner or advanced scrapper. 
This magazine is great. My daughter and I are doing projects together out of it every issue. It's great also because it is training us to be creative on our own, and to try new things. We also do these singing lesson Cds together- "Voice Lessons To Go" by Vaccarino- really fun, and have been doing Berlitz beginning Spanish Cds together. We love choices beyond sitting and watching TV

If you are looking for information about Ferrari automobiles, this magazine is definitely one of the best ones around. Each issue is packed with detailed information on new models, older models, special editions, etc. in addition to racing information, serial number histories, etc. You will also find a wide range of incredible pictures. Highly recommend this to anyone who has any interest in Ferrari! 
Wifey and I are always so excited when the new Dwell arrives in the mail. This is the cutting edge of architecture and design magazines, and we are always looking for new ideas and trends in its many colorful and well-photographed pages. A truly great monthly mailer 
Dwell is a unique (in my opinion) magazine and I like that. Unlike many if not most magazines that revolve around home design, this magazine does so with environmental concerns in mind as well as style. And as someone who appreciates the less is more mantra, I like the fact that the magazine shows off abodes that are small yet spacious. Like in the April 2006 issue where Aloft in the Forest, where an urban yet forest feel loft style home on a compact lot are shown. Using easy and affordable ideas for the interior elements. Yes, the magazine has ads, but to their credit they must screen clients so that what ads are there, fit the style of the magazine. No fluffy dust catching junk 
Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like "Wallpaper" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about "Dwell" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful "Marketplace" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place. This magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller, but I like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well. Individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes, thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference. The photography is superb. If you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers, this is a great, reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design. Highly recommended 
"The Wall Street Journal" is one of the most-in-depth business journals available. It is an interesting blend of current events and insightful analysis of prevailing and sometimes not so apparent trends. The quality of reporting is generally balanced and professional. Although every newspaper has a political orientation of one sort or the other, the Wall Street Journal news reporting is largely free of politics, making it a good source of unbiased news and information for most people. However, its editorial section is conservative, although thankfully the editorial section is a tiny portion of the whole magazine. The journal has a lot of insightful business news that every manager at any level should find useful. The reporters cover the various topics in great detail and with knowledgeable perspective from all sides. They are not afraid to cover corporate transgression with rigour and honesty. The journal also covers various other topics such as personal finance, special reports, business profiles, interviews, commentary, market and news of note for management personnel. 
Question: Is there a better American English-language daily anywhere? Answer: no. The Times (of London) is a great and venerable paper, but not easily available in the US and focused on a different reality. The New York Times is an institution in its own right, better than WSJ on foreign affairs, and much more complete paper. But the Wall Street Journal is as good as it gets for a daily newspaper reader in this country with a business bent, an appreciation for an unfailingly high standard of writing and editing, and no particular interest in 'soft' topics or the New York cultural scene. This is one very crisp paper. The last time an article got to wordy was back in 1967 and that writer's body was never found. Just kidding. But it would be a convenient myth for explaining WSJ's disciplined tone. In the 'Personal Journal' section, I routinely find articles that reshape some aspect of my personal (usually financial) life and habits. Sports news is heady and analytical. For example, as I write this review we are in the thick of the American and National League Championship Series. Today's reportage does not tell me who won and lost last night and why. Instead, the 'On Sports' column is called 'Base Instincts' and explains why so many third base coaches end up as managers. In short, apart from the players they are the most important guy on the fold. Across the page, the 'By the Numbers' column is called 'Praising Pitcher's Parks'. It asks why temas that play in pitcher-friendly parks do so well in October. As of this moment, I still don't know who won last night. But I know a lot more about the game of baseball. Best of all, you can generally avoid the pricey subscription if you're willing to use frequent flyer miles to subscribe. One memorably off-kilter film moment had its protagonist emerging from his tent and declaiming, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.' 'Never smelled napalm and don't hanker after the carnage. But I can say that the sight of my Journal in the driveway every morning in its little blue bag is an oddly comforting experience. Buy it 
Excellent (detailed, timely, and unbiased) source of business information; editorial page, however, is strongly slanted towards the conservative side 
'The Wall Street Journal' it seems to me has the most sane and persuasive political writing of any major daily American paper. Its editorial writers are outstanding, and provide generally great insight into world news. I read I must admit this paper occasionally and selectively, searching out the pieces that most interest me. I am simply not the person who really follows closely the business and economic news the WSJ provides. One small criticism is that I have never liked the format of the paper. I just do not like the way those very thin columns look. But this is of course usually more than made up for by the quality of their content 
I read the WSJ, Financial Times and NY Times on a regular basis. The reporting in the WSJ is great -- well researched, comprehensive presentation of facts, broad coverage of issues of the day. The articles in the WSJ make painfully apparent the shortcomings of other media outlets in the U.S. that are content to present competing spin. I trust information found in WSJ articles in a way that I would never trust the pathetic presentation that passes for reporting at the NY Times. The only negative of the WSJ is its editorial page. I am a big believer in capitalism and free markets (I own my own business) but I abhor the nasty editorial page that consistently sells out the true believers to push a crony capitalist agenda. For opinion I look to the Financial Times and the Economist 
This newspaper is far superior to TV news. It does articles in depth and has nuggets of amazing news stories that you will not find anywhere else. It is a window on the world of news, business, finance, medicine, science, travel and politics. In addition to the print version, WSJ also offers an internet version 
Of the printed daily newspapers, WSJ is easily the superior in just about every aspect that really matters. NYT has a lot more and better photographs, but they are best viewed on a computer screen. There's not much to argue (regarding the relatively conservative editorial page) in this review that hasn't already been written; and one more center-right Midwesterner's recommendation is not going to be of much incremental value. However, as an investor and consumer I can state that WSJ and its website have been the primary source of credible information about businesses, law, finance and consumer products. Anybody that works for a living, has a mortgage or has a long-term savings plan would benefit from reading the WSJ as often as possible. There's simply no substitute 
The WSJ has always been required reading for business people and finance wonks, but in the past several years the whole thing -- reporting, layout, editorials -- has been overhauled and the result is one of the best general newspapers in America. First of all, business, economics, finance, etc. are extremely important to everyone whether their profession involves these things or not. Everyone's lives are shaped by these things and it is important to understand them. Second of all, a thoughtful couterpoint to the "liberal media" has long been lacking and the WSJ editorials fill the need ... read both the WSJ and the New York Times every day and you will likley hear two, thoughtful but opposing sides of all the major issues confronting our nation and world, from which you can begin to develop your own independent view. I cannot recommend strongly enough that everyone subscribe to and read the WSJ every (week) day 
magazine arrived approx 10 weeks after ordering - that was Ok - just need to spell that out in original order - my daughter kept looking for the magazine... 
My wife and I have found this magazine to be both entertaining and educational. It always helps to see what other parents have done in certain situations to better prepare you for yours. The articles provide some wonderful information that is useful in everyday life. We would recommend this to all new parents 
I just ordered my own subscription to Parents Magazine because I was reading it over at my younger mother-in-laws all the time and I absolutely LOVE it. I even ordered the Sleep Sheep I saw in there. The thing people need to remember is that it is aimed at mothers aged 18-34. There are other magazines out there for older mothers that I'm sure us younger ones would find uninformative and biased. Every magazine has a demographic goal. I honestly LOVE this magazine. I'm 24, and a stay-at-home mom and my husband works at an electronics store. We are by no means upper class. But I still find their tips on saving money and bargain buying VERY helpful. For those who are older, you might want to try babycenter.com for tips for older mothers. 
I was given a subscription to this magazine during my pregnancy and have gaining a lot of knowledge on the baby world from it. I enjoy the read and have picked up a lot of great ideas from it 
I started receiving Parents while I was pregnant and I will be renewing my subscription soon. Parents is a great magazine for new or experienced parents. It is a wealth of information and advice about raising kids young and old. Great magazine! 
I HAVE BEEN RECEIVING PARENTS FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. EVERY MONTH I LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE NEW EDITION OF PARENTS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF USEFUL TIPS AND THE EMERGENCY GUIDES ARE VERY INFORMATIVE. I ALSO LOVE THE YEARLY INFO ON EVERYDAY TOPICS FOR EACH AGE GROUP. OKAY I DO FIND A LOT OF ADDS BUT I HAVE SEEN WORSE. I SUSCRIBE TO CHILD,PARENT, PARENTING, BABY TALK. BABY TALK AND PARENT ARE SOME OF THE BEST OUT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Beautiful magazine! Excellent articles and lovely pictures. I really enjoyed reading about the Bronte sisters' home in the last issue. 
A beautiful magazine - This one's a classic! Not to be missed by all anglophiles. 
This reaqder is a true Anglophile and wants this new,year old magazine to survive. Judging from the amount of advertizing it receives, I'm not sure that it will. Each edition brings decorating features, some English recipies, homes for sale, and descriptions of all manner of things English. Written for North American readers, it is a delight 
great pictures so good looking,i having been getting it for 20 years ,great price. i wish these boys could say at my house in Palm Springs,Ca. for a month or longer, they could be house boys. 1-760-288-7545 anytime 
FRESHMEN is a magazine for those who like their men on the youngish side. It possesses the same quality as MEN magazine, but not quite the husky nature of that publication 
I've been a subscriber since right before the days of Bel Ami. I've never regretted a single issue, nor the investment. 
Ever since I owned the magaines I thought how cool a magaizne full of naked guys. I have to say that I am glad that I already orded the magaiznes agai 
I've had previous subscriptions to this magazine and I have to say that its most entertaining in many respects. The fiction keeps you reading, guy's first times are always interesting, the interviews are informative...oh, and then there's the hot guys (all perfectly legal) showing all their worth. A great mag for anyone that can appreciate the beauty that is the young man 
I cannot believe Amazon is selling this mag! What next...Falcon videos in K-Mart? I mean, I am so not complaining! These boys are bitchin'! You will not regret this purchase, I so promise 
Harp is the best music magazine out there. The writing is top notch and I love the photography and design. I have spent more money than I care to mention on cd's I've read about in Harp and have NEVER been disapointed. I highly recommend this magazine to anyone who is as obsessed about music as me 
If your are interested in travel, culture, dining, society, or photography, this is absolutely the magazine for you. Each issue is chock full of travel ideas that go above and beyond the boring tourist traps, and digs deep into a destinations culture and individuality. Also, giving you vivid photographic illustrations that the National Geographic Society is world renowned for 
Unlike other travel magazines, this one provides a lot of useful information while holding advertising to a minimum and not interlarding promos throughout the articles (Rick Steves, are you listening?). Each issue contains a wide variety of material about diferent parts of the world and the information provided for featured destinations is truly useful. In other words, the information is trustworthy, the first prerequisite for a travel magazine. Production quality is excellent; this is a magazine you will leave out on your coffee table. Surprisingly, the website stinks. Not even subscribers are able to access many of the articles on line, and the weekly A-List of special deals is unimaginative and seems to focus on useless extravagances (lots of spa get-a-ways) 
National Geographic Traveler brings content rich information about the locations covered, the culture of the people, places to stay for many budgets, along with breathtaking photography that makes me want to leap right into the pages. National Geographic also has excellent travel packages (I prefer land, no cruises for me) to destinations rich in archeology, history, ancient culture, as well as newer destinations with respect to where to stay. If you love seeing the beauty of our planet, this great magazine will definitely help you make your decisions a lot easier! Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of If God Hears Me, I Want an Answer and Stop Being the String Along 
Very interesting with nice pictures. Gives a lot of information for travelling all over the world 
I love travel mags, and this one is like the magazine Adventure, but adds more of a tourist bent without losing the original edginess that is adventure writing 
I subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the Conte Nast Traveler, and I'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire. This magazine has articles about places not about (as one other reviewer wrote) articles about martinis, fashion etc. It also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers. It probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one 
I've subscribed to this magazine for years I've saved every issue. Whenever I'm planning a trip I always refer to my collection of Traveler for information about my destination. It's easier than ever to find the articles because an index every article ever printed is listed on their web site. The articles are very informative and the pictures are awesome! I love it 
This magazine is ideal reading for anyone who demands a broad perspective and deep analysis about any current topics related to international foreign policy. Years ago, I subscribed to the magazine and now, as an International Relations grad student, I use articles in The National Interest to address my areas of concentration. The pieces are useful to me because they are so in-depth. I appreciate the pragmatic approach of the writers as well as the wealth of information the editors ensure are featured in each issue. I particularly like the Reporter-at-Large feature and the recent "Conversation with Henry Kissinger" segment. Top-level experts on foreign policy like diplomats and intelligence officers, well-known policy-makers, and prestigious journalists make The National Interest an exciting read. The broad and varied views enhance my studies. I like the magazine because the centrist perspectives distinguish this magazine from the many others I read like The Economist, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy. I find that every article offers level-headed reasoning; no sound bites, no bumper-sticker clichï¿½s. The articles offer conclusions that allow me to develop my own informed opinions. For anyone who wants to be up to date about foreign policy, and who wants to develop well-documented opinions from those who have been on the "front lines" of world affairs, this is the magazine I recommend without reservation. 2nd year Graduate Student at the Yale University, McMillan Center of International Studies. 
Car and Driver is the quintessential automotive publication. The format is very user-friendly and the reporting accurate, leaving sensationalism to the other publications. That being said, the magazine is not what it once was. As others have updated their style and photography, most notably Motor Trend, Car and Driver soldiers on with its now-familiar format. And the recent departure of Brock Yates, second only to David E. Davis in automotive journalism god-ness, the magazine moves in the wrong direction. Time will tell whether Csabe Csere (the editor) can restore its preeminence 
As your grandfather told you, you can't always judge a book by its cover. Nor, these days, does the title of a magazine always clue you into the content that begins on page three. Refreshing, then, to page through an issue of CAR AND DRIVER and find that --still crazy after all these years--it's *still* about cars and drivers. Don't get me wrong; the usual suspects do appear month after month in columns that dig into one aspect or another of the auto industry. And there are those ubiquitous pages of adds from the major auto producers and the after-market confectioners of shiny things to bolt onto them. But everything else is about cars and the people who drive them. To be slightly more accurate: about cars, written by and for the people who drive them. A fair number of pages are given over to the exotic and performo varieties of the four-wheeled and the fast. But CAR AND DRIVER displays no embarrassment about majoring on the cars that the rest of drive. Or might drive or might choose never to drive, given due attention to the reviews put into the hands of drivers like this reviewer by drivers who drive for a living. 'Wanna' know what Madonna drives? Buy another magazine. 'Wanna' know what's new in the '07 Chevies, Fords, and Beemers? That would be CAR AND DRIVER 
Car and Driver is the best of the automotive- related magazines. It features numerous road tests and comparisons designed to help the consumer make a better buying decision. Most of the articles in Car and Driver deal with statistics. The magazine features several vehicles each month with loads of information on each one. They cover things like the engine size, length and width of the vehicle, acceleration rate, braking distance and much, much more. The facts are presented in an unbiased, informative way. The writers don't try to promote one car over another. They want you to know the basics and then decide for yourself which vehicle best suits your needs. In addition to individual ratings, Car and Driver also features head- to- head comparisons among vehicles in a specific category. For example, one months' featured article might be on minivans. The magazine will select a group of vehicles from this category, rate then on a scale from 1 to 10 in several categories, like handling, brakes, ride, engine, styling, etc, and then tally up the points and announce the winner. This is very useful to a potential buyer because it allows him/her to make a side by side comparison of similar vehicles. car and Driver doesn't necessarily push one brand over another because even though their point system might result in one vehicle rating superior, there are specific qualities, options, and features of certain vehicles that will make them more appealing than others- even those that rate slightly higher. The only bad point that I can come up with for this magazine is its lack of personal stories. Car and Driver is an informational magazine, with very little in the way of stories with a personal touch. If that is what you like in a magazine, then Car and Driver may not be very appealing to you. It is basically a magazine full of facts and figures. Car and Driver wants you, the consumer, to know the facts: The average distance needed to brake, the acceleration rate, the engine size, and other vital statistics. It doesn't waste its time talking about people and their cars. It concentrates only on the cold, hard facts. If you are looking for information on your next new vehicle, Car and Driver is the magazine to buy. I read several automotive magazines and they all have something to offer but Car and Driver is my favorite in its genre. It has all the data you need to make an informed buying decision. 
In USA, you can't find a better magazine. These is the magazine if you want to know the technical details on a simple but professional way, and at the same time, has great humor. Just check that the other magazines are loaded with C former talents 
If you want to cook delicious food - get this magazine. If you want chic menus, articles about wines, diets, food trends, etc... - this magazine isn't for you. I've decided to quit wasting my money on the others with more polished style, but terrible tasting recipes. Those other magazine get thrown away each month. But, each every Taste of Home issue has a permanent spot on my cook book shelf 
I first came across Taste of Home Magazine about 10 years ago. Some friends of mine were quite the experimental couple who loved to try out new recipes. As the recipient of tasty appetizers, dips, and desserts, I asked them for the recipes. It was then that they shared this magazine with me...and I've been a subscriber ever since! Each magazine features several special features, as well as mainstay departments such as Potluck Pleasers, My Mom's Best Meal, Getting in the Theme of Things, and Super Snacks and Appetizers. Arguably the best part of this magazine is their clip-and-keep section of recipes which feature color photos of the dish. Just cut out the recipe, and ouila! it's ready for your recipe box. Other information-packed sections include Ask Our Food Editor, Touring Country Kitchens, Ted's Toothpick Contest, Lively Leftovers, and more. Each issue also features a recipe contest to win cold, hard cash. Some of the great recipes that are in the most recent issue include: Swiss-Stuffed Porkchops Open-Faced Turkey Tacos Spinach Shrimp Fettuccine Coffee 'n' Cream Brownies Cucumber Potato Salad Asparagus Chicken Crepes Hearty Jambalaya Barvarian Strawberry Pie and many more. Besides being tasty dishes, one of the great things about the recipes in Taste of Home is that they don't call for some exotic ingredients. Rather, they feature ingredients that can be found in any department store...even if you live in an out-of-the-way rural area! Some of the recipes aren't exactly "quick", which is why I give it four stars. There are certainly quite a few quick and easy recipes, but there are also some that take quite a bit of prep work. If you're looking for a magazine with mostly quick recipes, try their sister publication, Quick Cooking (I subscribe to that one, as well...and actually like it better.) Taste of Home has NO ads (amazing!), so it's nice that the magazine is chock full of recipes and information--not fillers and ads. This magazine also is very "country", so if you're looking for something trendy and cosmopolitan, this mag may not be for you. But if you like down-home country cookin', you'll likely love this magazine 
Imagine making a Beehive Cake or a Honey-Citrus Iced Tea. When looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors. You will be cutting out a lot of recipes! In fact, I'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing. There are 16 pages of recipes in a "card" format. The Favorite Meal section and Cooking for One or Two is always of interest. It shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included. There is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens. Then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary. Add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough. The "Men Who Run the Range" section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country. These are ideas and recipes from real cooks across America. One time I looked in the "Does Anyone Have...?" section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items. After sending her a small box, she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers. It is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe, there is an address where you can mail the item. I recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers. This magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country. You could also be a Field Editor and share your recipes, cooking tips and other ideas with the home-office staff. You could literally end up in this magazine! Some of the delicious recipes I've been clipping from this magazine include: Grilled Sirloin Steak Crispy Fried Chicken Herbed Seafood Skewers Chicken with Rosemary Vegetable Cheese Tortellini Grilled Turkey Burgers Beehive Cake Honey Citrus Iced Tea Tonight I made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved. I think this magazine inspires me to cook more and I have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore. Now I'm dreaming about the Pear Crisp with Lemon Sauce and the Raspberry Cheesecake Pie. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
I have been receiving this magazine for over two years and of all the magazines that I receive this one is my favorite. I just wish it came out monthly. The recipes presented in this magazine are really tried and true recipes. I have had great success from most of the recipes presented. Although this is a bi-monthly magazine it is well worth the wait 
I love this magazine and in each issue, I usually find one or two recipes that my friends and family will be asking for again and again! Each issue is made up of recipes contributed by cooks from all over the country, so you know a couple of things right away: 1) the recipes are doable by ordinary folks in ordinary kitchens using utensils and ingredients most people have readily at hand, and 2) this is some good cooking, because these are family recipes that in many cases have been handed down across the generations. Even though most of these recipes are made entirely from scratch (even the cakes!), they are still remarkably easy to do (and I say that as a confirmed fumblefingers in the kitchen! If I can cook these receipes, anyone can!) This is not the kind of fancy pants cooking you're going to encounter in many of the more high-end cooking magazines, this is American (or Canadian) food prepared the way most people cook in their homes. And it makes for some good eating! Each issue is built around a theme or two, usually recipes that use a featured ingredient announced in the previous months' issues, like strawberries or chicken. But there are lots of other recipes that feature the full range of dishes, from breakfast to dinner, to budget cooking and grilling, to late night snacks and children's parties. In every issue there is also usually a section that focuses on healthy foods and lists the nutritional content of the featured dishes. There are also dozens of handy kitchen and cooking tips in each issue, I have learned things I never would have thought of doing and it has made my cooking life so much easier. And the best part? No ads! Taste of Home is like belonging to a recipe club that sends you a beautiful, glossy, picture-packed magazine very month! If you like home cooking, get this magazine, you'll love it! 
I get my copies of Taste of Home as hand-me-downs. I probably wouldn't subscribe to it myself, but I can see that it is a very good magazine if you like hearty home cooking and don't already have a broad repertoire of tried-and-true recipes to rely on. Taste of Home presents family-friendly comfort food; most of the recipes are submitted by readers with a note about their origin. Each issue is packed with over 80 recipes and contains no advertising. Most dishes are made from scratch (or as close to scratch as anyone does anymore) with readily-available ingredients and easy preparation. If you are looking for trendy or exotic food you won't find it here, but you will find a seasonal selection of roasts, stews, casseroles, soups, salads, appetizers and party food, simple but lively vegetable side dishes, and easy-to-bake desserts. You will like Taste of Home if you like to try new recipes and have fairly traditional tastes in food, or if you want to try cooking (nearly) from scratch but don't want to slave for hours in the kitchen. Check out the publisher's web site to see featured articles and the recipe index for the current issue 
I love the TASTE OF HOME magazines for many reasons. There are color photos of nearly every recipe so you get an idea how the final product should look. The recipes are easy to prepare because most are made with ingredients the average household has on hand. (Nothing weird, wild nor exotic!) The paper is of a heavy, water-resistant quality. Each issue contains LOTS of recipes but not so many that you're overwhelmed. Most of the recipes are submitted by regular people, not concocted by a professional chef wearing a tall hat. And I like the homey-style. Readers can share their family's favorite meal blessing (Grace). There are cutesy stories about little kids. And although I never can find it, my aunts LOVE the toothpick contests. The best part....NO ADVERTISEMENTS!!! I can't tell much difference between the Light version and the original Taste of Home....so I usually buy both!!! If you like to cook and enjoy a quality collection of recipes, you will love the TASTE OF HOME magazines! Blessings from MenopauseLady 
PSM is the only mag i know to ever admit they underrated ICO. I quite agree with their ratings which seem to escape most of the commercial influences. The whole package doesn't glitter but it is very effective. It takes me hours to read it unlike some other mags that won't keep me busy fore more than a bus stop interval 
Fantasy magazine has been around since 1949, and is in my opinion one of the better SciFi and fantasy mags on the market. It has a proven track record of publishing outstanding short stories, novellas, and novelettes that have later gone on to win Hugo, Nebula, and dark fantasy awards, which brings me to the 2006 June issue of the magazine: The June issue features an outstanding and very creepy novella entitled Hallucigenia by Laird Barron. I predict an award for this chilling novella, which will be just another in a long and esteemed list of award worthy tales from Fantasy Barron's story could be classed as a Cthulhu Mythos tale, although no where does the author allude to H.P. Lovecraft's works. It is simply that the recurring theme is a recognizable one to us Mythos fans. Highly recommended reading, and worth the subscription price. 
With its cheap pricetag and thick size, Fantasy Science Fiction is definately one of the best. It splits it pages into fantasy science fiction stories and novellas with a few common columns between (book reviews and strange facts). If you write fantasy or science fiction, pick magazine up 
Once upon a time this little magazine serialized The Gunslinger. I cannot give it any higher personal praise than that. But if you still need some convincing... The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction is the gold standard in its genres (which are broader than the title might initially seem to suggest--there are all kinds of Fantasy and Science Fiction--and this magazine also features some horror from time to time). What Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock's Magazine are to mystery, F is to, well, F I have met some of my favorite authors in the pages of this magazine. Most recently, I read a great short story, "Finding Beauty," by Lisa Goldstein. I intend to read some of her novels as soon as I can get my hands on them. The excellent review by David Roy below covers the nuts and bolts description of this magazine pretty well, so I won't repeat what he has so concisely said already. I will however, make a nod to Charles de Lint's excellent column. If you are a voracious reader like me, you will find it of great worth and use. I encourage you to not only check out, but support Fantasy and Science Fiction. This great publication is a jewel and well worth the money and time spent reading. Fantasy and Science Fiction gets my full recommendation 
What sets FSF Mag apart from the other digest-sized magazines that deliver speculative fiction is that FSF chooses, almost every month, to transcend the genres it represents instead of remaining within the definitions and boxes that limit the other magazines. There don't seem to be any hard and fast rules concerning the stories that appear in this magazine except that they be really well written, and compellingly readable. The stories run all over the fertile woodland of Fantasy and Science Fiction and every month hold many surprises. There really hasn't been a magazine this satisfying since the old Twilight Zone magazine. In the end, it isn't about hard science or speculation about what might happen (in a scientific way). This is a magazine about stories for people who love to read them 
Ohhh, FSF, whatever would we do without you? Don't you ever change 
Fantasy and Science Fiction Magazine is full of imaginative stories every month; I have never been disappointed. The stories range in length from blasters to novellas, so no matter how much or little time one has, there is a story that will fit in. The authors are professionals who deliver well polished prose time after time. There are rarely stories at the extremes of the fantasy or sci-fi genres. I have never read about elves and dragons or about the workings of a space ship in any issue. The stories are about people, relationships, and all the strangeness we call life, as is the case with all good writing, not dazzling displays of scientific blather 
This was actually a gift for my husband, but he was very pleased. He had been getting it gratis and loves the magazine. The order was filled expeditiously and we have already received copies 
The Wine Spectator is the ultimate guide to wine. As a magazine, it gives trusted up-to-date information on wine and related issues. I look forward to each issue and always find something interesting. I would definitely recommend this periodical to all wine lovers 
There's certainly a lot to hate about Wine Spectator - and, for that matter, Wine Advocate. Many winemakers decry the existence of both magazines, and usually lay the blame entirely at Robert Parker's doorstep for making the 100-point rating system an industry standard. Wine Spectator's scores have gotten better with time, as have their articles. They've shied away from California "glitz" and have looked more into food. Also, the education classes that they list on their website are becoming increasingly more helpful. Apparently they listened to much of the criticism and worked toward creating a more respected magazine. I think they've done well. 
The Wine Spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you're rich or that you soon could be, all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine. There's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy, pleasing publication. But if you're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor. Just enjoy the game. That game includes a travelogue of the world's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself. This reader is in it for the long haul - I hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the Wine Spectator is my companion along the way. My job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like France, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and - of course - Northern California. But with wineries now in 49 of the USA's fifty states, what's *not* a wine region these days? On those business treks, I find myself out for dinner as often as not. It's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a Pinotage in Capetown, since only South Africa produces this varietal, or to opt for one of Argentina's persuasive Malbecs because they're just *that* good. We're not talking wine snobbery here, just satisfaction at the margins of life's all too margin-less journeys. If this sounds like your game, the Wine Spectator may be a worthwhile investment. Even if not, consider splitting a subscription with a colleague. That's what I do. At half the price, I get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy, beautiful, pleasant magazine. Life can deal you worse 
I subscribed to WS for a couple years in the late 90s, and loved the magazine. It keeps a balance between reviews of wines both new (which is the main emphasis) and older vintages, and background stories on vintners and so on. The writers are almost all very good (and I'm a professional writer myself) -- only one of them do I dislike and he doesn't review the wines. Both the wine connoisseur and the novice can profit from reading this publication. I only dropped the subscription because I moved and the collection, no issue of which I wished to discard, was occupying more and more space on my bookshelves. Now I subscribe to the online edition so I can check ratings before I buy a wine. The WS, in addition to Parker and other reviewers, perform an essential service for critical consumers who can't otherwise judge whether a bottle is worth the price asked. And we need WS and Parker and all to tell us when the best reds are ready to drink -- some really great ones are not mature for more than a decade. I drank the highly rated Chateau Canon 1982, for which I'd paid over $100, 17 years after harvest, and my group could tell it wasn't ready -- still closed down. Sure enough, if I had read Spectator carefully, I'd have picked another bottle for that occasion because they said it wasn't yet mature. Robert Parker has the reputation for being more influential for high-end wines, but Wine Spectator's scores are generally pretty close to his. And they review a broader spectrum, as noted by other commentators below. WS will often steer you to excellent buys for under $15, or even under $10. If you get only one of these per month, or steers you away from a very overpriced bottle, the subscription (about $50) pays for itself 
Not only do we love the 2 issues so far that we received of Wine Spectator, but they came earlier than the 6-10 week leadtime that we were told it would take 
Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products, wine facts and education, and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year, so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material. Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine, and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings, so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80, you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis, there is often contact information, such as the name of the winery or web page, so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase. To help shoppers find the wines in each issue, Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition, because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference. Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like "World's 100 Greatest Pinot" or "The 50 Finest California Reds". Consumers are attracted to listings, and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like "This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet" or "Greatest German White Wine Ever". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues, but it could get annoying to some readers. In spite of these few annoyances, Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good, very convincing, and very persuasive. They really know wine, and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine. 
As Mr. Michael J Edelman points out in his comment, this magazine is helping people talk about a lot of things they don't quite understand. I mean what's the point of knowing that a wine has certain characteristics if you can't actually notice them? Still, Wine Spectator is the Best wine magazine today; it has the best articles and the best staff. If you want to be, as Mr. Edelman states, a yuppie blabbing about "cherry and oak", go ahead and buy it. If you want to know about the ongoing discussion about cork vs plastic, buy it. If you want to know a little more about wines, buy it. What I truly recommend is, buy the subscription, buy lots of wines and try them, understand your tastes. Once you can tell one wine from another without looking at the bottle, you can talk about wine 
I got a free subscription to this newspaper and I am thoroughly enjoying it. The Olympics coverage was wonderful along with the color pics. I like their editorial pages too and my favorite part is the Life section. I love the color pics and the celebrity news and the reality TV news synopsis. I used to only read this paper when travelling or on vacation. Now I am reading it daily and they may have a subscriber for life 
as a subscriber to the washington post and a reader of usa today i can say that usa is just alot more interesting. sure it may not have all the details, but it give enough information without making it boring. the color is great as are the graphs and feature articles. it may not be good for a buisnessman looking for information but the usa today is just fine for everyday news 
This paper offers a wonderful broad perspective, and great national coverage. Doesn't take too long, but always has plenty to read. Every american should read this paper. And every adult should check out the "New Sex Now" dvd 
Ever since USA Today started publishing, it has been made fun of. And can't understand why. This a great paper that gives its readers the facts that they need to get though the day. One of the main reason that I enjoy USA Today it has little advertisements,unlike my local paper. It also give me news from everystate. USA Today is great paper for readers looking for just the facts and not alot of fluff 
My "Time" magazine arrives like clockwork weekly in my mailbox. I am always happy to see it there among the bills and the junk mail. I recently dropped cable TV, and "Time" fills in all the gaps for me, and gives in depth reports on newsworthy events that are just glossed over on the local stations. From the big world events, including special reports like the recent Tsunami tragedy, to what's new in the science and industry world, the economy, the latest inventions and gadgets, to sports and people in the news, and TV, movie and music happenings, there is something for everbody. It's a periodical that lets me catch up on the newest terminology in the cyber world to the newest star in the hip-hop world. It amazes my kids that I would even know this. The articles seem well researched, are well written, interesting and very informative. Find out if the video game your child is playing is suitable for their age group, who we lost this week, great quotes and much more. There are excellent photos and even the letters to the editor seem more insightful and informative then anywhere else. From Politics to Fitness, from Food to Technology..it's all here. The price is right for a subscription. You get your money's worth, and will have the world at your fingertips. Keep up the pace with "Time"....Laurie 
The best weekly news magazine on the market, Time also gives science and technology updates, movie reviews, some celeb news, and provocative articles on world trends. Well worth a subscription, especially if you don't have time for the nightly new 
This is simply one of the best movie magazines on the market. You can always be sure to be updated on the latest movies and dvd releases, and it's nice that the crew of Empire doesn't take themselves too seriously; the articles are well written but keeps the humour intact as well, where other movie magazines seem to be too keen on showing how intellectual they are. Unfortunately it's rather expensive here in Denmark, but it's worth the price 
No question. If you followed ALL movie magazines, even the sci-fi and fantasy spin-offs, quick VHS magazines (remember those!) then you should also remember about the time BATMAN premiered (what great movie hype!) Empire Magazine ran its first issue and then the great BATMAN #2 issue and we have not stopped collecting since, nearing issue 200 now as I write this, it has been a good one so far and I am sure will keep up the same pace for all new to the greatest `non-digital' monthly pages on the planet, I urge young and old alike to start collecting and reading now. Empire has the best letter editor quick reply page, best movie news section that is fairly reliable, some interesting actor introductions, then the SOLID MOVIE REVIEW SECTION that is pretty much the most effective appraised segment in any magazine on any planet and to think that it is about films makes it all the more better. Film personality, editorial and staff movie trivia segments, inside scoops, Questions and Answers about how much is a bottle of milk, Empire helped get us closer to these people who made us so happy at the silver screen and to that I have Empire to thank. The spine quotes at the side that can win us a T-shirt, the new DVD section (I lived for the old VHS one) your designers really knew what made us young impressionably men do in the bathroom with Michelle Pfeiffer in the mid-section, thanks for that also and I end this review by saying that if there was any magazine in the world that I would like to write for, I would give my left one for these people. This is truly amazing film work... and yeah, it does leave Premiere magazine to go pound on sand. Try it 
This magazine seems too perfectly tailored to me, much the way I felt when I discovered Harry Knowles' Aint it cool News. As a monthly movie mag that pushes near 200 pages an issue, this blows the nearest US genre mag (CFQ, 6 issues a year, 80+ oages) to hell, and contains little to none of the 'snobery' of most domestic movie mags. Great mag for the movie lover who likes healthy doses of fun and humor with sincere film anaysis 
I have read this mag thru and thru, and for some 20 + years now it has continued to be at the top of the crop. It is the most superbly laid out and designed magazine with excellant content,that I have ever seen. To be totally honest, I would much rather read and browse this any day over "Print" magazine. This is almost like a graphic design book, that just gets published every 2 months where the best designers in the world are given each about 30 pages to just go nuts on. I found it deep in the stacks of the university library one day and have been hooked ever since...also for those of you who can read/write japanese, german, and english you can have your pick while reading.. 
Computer Gaming World has been around since the early 80's and it's always been the best in my opinion. A lot of people think their reviewing style is a bit harsh, but given the price of games and how much garbage is released, you really can't afford not to read reviews before buying. Computer Gaming World gives concise, critical reviews that explain exactly what is good and bad about games on the market. Highly recommended 
I have been a subscriber to CGW for about a year and have been pleased with their coverage of PC games. In addition to having a healthy dose of advertisements, the typical issue includes previews of upcoming games, reviews of released games, and a hardware commentary section. The articles are generally well written, even with some humor thrown in. I plan to remain a subscriber and would recommend the magazine to anyone who plays computer games 
This is the best PC gaming magazine you'll find anywhere. It covers the lastest games and hardware. A bonus, the issue comes with a free demo disc every month. Although PC games are fading out of the picture, XBOX is a good way to keep them alive. This magazine covers everything you need to know. It's the best thing to do if you want the most out of your PC. A good choice to start with is this. Get this magazine, your won't regret it 
This publication is very imformative and helpful for the beginner or hobbyist 
Seventeen was probably the most unappealing magazine to me when I was in middle school. I bought my first issue in July 2003 because they didn't have my beloved Cosmogirl at the airport. I don't know who the editor was back then, but thank goodness for Atoosa. She changed the magazine around. Seventeen has nice clothing ads. Most of the clothes are affordable things which happen to have a universal appeal. Although sometimes the outfits featured are quite boring, there won't be something you don't like. The makeup is alright too, nothing special except for the occasional bit. The serious stories are great, nothing too overpowering, and plus there are warnings for graphic stories to keep your mind at peace. For you occasional magazine readers, the best time to buy this magazine is for back-to-school. Age reccomendation: 13-19 (seriously. 
I have been receiving Relevant since the first issue. Every issue I receive I look at, read a few of the articles, and head right to the movie review and CD review section where they rate not just the music lyrics, but the quality, and spiritual content. That has been useful (as oposed to the traditional avoid all secular music OR the gamble I used to take at the CD store). The look and feel of the magazine is quite nice - I know that these folks are doing their best to create an inticing and fresh look to the pages - and it is working. Honesty about Christianity is important to me - and after spending a couple of issues with Relevant - you will see it is to them. They have a freshness in wrestling with struggles and quetions without quenching the longing for pursuing God in my heart. Lastly, there seems to be many people out there who just want to make money off magazine subscriptions. I appreciate the cost of this mag - they keep it affordable which means it fits in my budget...something that less and less is able to do these days 
RELEVANT is a magazine that reaches our culture, rather than form its own Christian sub-culture. While the magazine is definetly aimed towards the "20-something" demographic it still can speak to all generations. It covers the most important topics facing our world today, Christian and secular. It also covers books, movies and good music. Interviews include, Cameron Crow (director of "elizabethtown" "vanilla sky"), Bono of U2, Lovedrug and Copeland. The writing can be somewhat shallow at times, but overall isn't bad. The magazine fit finish is second to none in the Christian magazine market, with thick glossy pages and colrful, thick covers, although it could be longer. This is surely one of the best Christian mags out there today. If your a Christian and are ready to move Christianity into the next generation, I would highly recomend this magazine. If you like music I would recomend PASTE magazine, its is owned by a Christian and covers some of the most excellent music around today 
I think that begs the question on most everyone's mind in America. Pop culture is king. Few know it, but everyone believes it, whether consciously or sub-consciously is the question. Relevant magazone shows us that God doesn't only exist in the front pew of a church anymore. The progressive Christian, the one you can find at The Door on Friday and Saturday nights in Deep Ellem Texas, that is who this mag focuses on. But don't think that you are required to have tatoos to read it. This month's issue (July_August2 2005) that I just bought has an honest and real article on pre-marital sex. But I am not typing now to review that particular article, go to my chat forum if you want to see that. In short, this mag has been long awaited and it sky-rocketing its way up the ropes in modern america. Why? Go read it and find out. Jesus is alive 
In a day and age where the twentysomething Christian feels like they could either live as a real person in society or cut themselves off into the small little world of Christian culture, Relevant Magazine alone realized the true approach of being "in the world, but not of the world." The magazine builds up and encourages the twentysomething Christian by speaking our language. From spotlights on Christians in the worlds of entertainment, sports, etc., to devotionals written by some really great Christian writers, to suggestions on handling sex, money, and the pressures of being in this generation, to reviews of books, movies, and both secular and Christian music. This is a magazine for the everyday Christian who finds himself in this world we're in and, rather than play a seperatist monk, wishes to reach out and be relevant to the world that he/she is supposed to spread the gospel to 
Relevant Magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith. Many of the reviews are of secular artists, the spiritual content or message (or lack thereof) of the music they sing, films they make and books they write. They also review Christian artists, many who are on the fringe. This is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things. If you just want a 'youth-oriented' Christian magazine with Bible studies and how-to's you'll probably be disapointed 
If you're short on time or just looking for new ideas, this is the place to turn. Mailbox magazine offers interesting ideas, printables, and many other items. It is really worth the money 
Paula's magazine is wonderful...unlike what one of the reviewers wrote about the recipes being bland. They are all from Paula's cookbooks, new recipes or from her friends. NONE are bland...they are Pure Paula and all have the wonderful southern flare she is known for. I have been fortunate enough to meet Paula in person and was at a recent taping of her new t.v. show Paula's Party...this magazine is just another wonderful extention of her many talents! 
I like Paula Deen's cooking, and find that I prefer to order my magazines through Amazon because they send me an email update when my subscription is really about to expire, so I can choose to renew, instead of flooding me with 6 months' worth of letters in the mail saying "RENEW NOW" or else, you'll miss an issue. Invariably, I never missed an issue, but I certainly OVERpaid too soon by sending in subscription cards and renewing too early when I may not have wanted to. 
Great magazine. But don't subscribe here. You can do it online at her website or tear out the order form in a magazine and it will cost 50% less 
I watch Paula on TV as often as I can and the magazine gives another chance to get her recipes and see all the things she is up to. I really enjoyed the two copies of the magazine that I have read Keep up the good work and Thank You for being a real down home southern country girl. Me too 
I was getting utterly sick of all the other so called "fitness" magazines that were 70% makeup and clothing ads. I found Oxygen and Womens M and i'm hooked on both. You don't see the same old boring exercises just stacked in diffrent routines like the other magazines. You get a lot more variety. And I love the special editions on "butt" and "nutrition" etc 
Obviously "ugly" comments below were written by the uneducated with uneducated guesses and assumptions. I LOVE this magazine. There are awesome workouts, great meals and great stories to inspire one and all. Yes, it does cover fitness/figure competitions, but it doesn't mean everyone has to look like that or get their bodies to that level... it's a magazine for inspiration... to look at the physcially fit (who are only able to look like that when they compete, not 365 days of the year as everyone knows is unhealthy... even those who do compete). yes, the downfall to this magazine is all the supplement advertisements... but what is a magazine without advertisements? Every magazine you look at has some form of adverstisements and since this is technically the "bible" of fitness, there are going to be advertisements tailored to supplements. i will admit, I was somewhat offended by reading what the "ugly" had to say. They must've been jealous, because I felt that way towards fitness like they do when I was in their shoes (I weighed 180 at one point on my 4' 11" frame), or upset because they didn't do the research on this magazine and just assumed it would be another girly magazine with false info on how to lose those last 20 lbs by doing useless no weights exercises or the "as seen on TV" cardio DVDs/exercise machines/gimmicks. Those women are NOT ugly and all are NOT bodybuilders... most were fitness competitors doing gymnastic type routines and only lifting to tone. Weight lifting does not a body builder make. You would have to lift to the extreme, power lift and in the pros take steroids (hence the ugly men-looking women). So... if you want to take your body to the next level... better yet, actually lose some fat in a healthy manner and need some inspiration, please buy a copy of this magazine. check it out. If you're into fitness/figure competitions, well, obviously this is the bible. :) As for the uneducated below, I am competing in my first figure competition in 9 days. Of all the things I have learned through my trainers, most of the supplements you see in the ads are not condoned by them. And contrary to popular belief, we don't all consume protein shakes all day, nor does this magazine say you HAVE to to reach your weight loss goals. And substituting toast with jam for a bagel with cream cheese is just as bad, because you're substituting sugar for fat. Doesn't make any sense. I am one who was overweight and have learned a great deal from magazines like this... every magazine, whether it be fitness, fashion, etc. must be taken with a grain of salt every now and then, because not even the so-called "experts' can agree with what works and what doesn't. Everyone's body is different. Look at this magazine, do the research, make an educated choice 
I am a teacher of students with disabilities and my students absolutely love this magazine. I keep the magazines in my classroom library and the issues of Disney Adventures are constantly being checked out by the students. My students especially enjoy the short articles and comics because it gives them the chance to read, but it isn't too overwhelming 
My 5-year-old loves the magazine. It was easy to order through Amazon. The issues started coming right away 
This magazine is amazing. It has alot of features like interviews, upcoming movies, cheat codes, comics, puzzles, and more things. It also has good color. I started getting them since March, 2002. I still love it 
Kerrang! is by far the most informative rock magazine that has ever been published! I can count on Kerrang! to get the best interviews, be up to date, and get the facts straight from the mouths of the musicians. Its a hard to find magazine in the US, but if you can spare the money it is well worth your dollar if your intereseted in the world of hard rock. They also cover a wide range of bands that the US wouldn't even touch, and are always turning you on to new music with free CDs 
This International magazine should be refered to as the Blue-Book of good metal Music... Forget all of those "Boy-Metal" bands like creed or Linkin Pork...They have quality bands like Soulfly, Messhugha, Machine Head, etc... Plus great book, movie, and video game reviews...(if your into that)The only down fall is the $$ Price $$ but, you get your money's worth 
This was for my friend in jail.I believe he said that he's enjoying i 
Ordered this for my son. Sometimes it takes a while, for the order to reach him in prison, so I'm not sure he has received it yet. Since you wrote and reminded me, I'm thinking it did get to him, as others have been returned 
Good magazine. I don't get it monthly, but have read through them when I see them. I got one issue and they got good articles and HipHop info them. Good hiphop magazine here 
This is a magazine. This is a magazine? Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you can get it for less than $20 an issue (like I do at my local Borders). Excellent quality 
Not Only Black + White is a great Australian magazine, and of top quality. I used to buy it in bookstores here in New Zealand, but they don't seem to be available here anymore. I am not subscribing to it, but I'd keep getting them if they were available in bookshops where I live. I emailed the publisher twice about this, but I didn't get any response. Aside from that, this is a great mag (yes, it has fine art nude pictorials as well as lots more) and one that you would hang on to like a "coffee table" book rather than treat like a typical magazine. It has a thicker cover and pages than normal magazines too. For a magazine, you could almost rate it a 5, but nothing beats a proper book (no advertising, etc), so I rate this a 4. Aside from the photography, it also makes a good reference for page layout and typographical ideas as well, for anyone into desktop publishing 
This magazine is, in my opinion, well thought out. The articles are interesting, relevant and well-written. Good photography. Quality paper. I enjoy reading it and look forward to reading it. Of all the magazines in our waiting room, more patients have had positive remarks on this magazine than any other. I just re-subscribed for my second year and quite pleased. Highly recommend. 
I have been reading this magazine for 3 years now and find it continually creative and insightful. The articles cover a broad range of physical and spiritual topics with clear subject matter. I highly recommend this for any age group. There is nothing offensive or patronizing. I was hooked after one month. 
Spirituality and Health is a bi-monthly magazine that reports on the ideas, the people, and the practices of the current spiritual renaissance. Featuring reviews of books, DVD's, and music, as well as lively columns and interviews, Spiritual and Health Magazine explores the mind/body connection, healing, spiritual practice, science, psychology, and more. Here is a sample of some of the articles featured in this magazine: *Socrates' Seven Spiritual Principles *The Healing Power of Doing Good: The New Science of Volunteering *The Standford Forgivness Project *Qi Vs. Cancer *Lessons From Mindful Corporations. *Recovering From Infidelity *Classic Hymns Cut Through Dementia *Spiritual Literacy in Wartime *How Plants May Explain the Intelligence of Ants Magazine departments include book and movie reviews, gorgeous art and photographic galleries, beliefs from all walks of life and faiths, commentary by Thomas Moore, and more. One of my favorite sections is What Goes On In There, Really? which examines different worship practices. They have profiled experiences like a Pentecostal Christian service, Dances of Universal Peace, Maundy Thursday in Baghdad, Friday Night Shabbat Service, Siddha Yoga Meditation Ashram, and Spotting Elves in Iceland. I've been a subscriber for several years now, and once I sit down to begin reading Spiritual and Health Magazine, it's hard to get up! You never feel like you're preached at; rather, this magazine offers gentle observations on contemporary culture, ancient wisdom, science, healing, personal growth, new discoveries, and spirituality--with breathtaking color photographs placed throughout. This magazine is truly a visual feast, as well as food for the soul 
What can I say? I subscribed to a magazine and now it's arriving. 
I love Discover. Every month it keeps me informed on the #1 reason for optimism about this human race. Scientific, technological progress. Which vanquished disease, poverty and starvation in most of the world and delivered here and now what religion only promised later. It's a good magazine. The main short-coming would be that it tends to be short on text sometimes and long on glossy often irrelevant and insipid photos and graphics. I would prefer a text-only magazine to the pointless illustrations that devour so much of the magazine's real estate. But one must get used to such a thing, to enjoy any modern magazine. TIME magazine got dumbed-down, too, along with most of the others. And for $20 ya can't beat this with a stick. 
I love this magazine because it keeps me up on celebrity gossip, and it lets me know what to wear, where to get it, and where to get it cheaper! I wish that a subscription wasn't so much $ though. I used to pick one up at the grocery store once a month, but they don't sell it in my new state (just moved). I'll keep looking 
ART IN AMERICA seems to have won the vote for most popular periodical on the arts. The quality of reporting of world events, the informed writers who critique and investigate, and the style of referencing used in the articles makes this magazine immensely readable. This is not the most sophisticated journal of art (MODERN PAINTERS and some of the other European magazines win there), but the balance between coverage of reviews in America as well as the international scene is very fine. Ads are well designed and reproduced - even if there are a few too many for 'vanity spaces'. The constant for all of the available art magazines that can stand as a complaint is the overemphasis on New York gallery reviews: New York is not the hub it once was and the importance of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, etc is not recognized by the writers/editors.The exhibitions reviewed are solid in reportage, if unduly weighted to the edgy installation and quirky art. But for the August Issues of the Gallery Guide this magazine has them all topped! 
Just about the best art magazine available now, even the advertisements are interesting. Global view of what is happening in the art scene today 
I tend to buy a lot of fashion and beauty magazines, and immensely enjoy reading them when I have time to relax and forget about my intense and demanding job. I do believe that InStyle is the best one, for me anyway. My favorite feature is the "Great at Any Age" where they discuss a clothing or beauty option and they present how it can look best on women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. I don't know of ANY other magazine that does that so well. I just canceled my Lucky subscription because I was so tired of seeing ONLY clothes that look great on 20 year olds. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against 20s, but a magazine needs to show a RANGE to be useful. InStyle magazine covers fashion and beauty very well, and is full of great tips and information for *everyone. 
In my humble opinion, this is the best magazine for style and fashion advice. Even the advertisements are hip and informative, in terms of fashion and style. Of all the style magazines out there today, this is far and away the best of the best. 
InStyle is my favorite fashion magazine out there. It is much more reader-friendly than Vogue - much cleaner layout, the font is easier to read, and the writing is clear, witty, and less dry. I've been reading InStyle for about 3 years, and each issue never disappoints me. The focus of the magazine is definitely fashion, but there are also makeup tips and celebrity news. The magazine targets a much broader audience than more haute couture magazines like Vogue. My favorite section is "The Look" which highlights celebrity fashion and also has a section at the end that profiles a specific designer or label. InStyle also features many tips and recommendations on beauty products. The best issue of the year is without a doubt in March or April when they do "Best Beauty Buys." After polling beauty experts and testing hundreds of products, they feature the best beauty products in ever imaginable category. I've discovered some of my favorite beauty products through these issues, and it's nice to be able to trust a source without wasting your money on testing out expensive products that don't work for you. It is the best source for getting the most reliable products out there, from hair care products to makeup. I have seen several women at Sephora, clutching torn out pages from InStyle's Best Beauty Buys and frantically searching for the right mascara. I understand that Vogue is an institution now, but InStyle offers a much better alternative, and provides articles that you actually want to read and tips you actually use. 
I'm a bit of a magazine junkie and subscribe to about 15 different magazines (and slowly reviewing them all). In Style is DEFINITELY my favorite FASHION magazine. It doesn't give advice on how to pleasure your man but they do have a few fun articles on celebrities and fashion-related news. The styles they show are so versatile and easy to assemble yourself in real life. In Style offers alternatives to super expensive clothing by categoring some pieces in $, $$, and $$$. I love it because I can afford 80% of the fashion they show, whereas Elle, Vogue, and W are all a little bit "over" my taste. To me, In Style is more affordable and easier to relate to on an everyday basis. If you do enjoy high fashion and $1000 purses, you should probably look elsewhere. In Style offers a healthy dose of celebrity fashion that I need every month, and I really, do do do love this magazine 
From a girls perspective this is a great magazine. I also subscribe to some "harder" adult magazines but I definitly still love this one. Great and interesting articles, nice ads and very sexy pictures 
I believe that every American man owes it to himself to subscribe to this magazine at least once in his lifetime. To feel the sense of entitlement that comes along with regular deliveries of hot naked women to one's mailbox is a true sense of prosperity, freedom, and manhood not to be missed. God bless America, and may God bless Playboy Magazine 
I have been reading Playboy for years and have always felt this magizine has grown with informative information,and of course the great pictures have always been top notch. I cannot think of a better magazine to subscribe to..... 
Who hasn't heard of Playboy? Well, there are many reasons for that. Hugh Hefner's vision for what really matters for a man and how to make sure that you'll have some good time and fun is still unsurpassed. I guess that most men are drawn to the exclusive and high quality photos of usually gorgeous women who are tastefully exposed but not completely. I love this element of teasing and keeping part of them uncovered so you can spice up the entertainment and experience with your fantasies. Apart from the soft-core nudity, Playboy is also an excellent source of interesting information. Each issue has movie and music reviews as well as a short story and objective political commentary. The magazine has humorous parts, editorial, and fascinating news. There is also a 20 Questions feature with a celebrity and a long interview with another famous figure. Overall I am sure that you will love it and have a great time reading each issue. The bestseller "Scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" is additional must read about women and sex. I highly recommend both of them 
For over fifty years Hugh Hefner has beaten his critics with a very diverse magazine. Beyond great pictures, Playboy has been a leader in fighting for rights that we so often take for granted. Whether defending what consulting adults do in private, or how to worship or not to as we please. Mr. Hefner has been there without the extremes of the ACLU. It also has timely articles on law, science, sports, arts and entertainment. The women in Playboy are more sensual than in Maxim or FHM. Who often just have the revolving flavor of the month girl. Mr. Hefners creation has outclassed and outlasted its competition for a reason. I deduct 1 star because, blonds {usually out of a bottle} are overepresented than their actual % of our population. Mr. Hefner, please bring on more Oriental and Mediteranean goddesses. Like Kelly Hu and Vanessa Marcil. 
Playboy has always been classic to me. I know it sounds clique to say but they do have GREAT articles and the spreads of the women are tasteful. I will continue to enjoy playboy for years to come 
...if it were for heterosexuals. Playboy is a multidimensional and lively magazine for men. It addresses all areas of male life including technology, work, hobbies, and sports. Yes, sex is included, both in word and pictorial, but, clearly, Playboy is not smut. There's nothing dirty about it. Nude women appear on a small number of its pages contents, and they are far most innocently portrayed than you'll find just about anywhere else on the internet. Nowadays, the culture bar has been set so low that the idea of nude women, appearing alone in a frame, being regarded as pornography seems rather quaint. Honestly, there is no exploitation to be found in any of their exposes. The girls are an immediate justification of evolutionary psychology as they are mature but at the height of physical fertility. They are hypnotic to view. The articles, which are admittedly the clichd excuse for reading Playboy, are, in fact, extremely underrated. Many of them are focused and educational. The only reason that I don't give it five stars is due to the fact that I am not a member of the Democratic party, and I feel that Playboy has an ideological agenda that it expresses far too often. This past issue had a slanted interview with a Democratic advisor and an article by Arthur Schlesinger which was highly biased. I really think this is inappropriate because a lifestyle magazine should not shove politics down one's throat. Furthermore, such an ideological vantage point is absurd given that the editors' real enemies are not "theocrats," but are the male-hating bully boys of political correctness. None of these shrill social critics can be found are on the right. They spread misandry from perches in the media and from womyn's studies programs that terrorize our universities. A publication like this, to have any engagement or importance, must recognize, battle, and ridicule political correctness wherever it is found. 
This magazine is absolutely wonderful. After receiving my first copy, i went to their website and backordered about 10 copies...excellent reading and information regarding ideas on what people are doing to successfully make money off of your land...alpacas,flower growing,chickens, small and larger animal livestock, etc! lots of neat advertisements too, on things you just didnt know existed.....i will never be without this magazine, it is inspirational 
My husband and I have bought the past 2 issues of Hobby Farms, and we really enjoy it! It always has articles about organic methods for gardening, interesting information about animals you might not have considered (this month, Dairy Sheep!), equipment for use on the small farm, and a variety of other useful bits of information. Similar to magazines like OG &amp; Mother Earth News, but more focused on specific information for "back to the farm" individuals and lots more info on animals instead of just gardening. It has fewer ads than most magazines, but the ads are still there... but at least they're grouped next to articles that have a similar topic 
I find the Woman's Day magazine a helpful source of information for myself, my family and my friends. As I go through the articles and information in the magazine, I note items of interest for my husband and I (we are retired seniors), and for my daughter who has two children. Since the news that my son and his wife are expecting, I also save information for them. I have tried some of the recipes and were very pleased. Thank you for putting out such a great magazine 
I got the shipment just as ordered. No problems 
Woman's Day has the feel of a community with its intensely personal warmth. From parenting advice, health, cooking, crafts and homemaking and more, it bonds its target audience together whether you're a single mom, happily married, or even single. I enjoyed this magazine as a teen with my mom and love it even more as an adult. Highly recommend 
Subscriptions started promptly and I loved every issues. I cant say enough about Amazon.com. Everything they do is 1st class. You have a customer for life. Thanks! 
A real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes, It is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life. They also always have cleaning tips, health topics, diet and exercise solutions, true stories, beauty hints, inspirational articles, soul nourishing tips, recipes, recipes and more recipes, family/children, flowers, end of the magazine article to make you think about life, and gardening hints. If you want to find a cover story fast, they have an "on our cover" section in the index. In Every Issue there is a shopper's guide and a recipe index. The articles are helpful and in the March 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed. They also had an article on PCOS which is apparently more common than we women think. The beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends. Always seems rather chic. Some of the recipes in the March 2002 issue included: A luscious Lemon Coconut Pound Cake Coconut Macaroons Peanut Butter Oat Bars Baby Cheesecakes - really cute Banana Salsa French Oven Beef Stew Pasta with Shrimp The recipes are not difficult and seem practical. Even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun. A Very "American Gal" type magazine. Nothing fancy, just real life. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
This magazine is devoted to American inventions and technology that have affected our lives. In essence, this magazine is a historical magazine about American technology. Within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention. The articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology. Typically, each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society. The scope of the magazine is broad. There have been articles on the Trans-Canada highway. Another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines. In yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines. The contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned, an interesting piece of trivia of which I was previously unaware. The scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences. Biology and the development of medical technology are also covered. While the magazine is written at a level that an educated non-expert can understand, some of the biology related articles challenge my attention. This magazine is an excellent source of technological history. However, while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology, this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field. As an example, I had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works. Therefore, while I highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology, realize that for some readers, for example elementary school students, this magazine could present a reading challenge. Most articles also provide pictures or other artwork. Frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history. The quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well-preserved, but in many cases they are the only pictures available. This magazine frequently mentions the Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, which is sponsored by the United States Patent Trademark Office. A number of articles have covered inductees to the Inventor's Hall of Fame, showing that while the articles are historical in nature, they are also currently relevant. There are a large number of magazines that are either about technology, or have had articles about technology. There are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology. Sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention. However, the "American Heritage of Invention Technology" is the only magazine of which I am aware the covers the history of invention and technology. While the focus of the articles is American technology, it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of American technology. I consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology, and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines. 
I wish this magazine came out more often (as another reviewer said). It would be fascinating for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of technology and engineering. Recent articles have covered vacuum tubes, their history, and why some are still used now, and nuclear power and how that industry stalled in America. I remember reading another article in the mid-'90s about a guy in New York City who shoveled coal for a public school furnace. He explained his job and how hard it was to buy a coal shovel (the hardware store people couldn't believe it). A few years later they followed up with a note that all public schools in NYC had been converted from coal, and that the coal-shoveler's job was MUCH easier maintaining the new furnace. Stories on iron bridges and how Necco wafers are made (with the same machine for 100 years or so) and how buttons are made from seashells and how paper clips are made and how a Hollywood actress designed a frequency-jumping weapons guidance system and all sorts of others are included. Lots of cool articles about how everyday (and not-so-common) technologies went from ideas in someone's mind to products that are ready for use 
This publication is, in my opinion, the most intelligent, funny, and readable magazine about PC games available. It blows the competition offered up by the U.S. magazines out of the water. You get: *A dual-sided DVD loaded with demos, movies, screenshots, podcasts, games, mods, patches, and compiled archives of games and hardware recommendations to view from your PC *Humor which obliterates the drivel attempted by the US version. *Lots of material- it's thick and the pages are much bigger in size. You feel like you're getting a real magazine rather then a flimsy, cheap catalogue of advertisements. *Quality- both in the writing and physically. There are loads of articles with good insight into the industry every month. They are given lots of space and feel very scholarly to read. The pages are of good quality paper and the ink is crisp and clear, and is easy to read. Pick up a copy of this from a shop like Barnes and Nobles sometime to see what it's like. I guarantee you'll be impressed, especially if you're used to the gaming fare we get served this side of the pond 
I am a new teacher, and this magazine has all kinds of fun craft projects and ideas to use in your classroom, as well as up to date articles about what is going on in education right now. I woulld definitely recommend this magazine to anyone not only who is a teacher, but who has children. Most of the crafts and articles pertain to families as well as teachers 
I have been reading this magazine and love it. Perfect for those of us who decorate in the shabby,cottage, romantic or new cottage style. There has recently been a change in editors or something like that and i see quite a difference in the magazine lately. Not too happy about it. It used to have great decorating ideas for the average person. Now their showing us castles etc. And pages of retailers with yarn shops,not to mention all the gardens. Pages wasted as far as i am concerned. A little was fine but pages and pages. I don't know if i will continue to buy, probably give it another month or 2 to see. Worth checking out to see if it is for you. 
I have picked up Romantic Homes Magazine at the stands whenever it is available. I find it to be the very best magazine for those interested in decorating in the Romantic Style. The pictures are absolutely the best I have ever seen. I love the themes of the homes and the ideas are just overwhelming. I find that you can pull together the look that they show you easily and without spending $1000s of dollars. The fact that there are very few advertisements is a big plus for me - I do not like to read ads in a magazine and if there are too many I disregard the magazine. Romantic Homes has developed the very best for those that love the style - and there are many of us. Now they just need to get the magazine on more news stands (you know in the grocery stores - in Walmart etc the places that people see and buy magazines). If you love the color pink, white, cream, celedon - If you prefer roses and peonies - if a cozy quilt and a fluffy pillow call you to a day of relaxation - if a English country garden intrigues you to planting perrenials in the yard - If you like furniture that looks well loved - if Valentines day makes your heart flutter - Then this magazine is for you 
I still haven't quite gotten over the demise of Victoria magazine but Romantic Homes has helped. The photography is not as beautiful but the ideas shown offer possibilities an average person (i.e. not wealthy) might incorporate into one's home. At first the designs seemed primarily shabby chic and while there is still a lot of white rooms portrayed more color and variety has improved the spreads. I would like to see more garden articles 
First, I've bought the magazine just about every months (for 6 months) but I liked it so much that I've decided to subscribe for it. If you are into the shabby, cottage, romantic home decoration then you gonna love it! I must tell you that the pictures are sooo inspirational, that when I put the magazine down I can't resist the urge to decorate and come up with great ideas! However these fabulous homes/shops futured in the magazine look very expensive, cost lots of bucks to put together! If you have planty of $$, then it's not a problem but the average person doesn't. So that's the time to get creative! I'd say get the decorator books out too, that will help! Personally I dont' pay too much attention for the articles since about 80% of the time the Shop/Home owners only talking about how much they like to live/work in their great romantic cottage environment, which designer helpd them to get the look or which part of Europe they flew to purchase that chandalier and so on...but not a word of advice about decorating! The other 20% of the time you get designers, or other people talking about THE look, etc. that is useful. There's also a great list of websides at the back of the magazine where you can shop on line or at one of the first pages quite often a few beutiful object futured (sometimes it's even affordable)! There are not too many adds here, like in other magazines that sometimes you can't find the end of the article..so that's a big + too! 
Poetry Magazine from Chicago has been a fixture in the realm of American literature. It's the THE best and the least trendy, slick, topical publication on the market. There are works in all forms in all concerns and modes of expression plus terrific reviews as well as thought provoking essays. For the best deal on subscriptions, try to hold back until holiday time when they offer reduced prices through their website. If you love good literature treat yourself to these higher standards 
Poetry magazine out of Chicago has been around since stew was invented. (When mankind first crawled up out of the swamp and discovered fire, what they had for dinner that night was stew). Well, ok, they're 75 years old and counting. You don't hang around that long unless you're the best. I first discovered them in a college library - many, many years worth of copies - it was a treasure trove of the 1st magnitude. There's invariably one or more poems (if not the majority)in each issue that'll make you glad you subscribed. No, they're not big on pictures (none but the cover - and I remember one year when it was a drawing that didn't change for the whole year...urg) - but it IS the best Poetry Magazine you will ever find 
POETRY is fantastic, and I've always loved it, and I'd never say a word against it. No, no. But if somebody left me a hundred million dollars, I'd get just a wee bit jazzier. I mean, for god's sakes. I understand staying true to your origins, but you can at least get some pictures or something. For a hundred million, you could print issues on babylonian scrolls. You could have every page play music to accompany the poems. Where are the holograms? Where's the perfumed fold-out centerpieces? Where's the frontispiece of fine Indian silk? For crying out loud, who made these poets so damned austere? I thought you people were hedonists and sybarites. I expected you people to blow half this hundred mil right away, re-enacting the Iliad or something. But noooo.... You have to be sensible, just like everybody else in the world today. Forget you, Poetry. Take care of your 401Ks and your KEOUGHs and your TIAA-CREFs. You're just like the rest of them, you sell-outs. You mutual-fund buying push-overs. I'm heartbroken. I thought you poets were the last vestige of impracticality in America; but you've shown yourselves to be real solid folk. Wouldn't your fathers be proud. Isn't Berryman smiling in his grave? Or Walt Whitman. Or John Ashberry. (Is he dead yet?) Forget it, Poetry. You've let me down. I expected opulence; I expected a party that only poets could throw. I expected a celebration of life worth at least 30-40 mil. I give up. Nevermind. I still enjoyed the issue, however. Fine work. Keep it up 
I've been buying this magazine since it first came out. I let my subscription lapse for a few months and sure missed getting People in the mail on Fridays. It's back and I'm glad! 
People is the most incredible magazine. The writers of the magazine know exactly what you want to read as a subscriber, but there will always be an extra section that just does not interest you because no magazine can attract every ones personal interests. No matter what this magazine always makes Friday a great day. I feel the best part about People magazine is the fact that they give you special issues, like 50 Most Beautiful People, Sexiest Man Alive, and Eligible Bachelor. You get a variety highlights in each People issue. You will find inside each issue many sections pertaining to your interest. A section called the mailbox where you get to read other people responses to the articles in the last issue released. The passage page where they will give you all the details of celebrities such as marriages, births, divorces, deaths, injured, or convicted. Finally, I love getting toward the end of the magazine just to be able to read the true crime stories because they are intriguing and quite interesting. The only bad part about People magazine is that most people, just like myself, buy the issues to read about celebrities. But you also get the human interest stories which don't seem to interest everyone. Now I do not have a subscription, but I read every issue, whether I buy them myself or read the magazine at work. I would say that if you wanted to purchase a magazine this would be a great one to choose because the magazine reaches out to any one in their teenage years and up 
I enjoy reading my People magazine every weekend. After a hard week of "real life", it's nice to read about celebrities and their fancy lives and clothing, and also about some of the normal people that have done something extraordinary. People is feel-good reading, but it's a nice break from some of the violent news and depressing economic stories we hear every day. 
This is my favorite magazine. I subscribe to a lot of them but always end up reading this one the most. Keep up the good work 
Everything has gone smoothly from the moment I ordered Entertainment Weekly from this seller. It's a pleasure to do business with them and I plan on using them again in the future for my next magazine purchase. 
The smartest, best-informed, and most, well, entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture. I read it cover to cove 
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY really understands the whole arena of entertainment from film to television to DVD to music to games to even hand-held media for your phone like downloads, mobile ringtones and even book reviews. Plus you can search the archives of Entertainment Weekly for almost any article ranging in categories from Pop Culture to Photo Galleries, to their annual lists which include such top ten lists as the hottest American Idol performances ever, most memorable gay couples even before Brokeback Mountain to the most embarrassing sex scenes in the movies. The magazine has been publishing since 1990 so it has chronicled the rise of the star director, star writer, star-producer and the hyphenates -- actor/producers, actor/directors, actor/writers etc. And it's seen the rise of HOLLYWOOD USA and HOLLYWOOD WORLD where popular culture seems to impact every aspect of our lives from how we live to the clothes we wear to the food we eat to the cars we drive. Don't miss their LISTS -- who's who in various categories like the "IT LIST" to the "POWER LIST" to the "ENTERTAINERS OF THE YEAR". 
I love this magazine and I look forward to getting it in the mail every single week, unless if the last one was a double issue. Then I have to wait another whole week, which can sometimes be painful. I love the reviews and the magazine is funny, fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies, TV, music, and DVDs. The onlt complaint I have is lately they don't have as many reviews for urban releases 
Being a registered Libertarian, this magazine falls along my line of thinking. The articles are varied, easy to read, informative, and accurate. The printing is professional and on good stock. If you are middle-of-the-road politically, give this one a try 
this is just a good magizine it's sprinkled with humor and good inquizative thinking if i could give it six stars i woul 
Like my fellow choc-o-holic white brother, Floyd's Garage, I too get weird and sometimes disgusted looks from some lame pastyfaced, flatbacked white girl at the counter. What I do when I put my "Black Men" or "King" magazine down on the counter is make comments like... "I love black women," "Black Women are the best," or I might mention to those most obviously in the negative... "You wish you had some butt and hips like these girls, now ring me the f--k up! Only thing I do not like about this rag is why use such an exclusionary name? Should oldfart and lame "Playboy" or those mags out there which are in celebration of anorexia like "Stuff" or "FHM" call themselves "White Men" ?! No! Of course not! So let's all just chill and enjoy these black beauties. 
As a white middle-aged male, I always get strange looks from the counter girl when I buy my issue of Black Men. I don't know why though, where else can I do my research? Every white man's dream is a six-foot, big bootied, large breasted, black woman with straight silky hair. It is my dream to marry one. So when I'm cruising the turfs in my pimped out ride, or hip-hoppin' at the club, I gotta have the knowledge I need to hang with whatever ebony queen I have the priviledge of bumping into. You can't fake your front. It's a lot more than just bling, 40's, and expensive hubcaps. A hard core wigga's got to be down with the scene. Latest trends like music, fashion, and political viewpoints are all covered extensively and it makes it so much easier for me. Could you imaging me walking into Tobie's Lounge with a jogging suit listening to Vanilla Ice? No, I got to fill my dome with the cutting edge jive needed to be a true playa. Watch out you African Princesses. White dudes want you and we read this mag to better our chances. We may not wear Raiders caps with the tags still on them, but we are listening to 50 cent. Once you go white, you'll be feeling alright. Peace 
Meagan Good and Jessica Rabbit made some great covers happen for this mag. Melyssa "Jessica Rabbit" Ford owns this magazine with her stunning [sex appeal]. She is the bomb 
This is the best most complete music magazine out there. The interviews, sections, photographs reviews are all great. The award winning review section is incredibly wide and complete. It's clear these people care about music 
...it is also one of the things that makes me think of home when I am not there. Q has a definitve style in the music market, while most music mags focus on a musical genre or a particular target audience, Q lets any music or artist with an ounce of talent or credibility be their prize. To this end they have featured musical interviews with everyone from Madonna to Leonard Cohen, Blur to George Michael. The breadth is incredible, the journalistic style is artistic and grittily honest. The interest and need to share on the subject of sound talent is endless. The only musical snobbery you will bare witness to here is an avid aversion to the growing "pop stars/pop idol/American idol/x factor", style dross which floods todays market. Thank goodness they do so instead of pandering to it without question like the mass of vile celeb trash mags do! I use the term "celeb" in it's loose sense here since one only has to show ones naked behind on Big Brother to be labelled with this dubiuos accalade these days! The best testament to Q, for myself and many Brits, was that the late great John Peel (Uber DJ and font of all musical knowledge that was worth knowing) loved the magazine. It kind of is a printed "Old Grey Whistle Test" I suppose, Peel's much loved BBC live music show from the 60's, 70's and 80's. If you love music then you will love Q 
...even though I have to agree with the previous reviewer that they do have some favorites (inc. Beatles,Radiohead,Oasis etc) and you find them on almost every issue. But if you sort reviews carefully you'll be alright.. 
If you're a fan of science, this is a great magazine that covers a wide range of topics. Most of the time the topics are over my head, but the magazine gives you enough information to get the gist of it and prompt you to learn more about it. The subscription definitely took about 6-8 weeks to kick in, but they did send me 2 consecutive issues to make up for the delay. I would definitely recommend this magazine 
An excellent source of interesting science and technology articles. The magazine covers a variety of topics, and presents information so the reader's knowledge base is enhanced and challenged. Illistrations, within the perodical, further enhance the reader's grasp of the topic material, all excellently done. A must read for those who desire a deeper understanding of our technical, scientific world, and cosmos. 
I guess I still subscribe for the pictures. ;-) Yes, there was a time when Scientific American was so difficult to read and understand that I always felt like an idiot, even when I was an award-winning physics major in college (yeah, hard to believe!). Now it's a great way to keep up with cutting-edge scientific thought. I still don't entirely grasp the latest String Theories or Loop Quantum Gravity, but I can read those articles and--admittedly with the help of graphics--get an idea of the implications of the theories, and how they work with or conflict with other theories. Most of the hard-core articles are still written by research scientists, but these authors have become better writers, and they have learned that the audience is like me: The general population, wanting to keep up on the latest cool stuff. There are still purely scientific periodicals where they can publish their equations and use the latest jargon. I'm thankful they "dumb it down" for the rest of us. In a time when good science is often dismissed by the general public in favor of "What the BLEEP..." and other popularized pseudo-science, I am incredibly thankful that Scientific American is still true to the scientific method. 
I purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew, who just loves it. It is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it. Now only if he would put it down so others can look at it 
After getting a sample copy (no, not because of my illustrious career as Amazon reviewer--as if), I have plans to subscribe for a year or three. The articles are relevant, meaningful and well-written, and what more can one ask for? I sometimes wonder if being subscribed to two science magazines is overkill, but nah... what with all the new discoveries shaping our world, it is a good idea to keep abreast of every little thing happening in Vulcan's Lab. Scientific American is more, well, scientific than Discovery which tends more towards popular subjects such as Darwinism, under attack by a minority in the U.S. political sphere, but largely unquestioned in the scientific community. While I support Discovery's positions, they are preaching to the choir as far as I am concerned, and I do not need persuading as to the relevancy, veracity and applicability of Darwin's theories and the theories of scientists who have built even larger and more fascinating structures based upon Darwin. So if you're looking for Science Lite, go with Discover, but if you're a serious amateur scientist who already knows all the basics, go with Scientific American, or if you're like me and just can't get enough, go with BOTH, because both are REALLY good 
Many readers complain that 'Scientific American' has fallen from its former glory, and that the articles are not written with the depth and expertise they once were. I cannot really comment on this as I was never a close reader of it. What I can say is that as a general reader 'Scientific American' through the years has informed me about many of the latest developments in various areas of science. It has also provided a vocabulary in understanding certain scientific concepts. I have learned often from 'Scientific American' what major experts say about subjects which are of great interest to me such as development of artificial intelligence, human evolution, the search for extraterrestial life, cosmology, and much else. I always find the articles very clearly written and understandable. I learn from it and enjoy it, and on this basis highly recommend it to others 
I'll have to agree with the other reviewer that Men's Jounal may not be quite as good as it used to be. But it is still the best men's magazine around IMO. Flip through the other men's magazine fodder at the grocery store or your buddy's place, and save your money for a subscription to Men's Journal 
Men's Journal has gotta be one of the best deals in the whole wide world of magazines. For 10 bucks you get wonderful photography, health tips, product reviews of cool stuff you'll covet, smart writing and, of course, regular features by that greatest of American ink-spillers, Jim Harrison. Heck, if they just photo copied the Harrison pieces and sent them to me in a plain white envelope, ten bucks would still be a screaming deal. However, I still dig the fashion spreads, the book notes and the travel writing. There is a consistant sense of adventure, curiosity and life well lived in this magazine, which is why it should earn a spot on your coffee table. Did I mention it's only ten bucks 
Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine is the only financial magazine that we subscribe to, as it meets our needs perfectly. We recently purchased this magazine to give as gifts to our two sons, who are just now beginning to consider the best way to save for their retirement. We know that by reading Kiplinger's they will learn a lot about the stock market, retirement plans, mutual funds, and much much more. We highly recommend Kipplinger's Personal Finance Magazine to everyone 
Kiplinger's Personal Finance is a worthy challenge to Money Magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends, helpful financial tips, and - in KPF's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor. I came to KPF by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of Kiplinger Letters (for which, see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago. She probably thought that without I'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness, where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion. I eventually migrated up the Kiplinger food chain to the glossier KPF and have never left. Much of the information provided by KPF (mutual fund and ETF results and the liek) are widely available. The same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees, diversify, don't bail under pressure). Where KPF excels is in the short articles and tips, which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. Two fine recent examples: the articles in the September 2006 issue entitled 'Buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'. Both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions I'm likely to make in the new year. What's more, the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate. In terms of marco-economic instincts, the Kiplinger Washington Editors run bullish, though not quite so much as Money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. KPF won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either, a fact that is well observed by their authors, who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or German auto makers. Don't get me wrong, I read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about KPF if it were my only source. But KPF's monthly arrival is still always welcomed, as it has been for years. It remains firmly entrenched in my top tier 
Received the first issue 3 weeks after placing the subscribtion order with amazon, so that was faster than promised. Kiplinger's has a wealth of information and I look forward to receiving it every month. As I am exclusively holding mutual funds and no individual stocks, some of the information in the magazine is of no interest to me. For that reason I prefer Money magazine. But reading both magazines on a monthly basis for $1 per issue keeps me more disciplined and focused on saving money and that's worth every penny of it. 
I have read several financial magazine: Money, Forbes, Business Week, Fortune, Smart Money, and Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine. I must say that of all these magazines, Kiplinger and Smart Money are the two most useful magazines in terms of personal finance. Of this two, Kiplinger is the better one. I find that most finance magazine provide very narrow opinions on investment and finance planning. The writers of Kiplinger, however, provide very diversified opinions on investment and finance planning. This may not sound like a good idea for novice, but it is certainly a welcome feature and the most feature, in my opinion, for a sophisticate reader 
Outstanding comparitive review of new vehicles for 2006. Combined with Consumers report evaluations, no reason to go into dealership with many questions. December 2005 issue a "must have for serious lookers" contemplating purchase 
My retirement plan sends me a magazine, which is so boring that I don't even bother to open it anymore; Kiplinger's isn't at all like that. The best part of Kiplinger's is that it describes how real people with average salaries, kids, and debts can invest for the future. There are also some great articles for parents about how to teach their kids to manage their money. Everything seems practical, but I've yet to try any of it. The magazine is broken into four sections: `Ahead' short articles about finance news and current event, `investing' about investing mostly stocks, `your money' about ways to invest your money though not as technical as the investing section and more diverse, and `spending' which is basically general interest about new fun technologies and other ways to spend all the money saved or made through investing 
Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine fits right in the middle between the lowest-common denominator approach of Money magazine and the head-in-the-clouds attitude at Worth magazine. Kiplinger's has a nicely balanced style and tone; it never preaches, and I almost always find a tip, suggestion, or tax-saving idea that pays for my year's subscription in every single issue. If that's the measure of the value of a personal finance magazine, then Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine deserves a five-star rating. Good stuff, and a good value 
I've read other personal finance magazines before and found them to be either too basic to be worth my time, or too focused on some obscure area. I'm not a financial professional, but I like to constantly increase my knowledge of personal finance. Kiplinger's has been great for that. I skip 80% of the articles in this magazine, but that still leaves one or two in every issue that teach me about an area I didn't know about -- where to buy bonds online the most cheaply, how to find good financial advice, why options are priced the way they are. One good article pays for the entire annual subscription. Each issue has a wide range of articles appealing to lots of levels of experience 
If you're ordering this, you should know what you're getting, because I assume you've read the magazine before. However, the only downside is, it took a full 10 weeks to receive our first copy. I recommend it, but understand that you will probably have to buy two issues off the newsstand before you receive your first subscribed copy. 
Each issue of Family Circle is full of USEFUL information. Ordering it through Amazon is so easy. A few clicks on the computer and you are done 
Family Circle is aimed at female readers with articles focusing on topics like parenting, marriage, etiquette and beauty and fashion. Each issue also features an article on Women who make a Difference. There is also a Health Report article, fitness articles, and diet tips, including menus and recipes. There are lots of recipes, in fact, including pull out recipe cards that can be filed in your recipe box. There are also articles on gardening, decorating ideas, and craft ideas. A reader's tip column pays readers $50, if their tips are used. Family Circle is a good magazine for all women. 
This is the third time I have purchased Handyman Magazine for family members as gifts. This time, I misunderstood how to gift the item. Unfortunately, I did not have a second chance to send the magazine to a family member as a Christmas Gift. After calling, the only recourse I was given was to to refuse the magazine when it comes (because it is coming to me instead of my son in Atlanta), call and cancel the order and reorder. Unfortunately, doing this, it will not reach my son in time for Christmas. I would like to see something built into the system that gives a second chance to bill me, but send as a gift 
This is one of the best sources for ideas on home improvement. Beyond the great ideas, they also give you detailed directions on projects along with a good number of pictures. I have learned how to do a great number of things I used to hire others to do because I thought I didn't have the skills - they make most projects around the house seem accessible, but not by oversimplifying the process. Some may argue that they give too much detail, but this is essential for anyone new to a project and can be breezed through for those that are more experienced. The only downside is that they give you ideas for things you never knew you needed! 
I never had my own subscription to this magazine. My mother-in-law subscribed and then would send it to me when she was done. I have saved every copy. There are so many great ideas in this magazine. They had one to make a playing card holder out of coffee cans lids. It was great for my 6 and 3 year old for playing UNO, especially when you have a lot of cards to hold. My 13 year old is selling magazines for her school and FamilyFun is one of the magazines available. I am ordering it, I miss reading it since my mother-in-law's subscription ran out. (I was hoping she would send me a subscription for Christmas since she knew how much I enjoyed it.) It's a great magazine for parents, grandparents or even aunts and uncles. There are tons of things to do and great advice as well. They have a website that has some of the information from old articles (like the birthday cakes). 
This is the best magazine for the busy kids to keep them busy. I was really impressed with the easy of the crafts and the details in the instructions. I love this magazine 
I go to a gym where people share their magazines, and came across this gem. While it focuses on value vacation packages, the benefit that I've gained from it is its list of 40 top vacation packages to destinations around the world. The magazine also offers an up-to-date web page describing even more places and bargains. It has really expanded my horizons about possible vacation spots. That alone is worth the reasonable cost 
Frommer's Budget Travel always has something I can use - every month. Their 20 quick tips are great, the features are actually trips that can be taken without breaking the bank. 2 thumbs up 
Budget Travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far-away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland. I also like some, not all, of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written. However, at the same time, it does need better organization as compared with (Horrors)Conde Nast. I am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible - I cant access it!! 
Arthur Frommer's "Budget Travel" is a terrifc magazine for those thinking about travel or vacation. In the 10 issues you get over a year(for a "budget" price no less), you'll find hundreds of ideas for places to go and suggestions on how to get there, when is the best time to go, where and what to eat, where to stay, local shopping, the list goes on. And..the great part is the writers of the articles have done all the work for you. They have combed the web for the best prices, attractions to visit, and for accomodations that suit your needs, and in most cases have actually visited the destination or taken the Road Trip to let you know how it went. There are articles of interest for those wanting a family style vacation( a recent article, listed and wrote about camps that the entire family could attend, with various price ranges), romantic getaways or business trips. Maybe you are looking for the best cruise deal, or want to tour Europe. There's something for every style of travel. Every month there is a "Trip Coach". People write in and have a good idea of where they want to go, and BT plans out an entire itinerary for them. "Road Trip" is another monthly feature that plans out an excursion through a particular area. These articles give lots of details of places to go, and things to do and see along the way. They also give you a breakdown of choices in different price ranges, of hotel accomodations, travel modes, restaurants, and attractions. In a recent article they even listed which hotels where geared toward people interested in environmental issues. So for the person looking for some great ideas for a vacation, or anyone just wanting to get away for a while, this magazine offers excellent advice. However, I thought there were too many ads for vacation spots that were "over-budget". Also, I would have liked to have seen a little more for those wanting to travel for an extended period of time. Maybe for those retiring, and want to see the country in a RV for example.(although there was an article recently on how to BUY an RV, there wasn't much in the way of travel ideas). Overall, you really get your money's worth with ideas for travel, and a periodical that will save you time and money. It's a good place to start your vacation plans, and you may not have to go any further! Enjoy....Laurie 
What I like about this magazine is that it does not focus on mainstream attractions and destinations. It tries to go off the beaten path, and provides many suggestions of places to visit, restaurants to eat at, and even specific places to shop. Not only that, on every issue they have a list of awesome travel tips provided by travelers. In addition they list great travel specials and the corresponding websites. I've been a subscriber for approximately 6 months, and I have to say that I enjoy this magazine. 
Most photo magazines handle analog and digital photography as separate entities. This magazine is the perfect bridge between the two media. Besides that, its articles are very insightful, with a more artistic and professional tone than most photo magazines, but without falling into a snobbish attitude. Furthermore, they avoid that commercial point of view that hampers a good photo magazine. The only thing I regret is the lack of technical information about the pictures they show. Anyway, each issue is a pleasure to read 
Regular readers of my reviews are probably getting sick of me mentioning Kage Baker, but I have to credit her for getting me to try a lot of things that I wouldn't normally try if she hadn't been a part of them. Asimov's Science Fiction magazine is another time where this is the case. While I have bought Fantasy Science Fiction magazine every month for a while now, I would also check Asimov's to see if it had a Baker story. If it did, I would buy it. What I have found, however, is that I have enjoyed most of the other stories in the issues I have bought as well. Thus, from now on I will be buying it every month too. Much like Fantasy Science Fiction, Asimov's contains mostly science fiction stories of various lengths (short story, novelette, novella) along with a couple of columns and some cartoons. The difference between the two is that Asimov's contains no fantasy (though some of Mike Resnick's stories have a fantasy feel to them). However, the magazine likes to concentrate on character-based science fiction, so you won't see a lot of "technology first, character second" stories in the magazine. Personally, I think that's a good thing as hard science fiction turns me off. If you're more into the hard sciences, you may find stuff in here to interest you, but there's a good chance that you won't. Occasionally, there will be guest editorials (they printed George R.R. Martin's Guest of Honor speech from Worldcon in the October/November issue). There's always an "On Books" column, sometimes written by Paul Di Filippo, sometimes by Peter Heck. The authors use this column to recommend books that you may not have come across. Robert Silverberg opens each issue with a "Reflections" column that can cover everything from space exploration to ideas on story-writing. James Patrick Kelly occasionally is featured with an "On the Net" column, examining various science fiction web sites and other online activities. Unlike Fantasy Science Fiction, there is often some poetry included as well. Finally, there is a calendar of upcoming conventions that covers the world so you can always find someplace to go if you need to get together with a group of fans. The bread and butter of the magazine, though, are the stories. Each story has an introduction from the editor (currently Gardner Dozois, though that will change to Sheila Williams with the January issue), which may explain the genesis of the story, or just tell us how long it's been since that author has appeared in Asimov's. One of the things about Asimov's that is different is that it often serializes stories that will eventually appear in book form. Allen M. Steele's Coyote series has been serialized over the last couple of years with all of them being collected in two books (Coyote from a couple of years ago, and the upcoming Coyote Rising). Also, Charles Stross' Accelerando has been featured in recent issues. The one drawback to this is for readers who only pick up the occasional issue. For instance, "Survivor" in the October/November issue didn't really mean a lot because I've missed everything that came before it. It does reward regular readers, though. Asimov's has many writers who write almost exclusively for that magazine, or at the very least the authors submit their stories to this magazine for first refusal. My favourite, Kage Baker, only seems to appear here, with only one story that I know of appearing in Realms of Fantasy. Allen M. Steele is another. Robert Reed seems to be featured everywhere (I swear that guy is churning them out like he's a machine) but he is featured a lot in Asimov's. The magazine is bound just like Fantasy Science Fiction, however the cover is thin paper rather than thicker stock, so it will tear a bit easier. This does have the advantage that you can sometimes leave it lying open for reading (though this only works if you're toward the middle of it). It also means it can be rolled up if necessary. The only other fault I have with it, and this is strictly a personal thing, is that the stories don't always grab me as much as they do in Fantasy Science Fiction. This is mainly because I'm more into fantasy than science fiction, so this certainly wouldn't be the case for everyone. While the hit and miss ratio varies from issue to issue, I can say that I have never skipped a story in the magazine. Again, that's a benefit of short fiction. You're not going to waste a lot of time on them. If I had to choose between the two magazines, I would definitely choose Fantasy Science Fiction. However, Asimov's is certainly good enough that it's easy to make room for both of them. Plus, by picking them both up, I feel like I'm doing my part in keeping short fiction alive. It's only a small part, but every little bit helps. David Ro 
Asimov's provides 11 issues annually, packed with science fiction novellas, novelettes, short stories, poems, book reviews, and editorial articles. As with any anthology or anthology-magazine, the story quality varies, but there are some true gems. Alan M. Steele wrote a series of stories for Asimov's, beginning with the wonderful "Stealing Alabama" and including the stunning "The Days Between". These stories were later combined in the novel "Coyote". One value of this magazine is to introduce readers to authors they do not know. Several years ago, George R. R. Martin wrote a short story for Asimov's that I found enthralling. It turned out to be a portion of Martin's then-upcoming novel, "A Game of Thrones", which is in itself the first in a series of books (now going on four, rumored to be seven overall) called "A Song of Ice and Fire" and that is probably my all-time favorite fantasy series. Overall, Asimov's is a science fiction buffet; you get a little taste of everything, some of it good (Kage Baker's "Company" series), some of it great (Martin's and Steele's above-mentioned stories), and some of it that you take a bite and leave the rest for the bus-boy (I don't care for Elliot Fintushels' "Izzy" series) 
I was not a very good Christian a few years ago, my faith had slipped and practically dissolved. Then I was blessed by becoming friends with a true follower of Christ with his feet firmly embedded on the Lords path and content in his place with Him. The young man (he was only 45) brought me back into the fold and back to Jesus. I know it was his wife who secretly sent me the subscription for the first time. It has made such a difference in my life and my husbands, we can read the articles together and get so much wonderful information and answers at times, we never knew we were asking! My "Mentor David passed away suddenly last year, and although I know where he is and is watching over us all, with the help of his kindness, love and faith, between him, his wife, and Today's Christian Woman, my home and family and others who I am able to touch with the joy of knowing Christ, it helps to ease the pain of loss and the knowledge that I am "on the right path".

This is the only magazine I read from cover to cover. I wish it came out every month! I pass it to my sister after I'm finished with it. It is very informative and very well-written 
I've been playing for about 2 years and can only imagine where I would be without the help of this magazine. It has a few lessons from the greats (How To's, examples and some tabs and practicing techniques). What more could a budding guitarist ask for? It has product reviews and then interviews with a bunch of guys that I don't really give a crap about hearing from and then some from the guys I wanna hear from. It's like christmas one day out of every month! YIPPEE! I have subscriptions to some of the other MAG's and I enjoy finding out what tabs they've (GW) chosen and it gives me a chance to get a peak at what these fools are doing in those sweeet songs (lyrics, stories from the artists that created these songs and the background/origin of the song, etc.). I enjoy all 3 of the subscriptions but I'm partial to this one for some reason. I recommend this one and Guitar Player if your fresh on the instrument. 
i love both guitar one and guitar world, but i like guitar one a Tiny bit more. But i love both magazine 
This is a great magazine. I recently Started reading it and a few others similar to it. It does give helpful business strategies and financial planning advice. It really is an eye opener to all the ways there are to make money and to have a business not just in one market but in a variety of Markets. 
I have been a subscriber since college days at Wharton. Would never let me subscription lapse if you paid me. The real money players read this magazine 
By far the best business magazine that I have read. Really good articles about up and coming (or down and leaving) entreprenuers, markets, and investing. If you like CNN, you might as well stick with Fortune. It doesn't simply reprint the conventional wisdom de jure like other business publications. You also get FYI (lifestyle) and ASAP (technology) supplements, and their top-notch online content is regularly updated with fresh ideas. I'm often pointed to excellent books through their articles, such as the "Emotional Intelligence Quickbook" which was part of a feature on EQ testing (includes an online EQ test with the book). Forbes always seems to think of their readers that way.. 
Great magazine for mind/body/spirit. offers lots of calming stress relievers and great yoga poses. As well a some really ads that lead to excellent websites and products. If I have to do some updating on my Yoga or Meditation gear I look here first to see whats recommended 
This is just the best Yoga Magazine out there. Articles cover all areas and are suitable for the practioner as well as the teacher. I've learned so much from the magazine, and enjoy reading the human interest articles too 
I find interesting articles in every issue I receive. I like the fact that the articles offer a wide range of topics. For example, you will find articles relating to diet, travel, relationships and physiology. All the issues provide yoga sequences that you can practice at home. The magazine will offer advanced sequences that are more physically demanding and simplier ones that are much less physically demanding. The articles portray nicely sized color photos of the pose with in-depth explanations on how to perform each pose. I am a visual person who needs to see the more complex poses performed in front of me rather than described in writing, so unfortunately, I can't take advantage of some of the more difficult sequences. However, if have been practicing yoga for some time and are familar enough with a wide range of poses, or can follow in-depth written instruction, you will enjoy these sections. You may be surprised with the volume of advertisements found in each issue. It doesn't bother me because there still remains plenty of good reading in each issue. You will receive only 7 issues in a 12 month period. It would be nice to receive one every month. Overall, an entertaining and informative magazine that I recommend. Yoga Journal also has a fantasic website that you can explore for free. The website offers many interesting articles and provides instruction and information on many common yoga poses. 
This magazine is very helpful to me in my practice of yoga. Not being able to go to classes, I bought video tapes and books, and have been practicing for about 2 years now with my children at home. Since I began receiving YJ about 6 months ago, I have felt a renewed inspiration in my practice. There is always something new to try, so I don't feel stagnant. The only thing I think could be improved upon would be to add more pictures of men and maybe even children practicing yoga 
Buy this magazine without hesitation. Has wonderful articles from a spiritual and holistic perspective. Thank you so much for creating such a creative magazine 
I have been an avid reader of Yoga Journal for a few years now. This magazine is a must for the serious practitioner of yoga - as well as for those who are curious and searching. Each month, YJ delivers. You'll find information on yoga trends, book and music reviews, philosophy, different styles of yoga, interviews with popular yoga instructors, etc. Routines are featured in every issues as well as in depth coverage on poses. You'll learn more about anatomy and the mechanics of asanas than you ever imagined! As a practitioner, this is a helpful magazine - as a yoga teacher, this is an essential reference for me. I learn so much every month, I can't imagine my practice without it! 
This magazine is the real thing. I believe yoga is significantly more than which blocks help with better alignment, and wish that this were a magazine that supported this fact. I also recommend Tao, Tantra, Sex and the perfect lover By Mabel Ia 
To transform the world, we must begin with ourselves. ~J. Krishnamurti My April 2005 copy of Yoga Journal is looking a little worse for wear. I was reading it in the tub and do take a rather extreme delight in ripping out pages of interest. I have to organize the new products to try in one pile and the pages about yoga postures in another. Then, there is the page about freeing yourself from destructive emotional patterns that I should read at least four more times and the recipe for Chocolate-Grand Marnier Dessert. Of course I'm fresh out of Grand Marnier so I have to save the recipe and put it in the "recipe to make soon" file. The Yoga Journal is not just a fun read for me. I literally try to take the teaching and the ideas and put them into practice. Literally in Yoga practice and more intellectually in taming stress and taking control of my emotions. Not that Yoga is not intellectual because it really is a very intellectually enhancing exercise. Through reading about Yoga you can learn how to calm your mind and learn how to focus on what is important in life. To say Yoga has influenced me for the better is a great understatement. The happiest place in my day is perhaps at the end of a Yoga routine when I feel completely relaxed, without any negative emotions and have a sense that in the midst of the chaos of life, there is a place of peace inside me that I can escape to anytime I choose. If you tend to buy Yoga "workouts" then you will appreciate the "yocabulary" to explore various Yoga words in more depth. There are book/video/music reviews for Yoga inspired items. The advertising seems mostly about Yoga retreats or new Yoga DVDs like Sara Ivanhoe's Natural Journeys 20 Minute Yoga Makeover routines, which I love. Now the only question is, is the Aveeno body wash in my shower a result of seeing an advertisement in this magazine and how many more Tazo teas are there to try? As the Wake Up to Your Life article states: "Why wait around for enlightenment when you can enjoy everyday awakenings." You just know someone's life was changed by reading that one line in this magazine. It definitely made me think. If you love collecting quotes or you enjoy learning more about your Yoga practice, this is an essential Yoga magazine. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
I have been a regular subscriber of sci fi mags for just about the past 15 yrs or so. It all began with Omni and when Omni folded, I found a a copy of Science Fiction Age. I had been subscribed to it for about 2 years before it folded. I found a few Omni-like glossy mag twins thereafter, but they all folded as well. Finally, I found the magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Analog and have been consistently subscribed to other for the past 10 yrs. Both of the latter are outstanding 'zines but for me, Analog is the best because it satisfies the craving for hard sci fi and *fact* at the same time. If F Analog ever have to close up shop then I would hope they would merge because then I'd have my hard sci fi, fact *and* horror/fantasy all in a one stop shop. 
I haven't actually read Analog for about 20 years, but it was my introduction to science fiction very nearly 40 years ago, when I shared a flat (sorry, must use American, an appartment) in New York with one of John W. Campbell's editorial assitants! Since then, the genre has provided education, solace, amusement - and some disdain from others - and I despair at how few really good new English SF writers there seem to be. However, anyone (and I do mean anyone) who tries Analog with an open mind will find it a revelation 
Disclaimer up front: I've had three novels serialized in ANALOG (Nebula winner THE TERMINAL EXPERIMENT; Hugo and Nebula nominee STARPLEX; and the just-completed HOMINIDS). But I'm also a long-time reader of the magazine (28 years now), and I love it. The fiction is real SF -- stories in which the science is accurate and the speculation credible. But I also love the editorials by Stanley Schmidt; the Alternate View columns by Jeff Kooistra and John Cramer (some of the best science writing available anywhere these days), the spirited letters-to-the-editors section, and Tom Easton's book reviews. This is the number-one bestselling science-fiction magazine in the world, and justly so 
I've been a subscriber for about 40 years, from when it was named Astounding, and almost never disappointed. In addition to great authors (many of whom I met first on Astounding/Analog pages), great short stories, reviews, and feedback - don't miss the thought provoking editorials. No matter who is the current editor, the editorials make you check your firmly held beliefs and preconceived notions, and *think*. You may not agree, but you'll definitely think. Well worth the money 
This is a very cool magazine!! You won't regret ordering it!! In every issue you get awsome pin-ups of your fave stars, celeb info,plus hair and make-up tips!!! What's not to love about that !!! Ignore all the one star comments!!! I'm 12 and this mag TOTALLY has what I want!!!!! Your teen daughter will too! To any of the people who gave this magazine a poor rating: Maybe the REAL "superficial" morans are people who can't respect others opions- not everyone dislikes this magazine like you do! 
great monthly information on the latest design trends and figures. Sadly it only comes 2x's a year 
I believe that this magazine is a must have for any designer. Especially those that are new to the field. I am a student and I read this magazine from cover to cover and feel that it covers all aspects of the business well. It is written so that even the beginner can understand all of the aspects and use the ideas in their everyday work/projects. I think that this magazine is one of the best references for graphic design on the market that I have found 
American Girl magazine is geared to girls aged 7-13. Much younger than that and many girls aren't reading at the appropriate level yet. Much older and they may be ready to move on. But honestly I'm surprised to read so many reviews by 10 or 11 year old girls who feel they're too old for this magazine. I don't believe girls that age NEED magazines based solely on makeup tricks, flirting with boys, etc. AG has articles such as dealing with relationships with friends. Like when you and your best friend start to grow apart. Or when she moves away. Articles like one about a girl whose family travels around the world on their sailboat for two years. Crafts that you can actually be proud to give at the age of 10. Several reviewer have complained that the magazine is short and expensive. It is. But here's why: there is NO advertising (short of anything American Girl related). In many magazines, advertising accounts for easily half the pages. And advertising enables publishers to sell magazines for a low cost. AG has no advertising and so has to charge a fair price to produce it. I'm more than willing to pay for that kind of publication. Parents ordering for your daughters, you know your girl. If you've got a 10 year old going on 16, this may not be for your child. If you have a precocious 6 year old, she might like it as well. AG is the kind of magazine I'm glad my daughters enjoy 
I have been subscribing to American Girl magazine since I was nine or so, and I am now thirteen. Here are the Pros and Cons : Pros: -Appropriate for younger children -No advertisements! -Has section on fun and unique crafts -Fun quizzes -Advice on frendships in basically ever issue Cons: -Way too expensive ($4.77 for one issue? Please) -Usually less than 60 pages -Only comes out every other month -Should have at least a little bit on fashion, though it sometimes has hair ideas Overall, this magazine is perfect for ages 8-12, but I feel like I am getting a little too old for it. You may like "Discovery Girls", which is basically the same thing as American Girl, but has some stuff on fashion and has more pages 
I've been checking this out for years. I love the paper stock, very high quality and bound well - they're almost like books. The photography is uniformly excellent and the graphical design is terrific. This is the kind of magazine that makes long trips via airline more tolerable. It's packed with information. HOWEVER, there is one subject they never broach, and it is to their detriment - I'm talkin' 'bout ANAL SEX. You never see questions or articles about it. I suspect it is avoided so as not to offend certain markets, to be able to have the widest distribution possible. It's just funny. In any event, it's still worth looking at even if it is referred to as the male "Cosmo", or the "straight man's gay porn" 
My brother dismissed magazines such as "Men's Health", due to an errant assumption that such publications were not for typical suburban Dads like him. A heart attack and quad bypass later, he changed his mind! I bought him a subscripton to enjoy during his recovery, and he has really gotten a lot out of it. It's not glossy "fluff"; it actually has stuff he reads and uses each month. This is one subscription that is worth every penny 
A monthly journal (10 issues annually) established almost 25 years ago, THE NEW CRITERION has covered the world of the cultured arts with a keenly critical eye, disposed towards high artistic standards and sound moral judgments. Delightfully un-PC, its critical stance remains unmitigatedly harsh towards the often flaccid and self-satisfied artistic endeavors of "post-modernity" and the sanctimonious aires of radicalized professors blighting the universities. Yet, for all of the (largely justified) editorial spleen, THE NEW CRITERION's virtues are located in the variety of outstanding contributors. In the literary field alone, luminaries such Joseph Epstein, John Simon, Guy Davenport and Christopher Ricks have graced the pages of THE NEW CRITERION ( whose title alludes to, and takes up the mantle of, T.S. Eliot's "CRITERION", 1920-39 ). There is an admirable aesthetic evident in THE NEW CRITERION's visual layout, unchanged for many years, the cover featuring the journal title with the date and table of contents of the particular issue located directly below. Mercifully, the font used for essays is both pleasing to, and easy on, the eyes. Based in a bustlingly artistic city (Manhattan), THE NEW CRITERION takes advantage of its location to survey the world of theater, art and music. Particular critics are deployed in the aforementioned "departments", a move that allows one to glean consistency in point of view (agree or disagree as one may). Mark Steyn is often devastatingly funny in his theater reviews (one can easily imagine impresario's cringing at the prospect of his notices) and classical music critic Jay Nordlinger ("New York Chronicle") is admirably forthright in rendering opinions devoid of equivocation. Poetry, from famous and unknown writers, is regularly featured in THE NEW CRITERION (new executive editor, David Yezzi, is a well respected poet and critic). Symposiums on various cultural/political issues, with contributions from learned panelists, are arranged once or twice a year. Book reviews, undertaken by various (commissioned) writers, are reliably informative, often a spur to read more than just the subject under review. Despite its "conservative" label, most of THE NEW CRITERION's contributors display little of their political beliefs. In fact, many contributors could quite easily be referred to as "liberal", in one or another of the aspects that protean word admits ( such permutations are just as easily applicable to "conservative", lately quite a supple term, readily conducive to metamorphosis according to agenda ). However, the editorial perspectives of Hilton Kramer and Roger Kimball do, lamentably, fit within a general pattern of thought one could label "neo-conservatism", especially as regards their support of the Bush administration and its "war on terror". It pains me to mention this Achilles Heel, especially out of the respect due to Mr. Kimball, whose wide-ranging essays have displayed moral as well as literary acumen. How can an admirer of George Santayana and T.S. Eliot be so blind to the hubristic foolishness ( nay, immorality ) of this foreign policy disaster? When Mr. Kimball (no fan of the Jacobin or Bolshevik revolutions) defends the Bush administration, he endorses ideological premises clearly related to those diabolic social experiments: military adventurism in the name of global democratic revolution ( freeing the world from tyranny; igniting "fire in the minds of men" ). Evidently, Mr. Kimball associates opposition to this war with the counter-cultural movement of the 1960's. While anyone of sense would deplore the excesses of that epoch, it is clear that the problems which have ignited the current conflagration have roots in something more substantial than Ginsberg, Haight-Ashbury and "soixante-huitards". To be fair, THE NEW CRITERION, more than any truly neo-conservative publication, does invite writers (Roger Scruton, RJ Stove, et al) with differing perspectives; this redeems the journal from the monomaniacal, stultifying tendencies exhibited in COMMENTARY or THE WEEKLY STANDARD. Nevertheless, mistakes and all, THE NEW CRITERION, in terms of sheer quality and comprehensiveness, remains a vital and impassioned advocate of high culture. In doing so, it does honor to the memory of the journal ( and *its* editor ) that inspired it. High criteria indeed. 
If you enjoy politics, TV, museums, art all the gifts of the enlightenment, the open society, and the liberty we all enjoy --- spare no expense get this product. 10 issues per year (off jul/aug). The -oh so sophisticated- people who run the universities/networks/opinion mags do not get it right all the time. Want to know why how ? I really can't wait for the first week of the month when a new issue shows up. I love this gem have for 3 years + now 
Road Track is arguably the best automotive magazine out there. It has the best photography, and covers a wide range of intriguing cars. It provides excellent coverage of the latest from Ferarri and Porche, along with great articles on classic race cars. Where R slacks, however, is on its coverage of every day cars. Your not going to find too much about the Ford Focus in this magazine. If you are looking for a magazine to learn about the standard cars on the auto market, go for Motor Trend, but if you are looking for a magazine that covers exotic cars the car-lovers way, this is the magazine for yo 
I'm a subscriber to Road Track, Car and Driver, and Motor Trend. Simply put, R is the one I look forward to the most each month. If you're looking for a well-rounded auto magazine, this is it. In R you'll find: -Road Tests and First Drives. -An excellent "Ampersand" monthly feature with all the latest info on future cars and prototypes. -News about the latest races and drivers. -Top-notch photography and art. -Witty columnists. (see Side Glances by Peter Egan) -The occasional technology-related feature. -Classic cars, classic drivers, classic tracks. The best historical content in the business. -Very little content on SUVs. (a positive in my book) The competitors: Car and Driver has substantially more road tests and previews, and some good specialty features on a pretty regular basis, but hardly anything on racing and history. Frankly, Motor Trend isn't anything to write home about. The articles are shorter and less captivating, they can't seem to settle on a design theme, and they also have a lack of racing and historical content. If I had to pick just one, Road Track would definitely be my choice. 
Like everyone else, I have read them all over the last 15-20 years. But Road Track is the one that I have consistently subscribed to over that time. RT offers the least biased, most informative articles and comparisons out there. Car and Driver on the other hand, seems heavily biased towards Honda and BMW (I call it the Lemming Factor) and their comparisons are overly subjective. RT's format, photography and writing are 2nd to none and the monthly columns and auto news bits are entertaining 
Road and Track is different than most car enthusiast magazines. Not only does it spend time on the cars of today, it also has articles on vintage models and racecars. I have found that Road and Track goes much more in depth than others, rewarding the reader. However, if you do not like performance cars look for something els 
Yvette Linton-Smith and many other women can attest to the absolute love and passion as shown in his work of the desire and wanting of the female form. Mr. Da Silveira has no reason or motive to be with a woman other than the fact that he cares for the passion and friendship. Mr. Da Silveira sexual preferences as all people in no way should be the concern of the paparazzi/press.. 
I am not the only to think Jose Da Silveira is not straight. Now that his carrer is back on track, the affirmation of his gayness would be terribly damaging. I believe this is the reason this Yvette Linton-Smith has been hired to go along for a while to make sure ppeople, mainly women can look at him with envy and desire and continue supporting him. Imagine what would happen to his carrer if he turned out to be gay....just your little detective. Susi

Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area. Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine. Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers. Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families. The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the "Currents" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price. Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel. Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans. Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more "unknown" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property. 
You don't have to live on the coast to enjoy this magazine, you only have to love it. "Coastal Living" is informative and enjoyable reading that covers everything from decorating a beach home to getting involved with environmental causes. From Alaska to Rhode Island,from Hawaii to Florida, and everyplace in between that has a coastline, you'll find well written articles on the best vacation spots,places of historical interest,great seafood recipes,architecture,saving the coastlines,travel and decorating tips. If you are a lover of beaches or boating,a sunworshiper or have a strong interest in the coastline, the price is right for a subscription. For those just looking for some ideas on travel or a few decorating tips, you may just want to pick one up from the newstand and check it out first.It is a good size periodical,with many articles and beautiful pictures, that will make you just want to pack up and head for the coast...any coast! Nice change of pace for the coffee table too....enjoy...Laurie 
I was never so bothered by ads. Other are, I guess. I found this magazine to be very good. My kids both loved and read and reread it. It has shorter articles in some parts which is great for those with limited attention. It also has interesting facts which is also great for boys who tend to like reading nonfiction. If you are the parent of a boy who doesn't like reading, see if your local library has this magazine and try it out on them. They just might like it. I teach ESL to newcomers in highschool, and I think I can bring my worn back issues to class for them to read. Frankly, I think the magazine is fine, and I would consider a subscription for my class 
WHY is almost everybody giving NG Kids a bad review? I LOVE NG Kids almost as much as i love Discovery Girls and i don't think it has THAT many ads. I have a 1 year subscription to NG Kids and a 2 year subscription to Discovery Girls. NG comes out once a month, DG twice a month. So i'll have twelve issues of NG in 1 year and 12 issues of DG in two years. Actually 13 because i ordered the Special Edition. 
This is such a good mag! i loved all the crafts, animal pics, and other cool stuff. I learned how to feng shui your room and find out what a liger looks like. The jokes are funny too. this is one: What do you get when you cross a pig with a centipede? Bacon and legs!. They also tell you cool facts like: Mona Lisa has no eye brows and most in england belong to the queen. So as you see this ROCKS! Buy it, buy it now. -JAMI 
This magazine does hold my kids' interest, and I feel it was worth the money for one year. The articles and photos are meaningful and have helped get my kids interested in a variety of world subjects. However, I probably won't renew because I feel the regular National Geographic Magazine is also suitable for kids and better in the long run. I guess it would be good for parents to screen and limit use of the regular magazine with regards to the very young, but for the most part kids are exposed to relevant current issues at school and in the media anyway, so the issues and photos of National Geographic Magazine are not too adult or inappropriate. 
My students love getting a chance to read on current topics they are interested in 
I bought this for my nephew last year for Christmas - and he reads it cover to cover every month!! I have renewed for him and he is delighted to have this magazine. 
SI for Kids is even better than the one for adults 
My son is a sports junkie at 7 years old. He gets really excited everytime the issue shows up in the mail. It is an easy read for him and he loves the posters and pictures included in each issue. If you have a budding sports enthusist I would definetly recommend this magazine. Besides the more reading your child does, the better it is for them, no matter the reading medium. 
We bought a subscription to Sports Illustrated for Kids last year for our Grandson's birthday. He is interested in all sports, but especially football. He enjoys the magazine so much we renewed the subscription for his birthday this year. Happy 11th Birthday, Matt. With love, Grandma and Grandp 
My son looks forward to his Ranger Rick magazine. I am glad that we decided to go with Ranger Rick instead of the 4-6 year old magazine version. Our 4 year old loves the pictures and he loves the information. 
Our Ranger Rick issues are used first as reading material, then discussion material, then project material (cut-outs, etc) then recycling to neighbors who enjoy them just as much. Tear out posters line my son's walls. There is no objectionable material in the magazine, just wholesome, fun reading. No political agenda is discernable from it, which is refreshing. As soon as it comes in the mail, my 10 year old insists on sitting right down and reading the whole thing through. The knowledge the magazine imparts carries over into the school day, where his teacher is amazed at his recall and knowledge. 
I grew up on Ranger Rick, and was overjoyed to find the mag again. Its just as good as ever and perfect for nature loving kids. Its highly educational and fun. I still remember 20 years ago running to the mailbox waiting for Ranger Rick. Great magazine, truely. Your kids are likely to learn more from RR than at school. 
We ordered Ranger Rick for our kidergartener grandson. He loves receiving the magazine in the mail. The gorgeous photos pique his interest and encourage him to "read" through every page. We spend time reading the articles aloud to him, thus enjoying some "quality" time with each other. He remembers much of the information, which enhances his learning skills. All-in all, the Ranger Rick subscription is a plus. We figure, as time goes by, our grandson will enjoy the magazine for years to come, especially when he's able to read the articles himself 
My 4 year old son will not go to sleep with out reading this mag. front to back. We have sent subscipts to all our younger family members. To this day my nephew @ 11 yrs uses it for book reports in school. Can't say enough wonderful things. Thank you to the editors of Ranger Rick. P.S. we also ordered the 2 younger series for babys and toddlers love them just as much. I highly suggest for everyone, @ 40 yrs I am learning new things and love it. My son LOVES the Ranger Rick Adventures (comic). You will be thrilled every month 
I thought since Zoobooks is such a hit in my house that my son would enjoy Ranger Rick. That is not the case, but he does enjoy having this magazine between the mailings of Zoobooks. Ranger Rick arrives always on the first of the month or thereabouts. It is more punctual than Zoobooks. I have never had to call to ask where the current issue was. The focus is on animals and published by National Wildlife Federation. There are poems, fun pages, photos, letters and more. I think that the focus is on activities and not so much pictures of animals. My son can peruse through the Ranger Rick in one sitting and then says he has read it through. He does not refer back to the issues as often as he does with the Zoobooks. There are more pages in each issue. The Sep 2005 has 39 pages. This issue has pelicans, bears and mini beasts. It does not spotlight one animal for each issue. We have saved each issue and will be renewing. Teachers can get a free gtuide online to the magazine 
This is a light and colorful newspaper. I remember when it first came out .The idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the United States as a whole. It does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. The reporting itself is clear and very readable. The paper lacks weight and depth. It has a lot of variety in its features, and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable. It's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting. And there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers. 
I got a free subscription to this newspaper and I am thoroughly enjoying it. The Olympics coverage was wonderful along with the color pics. I like their editorial pages too and my favorite part is the Life section. I love the color pics and the celebrity news and the reality TV news synopsis. I used to only read this paper when travelling or on vacation. Now I am reading it daily and they may have a subscriber for life 
as a subscriber to the washington post and a reader of usa today i can say that usa is just alot more interesting. sure it may not have all the details, but it give enough information without making it boring. the color is great as are the graphs and feature articles. it may not be good for a buisnessman looking for information but the usa today is just fine for everyday news 
This paper offers a wonderful broad perspective, and great national coverage. Doesn't take too long, but always has plenty to read. Every american should read this paper. And every adult should check out the "New Sex Now" dvd 
Ever since USA Today started publishing, it has been made fun of. And can't understand why. This a great paper that gives its readers the facts that they need to get though the day. One of the main reason that I enjoy USA Today it has little advertisements,unlike my local paper. It also give me news from everystate. USA Today is great paper for readers looking for just the facts and not alot of fluff 
Its a good magazine that doesn't have hysterical or over hyped pieces. While I do not always agree with the conclusions of the writers, the magazine does what Time, Newsweek etc do not do. Make one think. I also applaud them for being honest and having articles taking the currant administration to task for failings and for being honest in challenging conservatives to get their act together. While William Kristol and Fred Barnes are often noted as being the most notable at the magazine I actually like other writers like John Simon, William Doino Jr, Vance Serchuk (who wrote a great review of a book I own The White Man's Burden Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good by William Easterly),John Podhoretz, Gerard Alexander. Now I know as far as subscriptions go the price may seem high. But I suggest you subscribe and then donate the copies to your local library. They will appreciate the gift. I also have to note that I really love the artists who do the covers and that as a subscriber I can also read issues online 
I read part of the 'Weekly Standard' each week online. I do not know if that means I qualify to review the paper as a whole. I find its articles informative and straightforward. There is a certain economy about the publication. It seems to me sometimes as if it is a kind of 'Wall Street Journal' in color. I suppose one reason I do not take objection to it in any serious way is that I most often agree with its politics. When I read its articles I feel I am getting the most for my money in the short time it takes me. 
The Weekly Standard clearly has a conservatinve "bent." However, it is not the sort that screams, "This is the ONLY way to think about this topic." It is thoughtful commentary, delivered with well crafted writing. I come away from reading an issue thinking that I have been well informed 
Although I'm a Casey Democrat, meaning a social conservative and a fiscal progressive, I enjoy the Weekly Standard as probably the best neo-conservative magazine on the market. I find it timely, informative, provocative and in-depth in terms of its coverage of issues. I particularly like their "Week in Review" feature, whereby they review events of the week and provide some pointed commentary. But where I particularly came to appreciate the Weekly Standard is in the debate over moral issues -- they offered innovative and clear arguments in favor of traditional family values, using solid research and up-to-date statistics from numerous different disciplines, while avoiding the usual worn rhetoric of the family values crowd (among which I include myself as a Casey Democrat.) 
My daughter LOVED this magazine and couldn't wait to take it to Grandma's house to make the recipe's and do the projects. She's now into Spider age level but when I have my 2nd child I'll be ordering this magazine again for them 
These are SOOOOOOO great. The pictures really help the kids to learn the words, and the entire product is first class. A really fun monthly mailer that parents and kids alike will enjoy 
No ads. Large print. Beautiful illustrations. Interesting age appropriate stories. Every magazine by this publisher (Cricket, etc) are all quality magazines that are child centered. My daughter is five. I think this is a bit young for her but she loves it and 'reads' it cover to cover. She also enjoys looking at the pictures as well. This is worth every penny. 
I have a one yr old who enjoys Babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys Ladybug. These are just THE BEST children's publications. We save every Babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic. Can't recommend these enough to family and friends. 
I love these magazines. We subscribe to Ladybug, Spider, and Cricket (each for a different child). The stories are great, as is the illustration. An illustrator friend of mine says that it is very prestigious to be asked to illustrate a story in these magazines, and I figure it is the same for the stories. No advertising, of course. The thing I like the best is that each magazine is geared toward a certain age of child. Highlights tries to be something for everyone, so we look through the magazine to find an appropriate story. In Ladybug, we just start at the beginning and read straight through. As the publisher will tell you, when your child outgrows Ladybug, you just let them know and they change your subscription to Spider (and later, Cricket. That's as far as we've gotten) 
We received this magazine as a gift subscription last December. Beautiful illustrations and interesting short stories with large letters so they are easy for children to read. My daughter (age 4) can read some of them herself, my son (age 3) looks at the words and the pictures and listens to my daughter read and I have even enjoyed reading this magazine from time to time. This is a great children's magazine! I recommend this magazine for children who have just learned to read and for children and parents to read together 
Product was shipped promptly and asrrived as described by seller. Would recommend to anyone 
I've been an off-and-on subscriber to SI since I was a kid. I've grown to love the magazine and idolize a few of the staff writers. Despite being the best, the magazine is far from perfect. Lately, I've found that many of the articles deal with things that I, and many sports fans, probably don't care about. And they give too much coverage to pro football when it's in season, even though I've noticed that the football coverage is among the worst in the magazine. There are a few writers who I can't stand (die Austin Murphy!) and some who think they are better than they really are (Rick Reilly), and some who are underappreciated (Steve Rushin). However, some of the finest reading I've ever done has been in Sports Illustrated. There are some stories that stick with you for years. SI beats the crap out of the terrible ESPN magazine, which seems more interested in comedy than in sports. 
You've got to take your hat off to Fangoria. Whether their style of gory, visceral coverage of the horror genre appeals to you or not you can't deny their success. The fact that they've been doing it for 20 years is really a marvel in the world of magazines, let alone genre magazines. Fangoria is still tops in terms of their production values and photography although newer mags like Rue Morgue and some of the imports are certainly as good. Fangoria each month checks in with a very large array of reviews of both current releases and older releases that you may have missed. Since many of these films go direct to video, chances are you probably did miss them. Besides movies they also cover Horror fiction and non-fiction, TV and even a smattering of music where appropriate. If there's a minor complaint about Fangoria it's that sometimes they come off a bit fannish and perhaps not as critical of movies as they should be. Honestly I've watched movies they've given favorable reviews to and wondered just what in the heck they were smoking when they watched. The other complaint would be that they devote almost no space to classic horror, but that's just a pet peeve 
Fangoria always has and always will be the greatest horror magazine around. Terrific on the set previews of the latest films, retrospectives on classic films ,dvd reviews and always dependable for bloody photo's from your favorite movies 
Fangoria has always been the first rate magazine for horror movie freaks. Nothing else comes close: if you're in love with horror movies look no further-this mag has been out for over twenty years 
I totally love this magazine I would marry it in a heartbeat even though Ive never had a subscription 
When WEIRD TALES was revived around 1988, I was sorely disappointed in the direction the editorial staff had taken. It was too "progressive" and not enough like the old WT so many of us afficionados knew and loved. Lin Carter had a great thing going for the four paperback issues he came out with under the Zebra imprint in the early 1980's. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to continue. His idea was to keep the FLAVOR of the old WEIRD TALES alive, and he did it very well. Then several years later along comes the the Schweitzer/Scithers/Betancourt WT, and my goodness it was sad to see the aura gone. Gradually, though, WT has seemed to come along and put itself somewhat more in the direction of the "old-fashioned" 'zine it was in its heyday (1920's-1930's), although the editor Darrell Schweitzer would probably disagree with this observation. Anyway, WT sports great covers now, good stories, and good book reviews, and interesting editorials. I must say I miss S.T. Joshi's always very entertaining book reviews, but we can't have everything. Scott Connors' forthcoming reviews will surely entertain, as do Douglas Winter's. All fantasy lovers should buy this magazine to support the cause of fantastic literature, especially the dark fantastic; there are so few outlets of this kind now that WHISPERS and WEIRDBOOK, not to mention the long gone FORGOTTEN FANTASY, are no longer published. Good job, Mr. Schweitzer, whether you realize it or not, your magazine has become a more cozy, old-style, aesthetically pleasing magazine, more in the true tradition of the original WEIRD TALES, thanks in no small part to the wonderful covers that have graced it in the last 13 or 14 years 
I was surfing the net and I happened upon this site. It is obviously a amatures site, but it is chock full of valuable information. The photos on the site were vivid and intriguing. Not to mention that this site actually has links available for use when I was ready to book my travel. I discovered things to do in my destination location prior to leaving the comfort of my home and well in advance of taking my trip. As a long time traveler I highly recommend this site to any and everyone who travels. So give them a chance they are at http://www.mytravelscenes.com 
This reader thoroughly enjoys the photos and articles about 'exotic' vacations in Europe, Asia, the Southern Hemisphere (New Zealand] and Central or South America ... one can dream ... and possibly one day live the dream. One learns of vacations in out-of-the-way unique locales. For instance, in the July 2004 issue, there is a feature article on "Puglia' dubbed "the next Tuscany". There one can rent space in a 15th century convent or room at the most modern resort. In either case, one can taste the finest Italian cuisine, fresh food, grown and raised in the region. Another adventure which appeals to this reader is "perfume tours in Provence". This reader is in love with Mayan ruins, so reading about how Richard Hansen, an U.C.L.A. archeologist, has worked for 25 years to excavate and preserve, El Mirador, one of the largest mayan cities, is of great value. This reader shares his dream to designate the region a national monument and turn it into a living outdoor museum. It would become a top tourist attraction, such as the Tikal National Park (Guatemala's most popular). Another fascinating article featured "Shanghai". Here one learns of where to shop for silk slippers and the beautiufl blue and white porcelain for which it is famous. A person can have designer clothes copied by tailors at huge savings ... The contrast of ancient and modern China is amazing. Going antique shopping would be most satisfying ... Featuring, Ming Tsai, a Chinese chef and owner of "The Blue Ginger" Restaurant in Massachsetts is quite the perfect ending to a wonderful magazine. He is often featured on PBS channels sharing his recipes and techniques for Chinese cooking. This reader enjoys every article and looks forward to each monthly issure. Highest recommendations.

Ladies Home Journal provides practical advice on how busy women can be happier and more effective. The articles are straightforward, easy to read, interesting, and assume the reader is intelligent (which is more than I can say for many women's magazines). I especially like the health and fitness news because it usually pertains to women exclusively. The celebrity interviews are fun, too, and the recipes are easy enough for anyone to follow and enjoy. I give it four stars because I can always find at least one topic that really interests me in each issue 
Video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives. Yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems. That has been the case with one of the biggest-selling ones of all time, Gamepro. They truly have made it one the most provocative and well in-depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers, and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works. The magazine is quite well, but I honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for Gamecube and Game Boy Advance, when most of it primarily focuses in on Playstation 2 Xbox. Yet, Gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer's magazine. Anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games, this magazine is worth reading. Overall: B 1/2 
This magazine covers every aspect of horror/suspense culture, such as comics, books, music and of course, movies. The writers of the articles have respect for the craft involved in the subject, and don't just dwell on blood and gore (but have no fear, there is plenty of that). Whoever designs the layout of this magazine does a beautiful job. Lots of glossy photos and intriguing artwork, too. Give this one a try. I'll bet you'll love it as much as I do 
This is probably the best magazine I subscribe to. Over the past 5 years I've noticed the quality of my other subscribed videogame magazines to have deteriorated dramatically. But this one stays true. I thought by now one would see a drop in quality, but the quality of the writing just keeps getting stronger and stronger. The demo disc, for example, continues to stay chock with demos of most current and even retro games. The quality of on-line reviews is and continues to get better! I love the CD Rom video tips, and even enjoy just watching the videos of new and upcoming games. Other magazines, especially ones like Gamepro, act like they give you demos, but this is the only magazine that has a demo disc each ad every month. I have even seen these demos for sale on auctions sites on-line (including the Big one that starts with E). I'm one of those gamers that rarely pays full price for videogames, and I appreciate being able to play the demo of some of them, until I feel like paying for them. Amazon is a great site to get used videogames on the cheap, and I appreciate the reviews helping me to make a decision to buy the game. Hope this review helps somebody. MC White said: CHECK IT OUT!! 
I've subscribed to OPM for four years now, and in that time I've never had any subscription or delivery problems. The writing staff is very intimate with their readers; it's almost like reading a magazine that a bunch of your friends wrote up. The reviews have mostly been spot-on for my tastes (compared to the awful, laughable insanity of PSM), and even though the Ziff-Davis crew members are "Official," they are fair. Also, and this is very, very important to me, their use of the English language does NOT suck like it does in PSM. The staff at PSM seem to be drunk most of the time, or maybe they just didn't make it through the second grade, I'm not sure - but their mishandling of prose is the main reason I dropped that subscription like a hot potato. OPM on the other hand seems to be written by college grads at least, and I appreciate that. Easy to read, filled with thoughtful insight, fair reviews, and a heaping helping of socially balanced humor, OPM is bar-none the best Playstation magazine you can buy 
The articles are fun I've learned alot of useful information, like last month's article on depression - the fish oil exercise worked almost immediately. It's not a professional or academic journal - if you're a general person on the street, you will learn a lot about psychology 
Before buying a subscription to this magazine I would suggest reading through an issue first, just so you are aware of what you'll be getting. No, it's not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking, and the articles aren't scholarly or journal-worthy. But.. the articles make the subject accessible to the average reader, and do include insights into human behaviors and relationships that are fun and interesting. I am always engaged reading the articles, and find them topical and very current, unlike some psychology magazines which are too `deep' and drenched in older principles. This is a very `hip' psychology magazine and would be appreciated by those who are not necessarily scholars in the subject but who have a genuine interest in learning more. My favorite part is looking through the recommended books section, because there is usually something worthwhile to read 
May be pricy, but it's hard to beat. Can order significantly cheaper direct through www.uncutsubs.co.uk 
great magazine....my favorite!!!! if you dont like the price here, go to uncuts home site and subscribe at about $7 per issue 
very much lives up to it's name by focusing on the Past the present. the free offer of a Disc makes this cool. the magazine has some really good Interviews as well 
Some times I feel like it was written just for me. The music articles cover everything from classic rock and punk through the best of what is going on today. The movie articles have a great balance between reevaluating the great 70s and 80s films and new movies. Plus the free CDs every month are usually outstanding and have introduced me to new music I would have missed. It's an absolute must have 
This is the one that I subscribe to, even though, strictly speaking, Q magazine does a better job of covering contempo musica mondo. Uncut is for those of us who feel nostalgic for popular music figures whose stuff has held up over time. The writing is superior, VASTLY superiour to anything in print today. This is because the mag is staffed by geezers who cut their teeth writing for the likes of the NME and probably something like the top of the pops back in the day. The writers are veterans and this is good for a number of reasons, among them is that they bring great perspective, journalistic professionalism, acute insights, otherwise forgotten trivia and the realization there is more to life than just listening to the tunes, i.e. there is a whole other culture happening simultaneously, to their writing. Actually, apart from the FEATURE ARTIST feature, this magazine is more about film, past and present, and I love this aspect of it because the editors choose an actor, director, genre or actor/director and focus in on the oevre of xhosen subject and then just lay out a whole wackawackapacka stuff that you are definitely going to go out and buy/ rent/ borrow and view. I ALWAYS find a new movie that I have just GOT to watch after reading my latest edition of UNCUT. Plus, each issue comes with a complimentary CD. The selections on these CD's is spotty and I find that the poor ones I spin through just a couple of times, the good ones, I keep and play lots. You won't be sorry that you subscribed to this mag but you will likely be sorry that you didn't if you ever get the chance to see what you missed by not doing so 
Well, it might not be quite the same level as Rolling Stone, remember clout and tradition have something to do with the interviews THEY can get. The writing and reviews are a lot better... since it's British it gives quite a different spin on things and emphasizes other than the mainstream. The downside is the price...You do get a free cd, which is cool I guess 
I picked up a copy of British Vogue when I had finished reading my American Vogue for the month, interested in the British Vogue and its take on fashion, plus I've had subscriptions to British magazines in the past and was impressed with them. There are many, many things that set this magazine apart from American Vogue. First, this magazine's main focus is fashion. They devote more space to models than celebrities, socialites, or noblility types. They don't only focus on the high and unreachable fashions but also feature more affordable clothing (granted, its mostly at British stores, but the thought counts) . The articles in British Vogue are more educated, and they cover more ground. Another thing I really liked was that this magazine not only shows fashions and trends but also shows you HOW to put them together, what mixes with what, and what you should be looking at getting. They also talk about staple pieces in this magazine, how and where to buy those. This magazine also has a pride for country that you don't see in the U.S. anymore which is a breath of fresh air. The snootiness of American Vogue, the parading around couture only, the $900 first night sets and whatnot are left out of this magazine. It almost seems like this magazine is more practical than its American counterpart. Lastly, this magazine is of higher quality, with full, glossy pages, a glossy cover, and is overall about 2 inches bigger all the way around than its American counterpart. This magazine is very, very good, I just wish a subscription were more affordable. 
as a high school student aspiring to attend art school, nylon has provided me with countless sources of inspiration in their creative photography, layout, and decoration. i look forward to reading the magazine each month, and i honestly devour every last word and picture. nylon is a creative, whimsical and fantastic magazine. i highly reccomend it to anyone interested in a fashion magazine that goes beyond a "beach read. 
Since the first time I picked up Nylon a few years ago, I fell in love. The layout is great (as an artist, I'm always inspired by the great pictures). It offers a great variety of articles pertaining to music, fashion, art and pop culture. It's definitely a great escape from the masses of bubblegum girly fashion mags that dominate these days 
I first picked up a copy of Nylon in Chicago, while browsing the newsstands. I wasn't sure if I would like it--years of subscribing to Vogue, Elle, and some stupid tweeny magazines had almost put me off magazine-reading for good. And yet I always manage to be drawn to the racks. Nylon was different from the get go. They always feature unknowns on the cover, and when, on occassion, a well-known celebrity is featured, the stories give us a new perspective on them. Nylon is worth purchasing for the layout in itself. I could spend hours paging through each feature, marveling at the graphics, and the way the magazine is put together. I love how they base some of the beauty section on famous movies or bands. Nylon also makes a point of covering bands, movies, and fashion designers that, until now, have remained obscure. Everything they feature is amazing--most of the music they recommend ends up on my Amazon wishlist! I would highly recommend Nylon to anyone and everyone. This obscure magazine will stun you with its amazing artistic layout, and introduce you to new products you may have never discovered 
I have been reading History Today for years. It covers largely European, and especially British, history, with occasional articles on American and world history. Articles are written by established scholars and sound popular historians, such as Antonia Fraser and Alison Weir, and are accompanied by brief bibliographies. Illustrations are usually drawn from sources contemporary with the subject of the article. Its only drawback for Americans is the price. However, after years of freeloading in libraries, I decided to get a subscription. Believe me, it is worth it. 
I've been very pleased with my subscription to Fine Cooking. As another reviewer mentioned, it's printed on nice quality paper, and on every page are at least 4-5 pictures in full color. The pictures are certainly helpful, but the recipes are also fantastic, and the nifty calorie chart at the end (a la Cooking Light) is a nice touch. Also, it doesn't have a distracting ad in between every other page like Bon Appetit. My only complaint is that it doesn't come twice a month 
This is the one only cooking/food magazine to buy. Not only does it share fabulous recipes that are tested in the magazine's test kitchens, it also illustrates step-by-step instruction, rates cooking tools gadgets, educates the reader on seasonal ingredients 
Like the others on here, I have to give Fine Cooking 5 stars. Pros - The price is worth it, there are delectable pictures for every recipes. The mag is on high gloss and beautiful to look at. - There are recipes in them that make an average cook a better cook, even if you don't use a recipe it gives you ideas. - Reviews of new gadgets - Focus on a specific food, like vanilla. - The company when I contacted them about a type of recipe I was looking for took the time to go through their back issues and send me full color copies of what they could find on the subject - that was very cool. Cons - I have one issue where I didn't find one recipe I wanted to make. - I use maybe 2-3 recipes out of each issue. I'm just not willing to devote hours to making a dish that while it looks beautiful I don't like the ingredients in it. - They use alcohol for some recipes where it's crucial for the flavoring, bad part is I don't drink/use alcohol. I made a big pot of beef stew from an issue where red wine was the main flavor. I tried to substitute but a can of Dinty Moore stew tasted better. If you really want to know what's in it. Check out their website, they have recipes from the issues. Or browse through them at the store and see if it's what you're looking for. So far after many a search Fine Cooking is the best I've come across that can appease to the stay at home cook and the gourmet looking for a challenge. You might also want to follow the contributors. I found my best bread chef Peter Rienhart from it. The Focaccia in one issue is so good you'll drool, even though it takes two days to make 
Fine Cooking takes a somewhat Consumer Reports-like approach to cooking, much in the manner of Cook's Illustrated. But there are several key differences that set FC apart and make it superior to CI: 1. In FC, not all the voices sound alike. In CI, every article, no matter who writes it, sounds as though it were written by the same person. I understand why they do this (keeping the focus on the food not personality, maintaining consistency), but it gives the magazine a creepy, musty, claustrophic, Stepford Wives-like quality. This is magnified by the fact that there are no "outsiders" allowed into the CI kitchen--no visiting experts, no star chefs, just the CI staff and their identical voices. 2. In FC there's no Christopher Kimball essays: CI's bow-tied editor fills up an entire page in an already thin magazine with a folksy, Prairie Home Companion-like homily on why owning a large, upscale farm in rural New England makes him morally superior to everyone else, replete with a recurring cast of curmudgeonly cranks and crackpots--all of which has absolutely nothing to do with any of the food in the issue, or with the lives of anyone else on the planet, with the possible exception of Martha Stewart. It's an embarrassing, self-indulgent soapbox. But he is leader of the cult, so don't expect his sermons to dispappear any time soon. 3. CI advertises itself as "ad-free"--and then proceeds to glut its pages with print ads and blow-in cards touting CI's cottage industry of recycled books. I'd rather peruse the offerings of FC's advertisers, whose products are at least potentially useful to me. 4. FC has no constantly recycled material. For such a supposedly modest operation, CI puts out a staggering number of books, many of them single-topic tomes that borrow heavily from the recipes already printed in the magazine, as well as from other, previously published CI books (and there's an evil twin in the "America's Test Kitchen" series of books and DVDs). You're likely to find the same pie crust or tomato sauce recipe in about 16 different books. The incestuous nature of this recipe factory casts an unflattering mercenary shadow across the CI mission. 5. FC offers superior quality production methods. The glossy paper and attractive, full-color photos in FC put CI's faux-downhome matte paper and hand-drawn illustrations to shame. 6. FC has much more variety. FC also has its own group of regular contributors, but they are supplemented in each issue with experts from a variety of fields in the culinary arts (and who write in their own unique voice--imagine that!), giving the magazine a broader scope and a much fresher feel than CI, which tends to stick to a standard set of All-American classics, which they recycle every five years (how many times can you revamp "The Secrets of Macaroni and Cheese"?). Give Fine Cooking a look. It's hands-down the best food magazine for home cooks 
I highly recommend Biblical Archaeology Review. My only regret is that I did not subscribe sooner. This is a must have magazine for the serious Biblical scholar 
I once asked the Regius Professor of Hebrew at the University of Cambridge how he stays abreast of fast-moving developments in biblical archaeology, a field of investigation that is related but decidely peripheral to his own work. 'I mostly read BAR ... ', he said, in an unexpectedly low-brow response for the hallowed halls of the Great University. 'Then if I want to know more about a topic, I move on to more scholarly publications.' It was a vote of confidence in a magazine (*not* an academic journal!) that I've read for years and found equally useful in maintaining a generalist knowledge in an area of investigation that - let's address the elephant in the room - most of us come to out of religious interests. BAR effectively combines the well-edited prose of leading scholars with due general-interest attention to color photos and complementary resources like slides (in a past era) and phenomenally well-produced videos and dvds. An issue pulled at random from my shelves (November/December 2001) contains articles entitled: -Excavating Philistine Gath. Have we found Goliath's hometown -The Monastery of the Cross. Where heaven and earth meet -The Rise and Fall of the Dead Sea -Is It or Isn't It - a Synagogue? In addition, the usual suspects appear issue by issue in interesting columns that add color commentary to a polemical field where personalities as well as artefacts and theories loom large. You'll want to ignore the over-heated reader responses on one brand of disillusionment or another. But you'd be wrong to heed some reviewers' critiques of the political headbashing that goes on among archaeologists. When elephants of this kind collide, it's usually over an ideological argument that matters. It does us no good to deride such battles as mere politics. BAR has had the good sense to play both a spectator's and a provocateur's role in such infighting over the complaints of readers who wish things were more placid around here. They are not. And the things we continue to dig up from the rocky ground of Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and other locations continue to insure that we never fall prey to boring consensus regarding the history of these great lands and the faiths they engendered. Read BAR if this sounds remotely interesting and decide for yourself 
The first issue was very interesting and look forward to the next one 
I've subscribed to BAR for at least 6 years now, and I enjoy the mix of articles on Holy Land archeology and related topics. The current events reported are informative and useful. The book reviews are helpful for guiding further reading in the field. I recommend it highly. My only complaint about the content would be that the editor tends to focus on controversies in the press and in the field that perhaps merit less attention than he gives it. Of course, it seems self-serving on his part to keep beating drums, but it is never dull. Probably sells a few extra copies evry month as well. A little background on myself: BA degree in anthropology, ordained elder in the Presbyterian Church, USA. I have worked in a public school for 20 years now. 
BAR presents an overall terrific introduction to the world of Biblical artifacts! Professional archaeologists world-renowned scholars distill their dry, black-and-white academic publications into a language ordinary, non-technical people can understand put to use when they study the Bible. What I like in particular is their presentation of vivid color photos that bring the artifacts excavation sites to life! I appreciate BAR for introducing me to material I never knew existed that complements the Biblical record helps demonstrate its reliability (such as the mysterious LMLK seal impressions made during the lifetimes of King Hezekiah the great prophet Isaiah, which inspired me to write my own book on the subject--also available here at Amazon). My only complaint is that the editor occasionally publishes statements by archaeologists/scholars as facts when they actually represent atheistic/theistic biases in disguise. Fortunately, a Letters to the Editor section provides a forum for readers to challenge the experts, which makes for some interesting, often entertaining reading 
French Vogue is a magazine which is published in french and is directed towards the people of France, and anyone else who is interested in the tops in fashion, art, books, movies, as well as health, beauty, and fitness issues. Vogue is for the person who is either "In", who who wants to be. It is often heavy laden with photos and articles on celebrities, and contains the usual array of advertisements directed at the Jetset. Vogue, especially the french, italian, and german versions are very highly collectible. And you don't have to keep them a thousand years for them to be worth any money. Many Vogue's have come right off the press and became immediate collectibles. So this is another reason to have a subscription to this fine publication. I own a subscription to Vogue, and I WILL renew my subscription, not only because it is a collectible, but I truly love the almost artistic photography, and the intriguing articles each issue brings. If you want a magazine that brings you the best the world has to offer, if you desire a magazine that not only makes you look forward to getting it every month, but also could be a decent investment for the future, you'll want to subscribe to this publication. 
I discovered this "magazine" while employed as the Reference and Instructional Librarian at a Culinary College. The four annual HARDCOVER issues arrive with just one ad - the back cover. The recipe quantities are typically for a family size rather than the mass serving quantities. This is important to note because this magazine IS very much oriented towards the professional or the very advanced amateur chef. Profiles and articles tend to focus on the needs of the Professional. One patron (a local sous chef who had graduated from a different culinary school some years earlier) began swearing a blue streak after thumbing through a few issues. When I confronted him about the outburst, he apologized and explained his behavior. For three years, he had worked under a local chef and been amazed at the creativity of the chef in coming up with new recipes for the restaurant. After thumbing through the issues, my patron had realized an ugly truth - their entire menu was being cribbed from Art Culinaire. When I told him I had at my disposal a large stack of subscription forms, he immediately took one saying, "Next time, I'll be ahead of him." Each issue is large enough and beautiful enough to double as a coffee table book (the paper quality and pictures are easily superior to most cookbooks), but you will want to keep every sauce-splattered issue as close to the stove as you can with burning the pages. There is no other magazine to compare it to and very few cookbooks that can match it 
Art Culinaire is probably one of the absolute BEST magazines available to the culinary industry. Currently, I'm a culinary student and I have thoroughly enjoyed looking through each copy of Art Culinaire as my school has received it. Granted, the price is a bit steep when you're only getting four issues, but when those issues are bound like a book... They'll last far, far longer than any other magazine, no matter how careful you are with the others. Myself, I'm looking forward to having some cash free so I can get a subscription 
This is an outstanding publication. Unlike most magazines and books, this is the real deal with full recipes from leading chefs. I simply do not understand why it is so hard to find. These recipes are complicated, but if you like to cook, you'll find this inspirational. Everything is well photographed. It doesn't get any better than this 
What a tough job these guys have -- searching the globe for only Perfect 10's! The girls are gorgeous, and the pictures are fantastic. They're not usually sexy shots, though. They're glamour shots 
This magazine is GREAT. It covers the things you may know in history, but also tells the 'whole story'. The stories cover from 1492 to Post WWII. This magazine is the only one I have found that tells the full whole history in a easy to read interesting format. I would reccomend it for all Americans who want to know the true interesting history of America and not the shallow 3 minute news driven or HollyWood slanted history 
This is an excellent magazine about American History. The magazine provides a wide range of stories on a bi-monthly basis. It doesn't repeat the same stories that most people know but it tries to tell instances that are not as well-known. In some cases it is little known stories about significant events and other times they have stories about little known pieces of American History. I only wish the magazine had a monthly publication 
This is perhaps my favorite Photography magazine. The printing is fantastic as is the subject matter. I really like the fact there are no ads in it at all. So many photography mags are just an extended catalog for B or Adorama that this is a breath of fresh air. The photography itself is second to none. Always something interesting and fresh 
There's a lot to like about Lenswork - the selection of images, the quality of the printing, Bill Jay's "End Notes" - but the thing I like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment. Brooks Jensen (the editor/publisher) doesn't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph, or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it. All that matters is the image. And after you've finished looking at the images, you'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue, too. Highly Recommended 
This magazine is ill! I learn about all the new albums coming out, read the review,and if they say they are good, i go out and buy 'em. The reviews are also accurate, giving the appropiate number of stars. I also love the sections on the new artists on the verge. The cover stories never seem to dis-please me, always givin' me plent of info. The mini articles are cool, too, from stuff like Warren's Sapp's all-star football team, to all about how Mike Jones was discovered. One last thing I love about the magazine - they are never thin issues, and you know what that means!!! 
For the price Vibe is okay, but it lost it's sizzle somewhere during the last five years. I look forward to Vibe Vixen, perhaps it will stir up my interests again. True, there are a lot of ads now, but the articles are interesting. What I miss about the magazine is that it seems like they never "break" any news anymore. Perhaps it's the Internet's fault, but I remember a time when the details of an artists Vibe interview really created a buzz (like in 99 when Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes balked to Vibe her personal feelings about the "Fan Mail" album), but now everything is just pretty mediorcre with this magazine. It's also totally predictable. When someone they consider "hot" has a product coming out you know they will be on the cover, and when I saw Pharrell and Gwen Stefani on the cover I thought that was a bit of a stretch. It's still a good magazine but I find I enjoy Blender and Sister 2 Sister much better, but for the price I will continue to support this magazine 
man i love this but some of the items are to high and my wife dont like dat so please lower dem or i will sue u alright 
I've been a subscriber for the past 2 years and since then I've stopped reading The Source almost completly. I can't believe I wasted my money like that. This magazine is everything.. you get the latest 411 on da lastest fashion, issues affecting our communites, close up, personal interviews with the top names in Hip Hop and the column in the back where they discuss the unusual things going on in question 
I started a subscription for my granddaughter, now four, a couple years ago. She loves animals, and loves Your Big Backyard. Goes through it from cover to cover. I'd highly recommend it. 
This is an excellent nature magazine. It is exactly what it looks like - a magazine about the world and the animals in it. There is an ongoing hunt for the little bird and other little animal that are hidden in the magazine each month. It is a fun magazine with drawings by children, cute pictures and posters, stories, information and more. A great subscription for the prereading crowd. 
One thing I like about it is the little books inside that you get to put together. I like the comics and the animal stories and the games and the pictures of animals and a poster inside. There are also song tracks with different kinds of pictures instead of words. It's real fun to read! The games are awesome! Also you can send pictures of yourself or that you draw to the magazine 
This is a great magazine for preschool/early elementary kids. We have renewed it twice and enjoy watching our son learn more with each issue. The editors do a great job of publishing intersting and unique facts about many different kids of animals 
My son has loved this magazine and is in his third year as a subscriber. He loves getting an interesting magazine in the mail each month. I love that it has good emergent reader level content this is focused so that different bits of content throughout the magazine reinforce the same concepts. My son especially loves the mini-books that come in each magazine and we generally have to make those as soon as they come. As an educator, I love that the content is at the right level and that it is actually educational in contrast to some magazines. This magazine is reasonably priced and still has NO advertising. I am so thankful that the publishers have made that decision and I will keep subscribing to this until it is time to move up to Ranger Rick. I did have to sort out a problem with the publisher because we had recieved two gift subscriptions. I called and they were able to make the two subscriptions run back to back, so instead of two magazines each month, we have two years of subscription and they assure me that whenever it is time to move to Ranger Rick, we can apply any unused Big Backyard to the Ranger Rick subscription. They were very polite to me and solved my problem efficiently 
I rarely write reviews but couldn't believe what I read by the other reviewers, most of whom focused on how ritzy the lifestyles of the parents depicted in the articles are, how "expensive" the clothes are, how pretty the moms (models) are, etc...This is a magazine. Don't we expect some kind of facade? Other "Parenting" magazines may APPEAR to be more about and for "real" parents, but this is no more than their chosen tactic. As with any publication whose foundational goal is to sell more advertising, they wouldn't be doing this unless they believed it was going to work. They are selling a certain "lifestyle" just like CHILD magazine is. If it's more in accordance with yours, fine. But why trash another just because it's different? CHILD Magazine isn't perfect. But at least it doesn't pander. Does anyone really want to see what Target's latest attempt at toddler fashion is when they open a magazine? I'd rather just check for myself the next time I'm out buying diapers. If you value solid writing above all else in a magazine, then CHILD Magazine is for you. (And whether you can afford that $90 pair of toddler shorts on page 28 won't be such an issue.) 
I like this magazine for a lot of reasons, but my admiration is primarily for their willingness to provide solid, thoughtful reporting without pandering to the lowest-common-denomiator reader. This is not to say it's a high-brow publication--it's not. Rather, Child carefully avoids publishing the type of mindless pap that so many parenting publications pack into every issue (i.e., "25 Ways to Tie your Shoes!" or "Picnics with Peanut Butter!" or "What Your Child's Doctor Won't Tell You About Lice!"). Child is a well written, well designed magazine that is readable, informative and, frankly, cheap. I can't ask for more than that 
If you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis, Forbes and Fortune are the two conventional choices. I started reading Fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when I realized that the business people with whom I associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages. It fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits. Fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends. You won't find anything radical here, but you need to have read it if this kind of news, analysis, and opinion fits your job description or personal interests. There is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson' in each edition. For me, the highlight is Stanley Bing's delicious, irreverent, and every so slightly jaded backpage column. I routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at Bing's corporate lunacy as I do. Fortune is behind the eponymous Fortune 500 and other derivative lists. For me, one of the most valuable is the magazine's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue', though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests. Other readers will tear out or access other Fortune lists online with equal interest. If you're in business or work with people who are, you'd better be reading Fortune or Forbes or both 
"Fortune" is a classic on the newsstand, and is as vital and important today as ever. "Fortune" generally caters to people with a managerial bent, especially upper-level executives, but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world, the global and national economic climate, and forward-looking technology and trend information. Each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story, like the Enron trial, or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year. I do enjoy the articles where they rank things, but more than the rankings themselves, I am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings; while I don't always agree with the magazine, I do always find it good food for thought. The features are generally very polished and accurate, and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a CEO as to a college business student. I particularly appreciate the interviews that "Fortune" has with key players in the financial industry, and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue. The magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like "Kiplinger's." Nonetheless, the investment advice and insight "Fortune" offers should generally be held in high esteem. I also appreciate the coverage of key trends, and in particular want to note that "Fortune" has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in America: coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader. Many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money; while there are several I would recommend, "Fortune" remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends, and should be a part of everyone's business library 
Detailed articles, and interesting columns. Balanced, and not afraid to be critical where appropriate. 
This is the best business and money magazine out there. They cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you didn't think of. 
Of the Big 3 (FORTUNE, Forbes, and BusinessWeek), I like FORTUNE the most. BusinessWeek feels like it's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing. Forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose---to report and analyze the business world. FORTUNE profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way BusinessWeek does 
Good magazine. if you like video games, this is an unbiased, very informative magazine with great reviews 
Talk about a hella sweeet magazine! I love this magazine, and have been subscribing since I was a little kid of 35 years of age. Bangin' reviews, bangin' cover stories. I like it tons more than other competition, such as GamePro. I highly recommend it! In a way, this magazine actually reminds me a lot of GamePro. The formatting is almost the same. But the article writing is 10 times better than anything out of GamePro, over the last 2 or 3 years. I can't quite put my finger on what differentiates EGM from GamePro, but its noticeable, and much more refreshing than GamePro. Sorry to compare it so much, but they are virtually the same, but EGM is better. It just is. MC White said: Check it out 
This magazine is... well... sweet. I love it. I picked up a subscription in January and i think it's great. They get previews on a ton of games, even those that aren't that gossiped about. They bring a vieraty in opinions when it comes to there reviews. They get a scoped up article on new games very fast. They're not centered on only the good games, but they also include a "shame of the month" (lowest scoring game of the month) award. They include three scores from a scale of 1-10 and the reviewers simply put out the truth and down right say that a game sucks. They have full coverage on new platforms and games. They also include posters and stragety guides with some of their issuses. This magazine is alot better than the Dragonball Z obssessed, GamePro. Its fast and relibel. Definetly a great buy. 
I've had a subscription to this magazine for three years and gave never had a problem with the magazine. I love this magazine, it gives good reviews of games with objective point of views. The editorials and articles are humorous and factual. 
Many gaming magazines suffer from spam.Each page is littered with junky ads.Although EGM doesn't have the constant spam,or atleast as bad as some magazines.EGM is possibly the most informative gaming magazine available.Very affordable for a 12 month plan.Some issues have cool stickers or posters and little nice additions.The magazine isn't nerdafied where a non-gamer could pick it up and comprehend it for the most part.Whats nice about EGM is the rating done to each game.Some games that are hyped automatically get good ratings EGM doesn't let the hype get to them they treat it like any other game. The fan art is colorful the screenshots for each game gives you a good idea what to expect from each game.They have little Q areas and issues answered about some games and junk.Upcomming titles are previewed and glorified,so you can almost see the future of gaming.The get the hands on for some upcomming title and even give you the heads up.The reviewers seem in their right groove and not lacking a one sided touch. The price is nice each issue is packed with information,every thing down to the last page is gamer worthy.Buy atleast one issue to help you determin if you like it or not before making a such a commitment 
I am a big fan of British publications such as the Economist and Financial Times because they tend to offer a more balanced and global perspective of the news. The articles here are short and sweet. That is why I was so suprised at how thin the newspaper was when I got my first delivery. This can be a good thing when you are busy, but sometimes I found myself wanting more in-depth coverage. This is where the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) tends to shine. Plus, WSJ has more articles addressing one's lifestyle, i.e, the Personal Journal. Also, the op-ed pieces are undeniably left-leaning but a bit more balanced whereas WSJ tends to be pretty conservative and one-sided. Although I really enjoyed the newspaper, I cancelled my subscription because of the horrible delivery service. One final note, be prepared for the salmon pink color of the newspaper. I know they want to stand apart from other publications, but it makes the newspaper look like it's been stuck in an attic for 10 years and makes it kind of hard to read in low light settings. 
With its over 150 years of experience, the Financial Times is one of the greatest newspapers in the world. Recently rated as the most reliable news source by a survey of journalists, politicians, and other authorities, there are few newspapers that can match its breadth of coverage or depth of analysis. Although it is much lighter than the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, what it does contain is worth its weight in gold. Besides, who can remember everything in the newspaper anyway? Although I would give five stars for this great paper, I have to give four stars because delivery in my area is very bad! Today, I got the Friday edition, when I should be getting the Weekend edition! Getting a newspaper a day late isn't very good, although perhaps it's more the fault of the USPS than the FT 
When I considered subscribing to FT last year, I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't any recent reviews on it. So here we go... I subscribe to both the Wall St Journal and Financial Times (FT), and have in the past subscribed to The Economist. For comparison's sake, the WSJ is very good in its section one coverage, especially front page stories, political coverage, and its excellent and frequently quoted editorials. For me, the other stuff is fluff. Regarding the Economist, it is a highly touted weekly newsmagazine with two downfalls (and reasons why I cancelled my subscription) - it is weekly (!) and seems to interject alot of commentary into its stories. Which leads us to the FT. With FT, I feel like I'm reading THE NEWS, and more importantly, it is in a daily format, ensuring you'll be up to date on the latest global news. There is excellent coverage of US happenings, along with Europe and Asia. Once you read it, you feel much better informed - where else can you get daily extended coverage of the Russian/Ukraine natural gas issue or, from several months ago, daily coverage of Germany's elections? Along with excellent reporting comes great, although somewhat left/liberal commentary - don't let that dissuade you, however. Other gems include business reporting, including stories on management ideas, business life, etc.... and the most excellent Weekend edition (Saturday), full of all sorts of cultural stories, including food, wine, arts, book reviews, travel, and the like. Not too mention awesome columns by Lucy Kellaway, Martin Lukes, and Tyler Brule. You must pick this up and indulge yourself for a few weeks, if you are undecided. You will not be disappointed. Reading and owning the FT is a must. 
This newspaper provides an outside-the-box (US) opinion, even though Britain's outlook is similarities to ours. I read the WSJ daily and the NYTimes when I can, but the WSJ is so conservative and the NYTimes is so liberal that this provides a source that is at least one level removed from the conservative/liberal bias in this country 
I have subscribed to both Alfred Hitchcock and Ellery Queen for years. EQMM is usually a notch better in quality, but AHMM is the avenue for new writers to use more often. As such, the quality of writing is more erratic, but the stories are often more adventurous and the voice a little fresher. Not only that, but AHMM has a monthly contest which is fun and challenging for writers at any level, and a monthly logic puzzle which is always entertaining 
Though mystery novels have never been more popular, we seem to have forgotten the pleasures of the short story. Every month, AHMM offers a satisfying range of stories from noirs to cozies, from contemporaries to historicals, by both established writers and newcomers. This is a great place to spot talent on the way up or to sample the work of writers you don't know (without committing to a novel). Plus, short stories are perfect for the bus or the subway. Once, a wide range of magazines published short fiction in a variety of genres; AHMM is one of the few still upholding that proud tradition 
THIS IS THE MOST AUTHENTIC METAL MAG IN PRINT! NO MUDVAYNE HERE SO FAKERS BEWARE. HAVING BEEN AN EXCESSIVE METAL FAN FOR DECADES NOW, I CAN CREDIT THIS MAGAZINE WITH INTRODUCING ME TO MORE NEW BANDS THAN ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE. nOW WHO ELSE WOULD DO AN INTERVIEW WITH BURZUM, MAIDEN, CARCASS, AUTOPSY AND BLOODBATH IN THE SAME ISSUE ALONGSIDE A SABBATH, DIO, OR EMPEROR PIECE. MM THAT'S WHO. BUY IT OR PISS OFF. HAILS AND HORNS UP TO LIZ CIAVARELLA AND CO 
allright excetp wait and it to start and then get 3 monthly magazines in a wee 
Stories better then nudity Most of the magazines out there are all about nudity. This one is great because it is more about the stimulations of the mind. 
Yeah baby, I am sure that all the letters are in fact absolutely true. I mean who doesn't want to see their wife get laid by 10 large black guys every night? I know that's why I got married 
Penthouse has always been better than playboy when it comes to erotic pictures and stories. This magazine is always full of entertaining stories and letters from readers that are supposed to be fact based exploits,maybe 50/50 in reality. The pictures are very explicit and erotic. Great entertainment for adults only 
I think I have read at least one issue of almost every parenting, family, children, activity, teacher magazine there is... This one is by far the best I've read in a while! From my perspective - a parent of a preemie and an early childhood teacher - it shows childhood to parents in terms/emotions/images they can understand and relate to while conveying what an early childhood teacher/developmentalist/interventionist knows to be true. Way to go Disney! I'm impressed 
I have always avoided parenting magazines: with their crowded covers of life-or-death information, flash-in-the-pan expert pontificating (pacifiers are dangerous! not using pacifiers is dangerous!), buzz-word-loaded headlines, and frantic exclamation points, they are as unappealing to me as the local evening news. The inside of those magazines are just as scattered and hectic as their covers and, as a nanny, the articles themselves, primarily on life as a parent like getting your spouse to help out, sex after kids, how to get your groove back/feel hip, what toys to buy your children next, etc, were not really my niche anyway. And I had a subscription to Martha Stewart Kids for a little while, because I liked the project ideas (though I always adapted them to make them much less involved), but the focus of that magazine has become large, elaborate, professionally catered birthday parties, so I dropped it. Then, I came across Wondertime. While other parenting magazines remind me of parents swapping opinions, advice, and gripes with other parents, this is more like what a child would tell you if he could: for example, what makes a playroom truly functional to a child -an article which begins with a mother realizing her formal dining room is a waste of space and which I wish I could give to every family I've ever worked with. The article "come play with me" in the summer 2006 issue begins "Does being a grown-up mean you've outgrown child's play? C'mon, you know you have it in you. Here are some playful ideas for outing your inner child." And it actually is a perspective on how to enjoy it -not tips on how to cope with the fact that you find it mind-numbingly boring or must endure it as necessary "quality time." The article "a broom of one's own" talks about how much children love being included, in helping, in doing something themselves. Toys mentioned in here are things like mirrors, sand, water, and the great outdoors (and in that sense the advertisements in here seem really out of place).  I also deeply appreciate the magazine's attitude towards children and learning. In other magazines, there is an abundance of advice on how to ensure you are stimulating your children as much as possible, how to manipulate their play and exploration, how to make everything into a language game, everything into a quiz, everything into the kind of lesson in which the adult is in charge of the show and puts the child through his paces. This magazine, at least for now, takes the approach that Learning Happens. Allow it to happen and allow yourself to enjoy being around it. I love that. I can't wait to see the third issue 
The title of this magazine caught my eye on the newstand - and I'm glad I bought the first issue! As a first time, new mom there were many articles that inspired and encouraged me. If you want to learn to journey with your children as they wonder about the world around them while understanding how they develop and teaching them, give this magazine a try! The first issue discussed everything from setting up a play room so children can explore safely and be responsible for their stuff to tree climbing and nature walks, as well as advice on first time pet ownership for preschooler and learning to tell time. I am planning on subscribing and can't wait to see what comes next! Wondertime is a delightful departure from the typical parenting magazine that has articles about how to get your child to do what you want them to do, or cause you to worry that you will destroy your childs future forever unless you buy them this or that new product. Instead, you will learn how your child is growing, how you can teach them more about things they are interested in and ideas for exploring the world together. It is uplifting, encouraging, values wonder, exploration, nature and children aws well as the special relationship between them and their parents. 
I've been a subscriber to Body + Soul magazine for about a year now, and I look forward to each new issue. The magazine focuses on many areas of interest to me, including healthy eating, holistic health, fitness, and personal growth. The articles frequently feature practical things like recipes, buying guides, yoga or other fitness instructions, and emotional exercises (the latter of which I find particularly helpful in my work as a psychologist). My only complaints about this magazine is that there is a bit too much of a focus on spiritual/meditation type issues, which are less relevant to me, and that the magazine is on the short side with a high number of advertisements. Otherwise, I definitely enjoy Body + Soul and do plan to renew my subscription. 
"Following our dreams is about setting an intention, taking the necessary steps to bring it to life, and then letting the force of serendipity take over." ~Alanna Fincke, Editor Marianne Williamson once said: "You can let the same force that makes flowers grow and planets move run your life, or you can do it yourself." With that in mind, I read Body + Soul to awaken the side of me that allows for such healing contemplations. Articles about living your dreams and the small-farm comeback give me hope for the future. The recent article about Beauty by the Sea is pure fun with ideas for sand scrubs, meditation while waves kiss your legs and nourishing hair treatments. They also give a list of "inspiring beach reads." Having trouble sleeping? This magazine always has ideas for how you can become healthier and presents ideas and products that unlock secrets of health. A sample of July/August 2006 contents include: Whole Living - Recipes for green tea ice cream Rejuvenate - Herb baths for cooling the skin in summer Going Natural - Meditation Eat Well - Teas made with herbs like peppermint Conscious Eating - Breaking bad habits Healthy Home - Selecting the best pillow Whole Health - Healing for asthma and learning to love the body you have Inner Growth - Identifying spiritual road blocks and finding instant calm I love their idea about an "action plan." This section gives ideas for how to make a difference in your life with the ideas in this magazine. If you have an interest in organic produce, yoga, healthy herbal supplements or anything natural and nurturing, you might love this magazine. ~The Rebecca Review 
The mag is truly great. I love curling up with some tea or relaxing in the tub while I read it. It has great tip for a balanced life with focus on stress reduction, eating right, and keeping fit. There is a homeopathic medicinal side to the mag, but it is balanced by science based artilces. Great mag. Highly recommended if you like to live a balanced life. Also has great artilces about people dealing with issues we all deal with and inspirational thoughts. 
This isn't a magazine that's preachy or tries to tell you that the western way of life is bad. It simply offers multiple ways of looking at things, whether it's fitness, food, spirituality, or something else. I appreciate the open-minded way Body Soul seems to approach its articles. I tend to dog-ear the interesting pages in my magazines, and with this one I always seem to dog-ear almost every other page! The other thing I appreciate about this magazine is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Just goes to show you can be slightly irreverent and still get an intelligent point across. Kudos to Body Soul! (p.s. You can't even tell it's a Martha magazine -- I didn't realize it until I saw the other reviews on this page, who apparently thought it was going to be another MTL or something 
I have gone through my latest copy twice of this magazine. The interesting articles and letters make you feel like you are part of a community, not just a crazy cat person. I like the extensive breeder listing in the back, whether or not I ever will get a pure bred cat. 
Reminded me that the subscription was up for renewal, I renewed it, and that was it 
This is a great magazine for cat lovers even if you don't have a cat. It talks about care tips as well as stories about other cats 
I enjoy reading the articles and stories in the Cat Fancy magazine. Being a new cat owner, and not very "cat smart," I have found that I have learned a lot of valuable infomation reading this magazine each month. Each month they introduce different items available for cats, such as grooming aids, comfort products and new fun toys. Buying the magazine through Amazon.com is a big savings over buying it through the magazine itself 
One of the better weekly magazines that covers world affairs from what's on the news around the world to some pretty obscure things like Imelda Marcos' shoes to life in China, a society not at ease with the globalisation of the world. TIME did a really good article on how Google has allowed itself to be sensored in the name of finance, makes you realise that Human Rights don't exsist when the dollar signs are being totted up! The UK edition pretty much follows the USA edition, it's an easy read, and what's good is that every now and again TIME puts out a special edition which often follows a theme, the last one was on Christopher Columbus. Worth getting a subscription, also you can do what I do, when you've read a copy, give it to your local dentist or Doctor for their waiting room 
My "Time" magazine arrives like clockwork weekly in my mailbox. I am always happy to see it there among the bills and the junk mail. I recently dropped cable TV, and "Time" fills in all the gaps for me, and gives in depth reports on newsworthy events that are just glossed over on the local stations. From the big world events, including special reports like the recent Tsunami tragedy, to what's new in the science and industry world, the economy, the latest inventions and gadgets, to sports and people in the news, and TV, movie and music happenings, there is something for everbody. It's a periodical that lets me catch up on the newest terminology in the cyber world to the newest star in the hip-hop world. It amazes my kids that I would even know this. The articles seem well researched, are well written, interesting and very informative. Find out if the video game your child is playing is suitable for their age group, who we lost this week, great quotes and much more. There are excellent photos and even the letters to the editor seem more insightful and informative then anywhere else. From Politics to Fitness, from Food to Technology..it's all here. The price is right for a subscription. You get your money's worth, and will have the world at your fingertips. Keep up the pace with "Time"....Laurie 
Great magazine couldn't recommend it any higher for anyone starting out with macs. iCreate also introduced a great Pro section in 2005 to delveinto the workings of ProApps such as Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, mDVD Studio Pro etc. Now here's the thing, I'm wondering how the magazine can be available for subscription while the magazine was put on hold late last year. Me, or anyone I know with a subscription haven't recieved the mag for months, and there has been no contact from the people who handle the subscription despite zillions of e-mails. So be careful, get the full story before you hand over any money!!!!!!!!!!! check the web for similar storries, you will find the 
You bet, this one is. There are only a few Mac oriented magazines out there and they all wish they could be this well written. This is a large format magazine and each issue is filled with a series of how-to articles that I consider the best written, best illustrated and easiest to follow. I can slog through some fairly dull reading but this is the magazine I would give to my wife / daughter / co-worker to explain how to use iChat, hook up an iSight camera, customize iCal, get started with Safari and so on. They review many new software tittles and the latest hardware goodies. Since it is a magazine, the reviews are very current. Each issue comes with a CD and they are starting to include pdf copies of prior issues, great for reference 
I started reading iCreate with the very first issue and haven't stopped yet. I had recently purchased an iBook for my sister in an effort to bring her into the 21st century but for all of the ease the Mac offers, my sister still wasn't really doing anything but using email...and even then maybe once a week. I picked up a copy of iCreate for her when it first came out. I liked it because it was written in plain english and it seemed that every page was a tutorial. Well it is 11 issues later and I am still hooked on this magazine. My sister has her own web page and is a master if the iLife program..all thanks to iCreate magazine. I read it too,,,love the disc and the articles. I find that it is better than Mac Addict (which hurts to say) and some of the other Mac mags. This magazine is geared towards the beginner to intermediate user but I'll tell you...even experianced users will enjoy it 
I picked up a copy at a local book store strictly for the article on networking and found a lot more useful items included. If you're into Macs for using the iLife and similar software, there are a ton of good "tutorials" included in each issue. Newstand price was $15.50, so it's more on the order of buying a paperback book instead of a magazine. Content is excellent--I found things in the tutorials that even the local Apple store didn't give in their classes 
As an interior design student, I find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration, variety, and creativity. This magazine is more about art and design than advice on "do it yourself" decorating or cheap furniture finds, so: do NOT subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one-two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different, more practical purpose 
I was very surprised by the reviews below because I found this magazine absolutely wonderful!! The articles range from architecture, to renovated homes, to specific garden types to the average home owner. I found so many great ideas and inspiration in this magazine as well. The pictures are great and I find myself tearing things out every month! Fantastic for anyone interested in design, art, or interior decorating 
Alternative Medicine does a terrific job of explaining the benefits and uses of complementary (alternative) therapies -- which have been used for centuries, throughout the world. The articles are thoroughly researched and unbiased. You'll learn how to build your body's resistance against cancers, allergies, and auto-immune diseases - and what the true causes of these illnesses are. It also provides very helpful information for parents regarding their children's health, including autism and other learning disabilities. It also includes interviews and biographies on homeopaths and other complementary medical practitioners and the successes they have had with their patients. It's truly a practical guide for anyone open to exploring how to get healthier and stay that way without toxic side effects. You'll learn something new in every issue - I know I do 
I LOVE THIS MAGAZINE! IT HAS UP TO THE MINUTE, NEED TO KNOW CELEB NEWS. HONESTLY MOST OF THE TIME WHAT THEY SAY IN THESE "TABLOID" MAGAZINES TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE- JESSICA SIMPSON SPLIT, AND BRAD AND ANGELINA, JEN AND VINCE, JUST TO NAME A FEW....ALSO THERE'S MOVIE/DVD/MUSIC REVIEWS, MAKEUP AND FASHION TIPS, AND THE CLOTHES THEY HAVE IN THERE ARE AFFORDABLE SO YOU CAN DRESS LIKE YOUR FAVORITE CELEB. I LOOK FORWARD TO EACH WEEK GETTING THIS MAGAZINE 
This is the best of the best of the rags out there. Reader beware: not everything you read is the truth. I love to thumb through this magazine from cover to cover and can't wait to receive it in the mail each week. The pictures are fun to look at and it's simple, mindless reading! From the newest styles that the stars are wearing to the latest make-up craze and new fangeled products out there, this magazine will give it all to you. Not to mention who's doing what and with whom in Tinseltown! So... get your own subscription today! Note: you save almost .50 off the cover price at the stores 
I have been a faithful Star reader for the past few years and sometimes their stories are right on the money. Now that Star is glossy, they really try to give Us Weekly a run for their money. I love the new glossy star, but don't like the higher price tag, so if you can afford a subscription it's worth it. They tend to cover the usual suspects as far as celebrities, and rarely do they cover human interests stories that don't have to deal with tinseltown, but if you want to read about -Kirstie Alley, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, The Olsen Twins, and the usual suspects you will enjoy this mag 
EVERYONE NEEDS A LITTLE FUN AND THIS MAGAZINE DELIVERS EVEN IF THE STORIES AREN'T ALWAYS TRUE IT'S FUN TO READ AND ISN'T TO HEAVY TO DIGEST. GREAT PHOTOS AND GOSSIP. I LOVE THE FASHION PAGES AND THE WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!! PHOTO' 
I love to look at the vibrant and diverse layouts and search for ideas to incorporate into my own pages! Almost every page has at least one layout or technique (including the advertisement layouts). I find that I get more ideas from these magazines than I do from how-to booklets, etc. There is a great section every month where several people use the same supplies to see how many different looks can be achieved. They give a glimpse of brand new products in the trade as well as give practical ideas for the budget conscious 
This magazine is great. My daughter and I are doing projects together out of it every issue. It's great also because it is training us to be creative on our own, and to try new things. We also do these singing lesson Cds together- "Voice Lessons To Go" by Vaccarino- really fun, and have been doing Berlitz beginning Spanish Cds together. We love choices beyond sitting and watching TV 
Time Out New York is a trendy, hip, and fun weekly guide to New York City. It covers weekly events and reviews for just about everything including; eating out, parks, dance, theatre, bars clubs, sales store openings, museums, art, Gay Lesbian, book readings, live music, and much more. The magazine also features interesting facts, profiles, interviews in each weekly issue. I think its great whether you are new to the city or a veteran. This is the PERFECT GIFT for any recent graduates moving to NYC 
I bought it as a gift. The person I got it for, likes it 
I first learned about Time Out while living in London. The London edition of this magazine became my constant companion, allowing me to find great events. Now living just outside of NYC, TONY was my first magazine subscription at my new apartment. Offers many free events, as well as its usual picky reviews. Great for a one-resource list of the week's events 
This magazine does a great job of featuring good articles at the beginning and then breaking down events you might want to do in New York City that week. The magazine is organized into various categories that are color coded so that when you get it, you can just skip to the section you're interested in. There's a whole city out there to discover and TONY can help point you in the right direction 
Time Out New York, or TONY, has it all. Every little thing that's going down in New York is covered. More importantly, you can actually locate salient information without having to wade through 20 pages of transgender massage ads as in the Village Voice 
If you are looking for information about Ferrari automobiles, this magazine is definitely one of the best ones around. Each issue is packed with detailed information on new models, older models, special editions, etc. in addition to racing information, serial number histories, etc. You will also find a wide range of incredible pictures. Highly recommend this to anyone who has any interest in Ferrari! 
US Weekly used to be a cross between People and The National Enquirer - ever since the new editor has stepped in (it seems that they have a new one every year) the magazine has been revamped. It looks more like the classy People and less like a trash tabloid. I'm also a little skeptical about those who complain Amazon.com doesn't deliver their magazines. Not every business is perfect, but I haven't had a problem having my magazines delivered when I've ordered them from Amazon.com. It just makes me think that all the people that are whining are just taking out their frustrations on life at Amazon.com. Maybe its why we see so many vicious and jealous reviews, if you don't like your life change it. Don't complain about it, that's how most people get where they are today. Anyway, unlike People, US Weekly mainly focuses on celebrities and I think that for its price its far too short. At least People is thick. Anyhow, for the celebrity junkie, US Weekly is a must read. Like another reviewer, I too am tired of reading about Jessica Simpson and Brangelina. I think the celebrity magazines are tired of this as well. I'm starting to see a more diverse focus of celebrities on the magazines. Its certainly much better than reading In touch and Life Style Weekly. Although I do like US Weekly, I still think that People is the best. People is more classy, has a great layout, their focus is 50/50 on celebrities and articles on average folks. They have great photos and other interesting reads on their magazine. Even their website is great, US Weekly's website looks like a barbie website. The recent changes have been great but if US Weekly really wants to compete with People then it needs to step up to the plate more. Despite its faults, US Weekly is a luscious read and worth all of its frothiness, so enjoy it. 
I am a huge Nelson fan and thought I was the only one left; until I visited their website www.thenelsonbrothers.com. They are as hot as ever! Since "After the Rain" they have released six more Cd's. I highly recommend the "Brother Harmony" Cd, or the "Like Father Like Sons" Cd, where they honor their late great father, Rick Nelson, by bringing back his music. They are currently available to come to your hometown and put on a performance that will leave you wanting more. To contact information on booking them for your area, please contact them at www.nelsontourinfo.com. Hey ... it's an awesome experience to see them in action. Sincerely, Kay Javen 
What I love most about this travel magazine is the out-of-the-ordinary information it provides within a particular destination. Although primarily geared towards $$$$$+ destinations, the editors do a great job with providing more than just great hotel info. In the September 2006 edition, there is the 12 th annual Green List which details the best places in ecotourism - preserving earth's environment and cultures while traveling to the destinations that are simultaneously earth and people friendly. It happens to be a great magazine, well researched, well written, and informative while delivering unique information. 
Conde Nast Traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want-a-bees. The magazine is geared mostly to North America and Europe. It tells where to eat, shop or be seen on the two continents. For example, an article will inform the reader of a new five-star Sushi restaurant in Florence, Italy. Thus, if you plan to travel to Florence for Sushi (not Michelangelo), this is the magazine for you. It is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler, for the pictures are gorgeous. 
this is a great travel magazine - wonderful pictures and stories. it is also much cheaper than the equally wonderful travel+leisure, so that makes conde nast traveler a better deal. be aware though, the items in this magazine are not very cheap, unfortunately. go with another magazine (arthur frommer's budget travel) if you want to find travel baragains 
Even though there seem to be hundreds of different digital photography magazines on the newsstand every month, Digital Photo Pro is pretty much the only one that I buy. I don't buy every issue, but seeing as I end up buying about 80% of the issues, I should probably get a subscription! I like Digital Photo Pro because it actually contains new and useful information. "New" because it's information that I haven't read in another magazine or on the web, and "useful" because the information is targeted at readers with a solid understanding of the basics of digital photography. I find that most other digital photography magazines are targeted at newbies, and they take turns repeating the same information (like the endless articles about the different ways to convert a colour image to black white). Many of the contributors to Digital Photo Pro are well-known names in the digital imaging field, so the information is generally current and practical, with excellent photos to illustrate the articles. Recommended 
After having subscribed to Peterson's Photographic for several years, I'm now hooked on this new magazine and am going to let the old subscription lapse. I've gotten tired of all the articles targeted at beginners. Digital Photo Pro digs into the meat of photography a little deeper. Some examples of articles which I've enjoyed are discussions of how digial imaging sensors work and how ink jet printers work. In the most recent issue is a good article on using the unsharp mask in Photoshop. Also, I've enjoyed the large section on new products in each issue. One caveat is that there is some nudity. You may or may not find this objectionable (my wife is in the former category :). Also, there is usually an article on glamour photography or glamour photographers in each issue. Even if this isn't your cup of tea, there is still good stuff to learn in those articles. The magazine is beautifully published with very high quality paper and printing. It's also nice and big. www.jpwphoto.co 
Wifey and I are always so excited when the new Dwell arrives in the mail. This is the cutting edge of architecture and design magazines, and we are always looking for new ideas and trends in its many colorful and well-photographed pages. A truly great monthly mailer 
I picked up a copy of Dwell in my brother's mod condo he owns and thought, oh, not another boring Design magazine. WOW. I was really impressed with both the great pictures and the range of topics in this little gem. From "chairs through the ages" to a complete timeline of modern design (toasters to iPods!) I just couldn't stop saying "ahhhh"! Since this magazine is not available in many places (such as the supermarket), it's well worth a subscription. There are wonderful ideas for small spaces but also for larger homes too. It would make a great gift for a 20 something that is just getting into their first space. (and hey, having it on your coffee table makes your hipness go up by about 100%~!) 
Question: Is there a better American English-language daily anywhere? Answer: no. The Times (of London) is a great and venerable paper, but not easily available in the US and focused on a different reality. The New York Times is an institution in its own right, better than WSJ on foreign affairs, and much more complete paper. But the Wall Street Journal is as good as it gets for a daily newspaper reader in this country with a business bent, an appreciation for an unfailingly high standard of writing and editing, and no particular interest in 'soft' topics or the New York cultural scene. This is one very crisp paper. The last time an article got to wordy was back in 1967 and that writer's body was never found. Just kidding. But it would be a convenient myth for explaining WSJ's disciplined tone. In the 'Personal Journal' section, I routinely find articles that reshape some aspect of my personal (usually financial) life and habits. Sports news is heady and analytical. For example, as I write this review we are in the thick of the American and National League Championship Series. Today's reportage does not tell me who won and lost last night and why. Instead, the 'On Sports' column is called 'Base Instincts' and explains why so many third base coaches end up as managers. In short, apart from the players they are the most important guy on the fold. Across the page, the 'By the Numbers' column is called 'Praising Pitcher's Parks'. It asks why temas that play in pitcher-friendly parks do so well in October. As of this moment, I still don't know who won last night. But I know a lot more about the game of baseball. Best of all, you can generally avoid the pricey subscription if you're willing to use frequent flyer miles to subscribe. One memorably off-kilter film moment had its protagonist emerging from his tent and declaiming, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.' 'Never smelled napalm and don't hanker after the carnage. But I can say that the sight of my Journal in the driveway every morning in its little blue bag is an oddly comforting experience. Buy it 
Excellent (detailed, timely, and unbiased) source of business information; editorial page, however, is strongly slanted towards the conservative side 
'The Wall Street Journal' it seems to me has the most sane and persuasive political writing of any major daily American paper. Its editorial writers are outstanding, and provide generally great insight into world news. I read I must admit this paper occasionally and selectively, searching out the pieces that most interest me. I am simply not the person who really follows closely the business and economic news the WSJ provides. One small criticism is that I have never liked the format of the paper. I just do not like the way those very thin columns look. But this is of course usually more than made up for by the quality of their content 
I read the WSJ, Financial Times and NY Times on a regular basis. The reporting in the WSJ is great -- well researched, comprehensive presentation of facts, broad coverage of issues of the day. The articles in the WSJ make painfully apparent the shortcomings of other media outlets in the U.S. that are content to present competing spin. I trust information found in WSJ articles in a way that I would never trust the pathetic presentation that passes for reporting at the NY Times. The only negative of the WSJ is its editorial page. I am a big believer in capitalism and free markets (I own my own business) but I abhor the nasty editorial page that consistently sells out the true believers to push a crony capitalist agenda. For opinion I look to the Financial Times and the Economist 
This newspaper is far superior to TV news. It does articles in depth and has nuggets of amazing news stories that you will not find anywhere else. It is a window on the world of news, business, finance, medicine, science, travel and politics. In addition to the print version, WSJ also offers an internet version 
"The Wall Street Journal" is nothing less than America's true newspaper of record, a window on the world of business, finance, international affairs, and all the delicious little nuggets of news that would otherwise slip through the cracks. I am a media carnivore: I am news-addicted. I get my news in hourly, massive slabs: from CNBC, from CNN, from the Internet---and best of all, in the brain-shatteringly early hours of the morning in the form of my daily Wall Street Journal (kudos goes, as well, to my unfailingly faithful early-rising Journal deliveryman). With that high praise I also must dispatch a warning to the curious: if you subscribe to the Journal---and if you want to be informed and ahead of the game, then you must!---you'll discover, possibly for the first time, intense agonies of Guilt. The Journal is, every single day, chock full of so many juicy, delicious, insanely informative, amazingly well-written, positively balanced nuggets of journalism on finance, politics, economics, technology, market trends, literary explosions---so much, in fact, that it's an embarrassment of riches. If you're busy---and who isn't?---then you simply won't have time to read everything. Like Caesar's Roman Gaul, The Wall Street Journal is also divided into three parts: the Front page, Marketplace, and Money Investing. Page One is my beachhead in the morning: I scan the middle two columns for the financial and geopolitical earth movers---and if I have the time, I can dig into the paper for all the gory details. The news here is uniformly objective: opinion is cut out, the wounds cauterized, and the unbiased opinion itself served up piping hot on the Journal's editorial page. Marketplace deals with macro and micro business trends, and is always engagingly written. Sometimes the supplement "Personal Journal" accompies the fleet out; more often than not, there's another tasty little section dealing with mutual funds, technology trends, industry strategies, and quite a bit more. It's a veritable treasure-house of knowledge, and since Gordon Gekko was right---the most valuable commodity in the world is information---the Wall Street Journal serves as purveyor of that most critical, that most precious commodity. And, I might add, serves it up with spice, brains, guts and panache. Oh, and Money Investing is a fly-by of all the major financial trends of the day: M, economics, currency, commodities, oil making investors shake and quake, big stock movers. All good stuff. Finally---and I'm biased, be warned---the Editorial Page is the best on the planet, and I always scour it at lunch---always. If you want to be informed---if you want to be light years ahead of your arch-rival, that nasty VP of Finance Hastings down the hall, which naturally you do---you should at the very least read the Editorial Page. It is incisive, delicious, never boring, brimming with opinion and intelligence. Yum. The Journal is with me in the nosebleed hours of the early morning, right beside my boiled eggs and toast and steaming cup(s) of coffee. And it's with me in the evening, when I actually get to dip into it, at leisure, with my cigar and scotch. So subscribe to it, I say: The Wall Street Journal is an important, glorious, massively influential American institution. It's your window on the World of affairs. It's what the movers and shakers of the British Empire might have read had the Empire survived into the 21st century: and yes, you have the news of the world, at your fingertips, hauled back from the Journal's far-flung outposts across the globe: from Hong Kong, London, Kuala Lumphur. Sincere Kudos to the Journal's officer corps: Karen Elliott House, the Publisher; Paul Steiger, Managing Editor; and Paul Gigot, Editorial Page Editor---and the brilliant, dedicated, blindingly talented team of reporters that work with them. Bravo! For a decade now, not a morning has dawned without my Journal: it is my polestar and compass. It makes me richer, which makes me happier. It is a tasty read. Stop gawking and subscribe. 
magazine arrived approx 10 weeks after ordering - that was Ok - just need to spell that out in original order - my daughter kept looking for the magazine... 
I am still a college students with no children. I got this magazine because I absolutly love children. A while back one of the readers suggested taking peices you think will be important and putting them in a scrapbook based on the age of your unborn baby. I LOVE this idea and this magazine is the perfect one to do this with 
My wife and I have found this magazine to be both entertaining and educational. It always helps to see what other parents have done in certain situations to better prepare you for yours. The articles provide some wonderful information that is useful in everyday life. We would recommend this to all new parents 
I really look forward to receiving this every month. I am blown away by all their crafty ideas for art projects, organization, and meals. Really fun 
I just ordered my own subscription to Parents Magazine because I was reading it over at my younger mother-in-laws all the time and I absolutely LOVE it. I even ordered the Sleep Sheep I saw in there. The thing people need to remember is that it is aimed at mothers aged 18-34. There are other magazines out there for older mothers that I'm sure us younger ones would find uninformative and biased. Every magazine has a demographic goal. I honestly LOVE this magazine. I'm 24, and a stay-at-home mom and my husband works at an electronics store. We are by no means upper class. But I still find their tips on saving money and bargain buying VERY helpful. For those who are older, you might want to try babycenter.com for tips for older mothers. 
I was given a subscription to this magazine during my pregnancy and have gaining a lot of knowledge on the baby world from it. I enjoy the read and have picked up a lot of great ideas from it 
I started receiving Parents while I was pregnant and I will be renewing my subscription soon. Parents is a great magazine for new or experienced parents. It is a wealth of information and advice about raising kids young and old. Great magazine! 
I HAVE BEEN RECEIVING PARENTS FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. EVERY MONTH I LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE NEW EDITION OF PARENTS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF USEFUL TIPS AND THE EMERGENCY GUIDES ARE VERY INFORMATIVE. I ALSO LOVE THE YEARLY INFO ON EVERYDAY TOPICS FOR EACH AGE GROUP. OKAY I DO FIND A LOT OF ADDS BUT I HAVE SEEN WORSE. I SUSCRIBE TO CHILD,PARENT, PARENTING, BABY TALK. BABY TALK AND PARENT ARE SOME OF THE BEST OUT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Beautiful magazine! Excellent articles and lovely pictures. I really enjoyed reading about the Bronte sisters' home in the last issue. 
This reaqder is a true Anglophile and wants this new,year old magazine to survive. Judging from the amount of advertizing it receives, I'm not sure that it will. Each edition brings decorating features, some English recipies, homes for sale, and descriptions of all manner of things English. Written for North American readers, it is a delight 
great pictures so good looking,i having been getting it for 20 years ,great price. i wish these boys could say at my house in Palm Springs,Ca. for a month or longer, they could be house boys. 1-760-288-7545 anytime 
FRESHMEN is a magazine for those who like their men on the youngish side. It possesses the same quality as MEN magazine, but not quite the husky nature of that publication 
If you like young, taut, masculine flesh displayed at its most inviting, you'll love this magazine. Supple, nubile youths (over 18 of course) parade their wares, front and back, and look longingly into the camera. Consistently fine photography makes this magazine first choice for those with a taste for the younger gents.. 
Harp is the best music magazine out there. The writing is top notch and I love the photography and design. I have spent more money than I care to mention on cd's I've read about in Harp and have NEVER been disapointed. I highly recommend this magazine to anyone who is as obsessed about music as me 
SOME ARTICLES ARE OUT DATED.. WHY IRAQ APPEARS IN EVERY ISSUE... SO BORIN 
I have been subscribing to this magazine for years, and it is a very special part of my weekly regimen. In fact, every Monday or Tuesday I start to feel a pang of something being 'missing' if I haven't yet read that week's issue. As I explained to my daughter this summer, I do not read every word, every page, or every article. But I do flip through every page and read whatever interests me or catches my attention. Alot of it is just to look at the pictures and read the captions. Every issue usually contains at least a few articles that I read in their entirety -- usually in the business and lifestyle sections -- and I often pick up tips on good books, music, and movies from it. A very solid subscription. A way of life, actually 
This magazine is an easy read that keeps me generally informed with what's going on. Unlike the dry indepth articles of the Economist, Time Magazine is quick bang bang information. -a good overview. 
I personally have always enjoyed reading Time magazine long before I became politically aware. I started reading this magazine since I was in my adolescence.Do I think it is liberal biased as some of the other reviewers claims that it is? I don't know and I don't care. I don't read it from a particular point of view. Some of the cover stories in the past may be highly questionable given how shallow they might be but I don't take it personally. One of the best articles I have read in a long time is the issue on high school drop outs. I thought that was quite thought provoking. I didn't think much of the 100 most influential people in the world list. Katie Couric?! C'mon. That woman is to hard journalism as Paris Hilton is to music. I won't even get into Rachel Ray. If people think Time Magazine is too liberal, then go read the National Review. I don't see Time as hard journalism. Half the stuff they publish is fluff pieces. 
Great magazine. Keeps NYers informed of what's going on in the city and has a great crossword puzzle, to boot 
New York magazine is the flag bearer for "New York is the Center of the Universe" belief. It meets this goal in dishing up news, gossip, reviews and viewpoints on a weekly basis. (How else can one get away with call shopping Strategy?) The magazine succeeds because behind the snobbery (example: An article on the 2nd best cities in the world) it turns up the restaurants, stories and culture that make NYC such a fantabulous place. It's worth diminishes rapidly, though, the further one gets from the Big Apple 
Well written, highly informative and with a recent redesign one of the best looking city magazines I've seen. Always interesting lead articles and great food reviews (better than the main competition Time Out). Only real quibbles are that their event listings aren't as comprehensive as Time Out, but there is so much better writing here that it doesn't really compare. 
I love this magazine. have subscribed since it started and I always loved it's sexy women (cuz i'm one ;) hilarious and satyr filled articles and it's no-nonsense attitude. I agree with another reviewer that there is a definite diffrence as of late but until it gets real horrible i'll keep on reading 
Okay so the pictures of the girls are not my thing but where else can you read a fresh look about cars, eating healthy and fashion? Ladies, this is a must read in order to talk to men! It features fun topics sure to entertain and assist in carrying conversation with all the guys 
This is by far the best photo magazine I have seen in my 40 years of being a photographer.(and I subscribe to half a dozen). The reproduction is superb, and it offers a variety of genres without getting into the freaky stuff like Aperture sometimes does. I have saved every issue I have received as if a book 
I was on vacation in Miami last December and picked-up a copy of this magazine-BW.It is the best photographic magazine I have ever seen or read.It is the best tribute to black and white photography as an art form. The prinitng quality is equally as superb and highly compliments the new technology in printing.It gives new meaning to the words photo finish. Unfortunately the magazine is only avaliable in the United States so I have had to subscribe using my son's address in Miami. It has inspired me to further improve my work as an artist,photographer, who considers black and white photography as the only true art form and dismisses digital photography as not being photography.

If your are interested in travel, culture, dining, society, or photography, this is absolutely the magazine for you. Each issue is chock full of travel ideas that go above and beyond the boring tourist traps, and digs deep into a destinations culture and individuality. Also, giving you vivid photographic illustrations that the National Geographic Society is world renowned for 
Unlike other travel magazines, this one provides a lot of useful information while holding advertising to a minimum and not interlarding promos throughout the articles (Rick Steves, are you listening?). Each issue contains a wide variety of material about diferent parts of the world and the information provided for featured destinations is truly useful. In other words, the information is trustworthy, the first prerequisite for a travel magazine. Production quality is excellent; this is a magazine you will leave out on your coffee table. Surprisingly, the website stinks. Not even subscribers are able to access many of the articles on line, and the weekly A-List of special deals is unimaginative and seems to focus on useless extravagances (lots of spa get-a-ways) 
National Geographic Traveler brings content rich information about the locations covered, the culture of the people, places to stay for many budgets, along with breathtaking photography that makes me want to leap right into the pages. National Geographic also has excellent travel packages (I prefer land, no cruises for me) to destinations rich in archeology, history, ancient culture, as well as newer destinations with respect to where to stay. If you love seeing the beauty of our planet, this great magazine will definitely help you make your decisions a lot easier!

I love this magazine great travel ideas, and fun to read even if you never make the trip! A recent issue on the Yucatan really helped make our vacation there so much more interesting. We visted ruin sites we would have never seen other wise. This magazine and "Tourist in the Yucatan" (Thriller/adventure) really made my vacation special 
Aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine, and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout. Although ostensively devoted to art photography, many of the spreads are essentially photojournalism. If you are primarily interested in just art photography, and can subscribe only to one magazine, I would suggest "Blind Spot" 
Aperture has one of the most outstanding reputations for bringing its readers the best in artistic photography. I own several editions of the publication which are put up in areas where they will be kept cool and dry because the magazine is so highly collectible. Some editions on auction have netted hundreds of dollars. And Aperture covers a wide array of subjects, from mailboxes out on country roads, to architecture, from rare plants, to bizarre special effects, Aperture brings you photography you'll want to look at again and again and again. You'll get photographs from some of the world's most renowned photographers, and you'll get them on pages so pristine, you'd think you were viewing them at a gallery. If you want a magazine that gives you "The All" in photography, Aperture has it. Oh, and one more note, from time to time Aperture offers its customers the opportunity to purchase rare collectibles, many of which are autographed by the photographers 
Aperture mixes interesting pictures, that are satisfying to the eye with more mainstream pictures that would appeal to all categories of photographers. Aperture is for those who do not like there pictures characteristic of so called "normal family pictures" These pictures are amazing... Aperture magazine is amazing...If you are thinking that it is not worth the price, think again because Aperture will definantly have you taking and seeing your pictures in a whole new light 
This newsletter is a great resource for dog people. The articles are well researched, detailed, and best of all, applicable. I keep them in a binder, and often refer back to earlier issues if I have a health or training concern about my dogs (and have been known to share them with friends.) Both the positive training and the holisitic health information is great. I definitely recommend this newsletter to anyone who loves their dogs. 
The Whole Dog Journal should be mandatory for anyone that loves their dog. The information found in this magazine is the best I have ever seen regarding the health and happiness of any dog. The editor and contributing writers are the best in the dog world. They tell the whole truth about dogs that you will not find anywhere. And this information can and has been lifesaving. You will not find better information anywhere 
This is a great publication for the person who takes their dogs health and well being seriously. Each month I look forward to receiving my Journal. I breed shih tzu puppies and this journal has answered many questions that have come up. All new dog owners would appreciate this as a gift. 
I used to read Dog Fancy, which is a great magazine also. However, I'm more interested in dog general health and wellness than seeing articles on specific breeds and at least half the magazine is advertising. Our 2 kids are mutts. I started reading the articles of which one was on the best dry dog food. Not seeing my brand was very eye opening. Another on supplements for older dogs verified what I had already been doing for years. I use natural remedies on our dogs whenever possible. I've now read through 4 issues and love the magazine. A recent article describes vaccinations and what issues to consider in determining whether your dog REALLY needs a particular one. There are definitely those that are necessary (like rabies) and others that depend on the area you live in. After reading it, it cleared up a few questions for me. I think of this magazine as a 'Consumer Reports' for dogs, since there's no advertising in it either. There are product reviews and they're very well written, tell you a product's features as well as cost, the pros and cons. The magazine's website also allows you to read the issue online and you can download it to your desktop. My family and I are definitely sold on the magazines. We give it 2 paws up! 
This is not your father's business magazine. Picked it up for the first time in a doctor's office and stole the issue (on real estate) 
If you're going to publish a business magazine, then you should publish articles that are useful to people in business. Business 2.0 does this, but only with every second or so issue. In between, they publish a lot of vapid, unfocused material that is unworthy of publication anywhere. The good articles are worth enough to me that I'll continue to subscribe, but I wish they'd get their act together 
Business 2.0 is one of the few business magazines I read on a monthly basis, and just recently extended for another 2 years. One of the most valuable aspects of this magazine is their analysis of the bleeding edge companies - I don't want to limit my reading to case studies and best practices from the biggest, most obviously successful companies. I want to know what the startups are doing, and what the oddball companies with new ideas are doing differently. Not everything is going to apply, but since your own business must constantly evolve, I like a magazine that focuses on the constant changes of a variety of businesses. Why four stars? To be honest, when the magazine was purchased by its current parent company a couple years back, I feel the quality took a bit of a hit. I don't care for the new design, though I'm sure it saved a few dollars. And the number/quality of articles also slid a bit. But all in all its still one of the better business magazines out there, and by far the best in the "new economy" sector 
A few weeks ago, I started building my first PC from scratch and have found Computer Shopper magazine the best resource. The reviews and articles really helped me decide what parts to use, and the recent "how to" guide on assembling a PC was a godsend. I don't think there's another magazine out there that provides such in-depth advice -- their writers really know what they're talking about! Plus, if I can't find what I'm looking for in the magazine itself, Computer Shopper's Web Buyer directs me to the sites where I can find what I need -- both technical help and the cheapest parts. I can't thank them enough for saving me all that time I would have spent surfing the Internet myself. I'd definitely recommend that anyone interested in customizing their own PC should sign up for Computer Shopper 
This magazine is a pretty good magazine. it has a reviews on laptops, desktops hardware, sofware, and mobile computer stuff. it also has some good articles. it is inexpensive, and tells you about every website on the net that sell computer stuff.it is made by cdnet 
Since first getting this mag from Gamestop as one of those free add on things you get when you buy games there I have come to really like it. Unlike other magazines who only seem to care about backing one system or another Game Informer talks about everything that is going on in the gaming world, even addressing the serious issues of children and M rated games 
my son had been wanting a suscription to a gamers mag and going off of the reviews i ordered this one and he thinks its great. he is 13 if you are interested 
Car and Driver is the quintessential automotive publication. The format is very user-friendly and the reporting accurate, leaving sensationalism to the other publications. That being said, the magazine is not what it once was. As others have updated their style and photography, most notably Motor Trend, Car and Driver soldiers on with its now-familiar format. And the recent departure of Brock Yates, second only to David E. Davis in automotive journalism god-ness, the magazine moves in the wrong direction. Time will tell whether Csabe Csere (the editor) can restore its preeminence 
As your grandfather told you, you can't always judge a book by its cover. Nor, these days, does the title of a magazine always clue you into the content that begins on page three. Refreshing, then, to page through an issue of CAR AND DRIVER and find that --still crazy after all these years--it's *still* about cars and drivers. Don't get me wrong; the usual suspects do appear month after month in columns that dig into one aspect or another of the auto industry. And there are those ubiquitous pages of adds from the major auto producers and the after-market confectioners of shiny things to bolt onto them. But everything else is about cars and the people who drive them. To be slightly more accurate: about cars, written by and for the people who drive them. A fair number of pages are given over to the exotic and performo varieties of the four-wheeled and the fast. But CAR AND DRIVER displays no embarrassment about majoring on the cars that the rest of drive. Or might drive or might choose never to drive, given due attention to the reviews put into the hands of drivers like this reviewer by drivers who drive for a living. 'Wanna' know what Madonna drives? Buy another magazine. 'Wanna' know what's new in the '07 Chevies, Fords, and Beemers? That would be CAR AND DRIVER 
If you like cars then Car and Driver is the magazine for you.The writers are the best and the articles are informitive 
Car and Driver is the best of the automotive- related magazines. It features numerous road tests and comparisons designed to help the consumer make a better buying decision. Most of the articles in Car and Driver deal with statistics. The magazine features several vehicles each month with loads of information on each one. They cover things like the engine size, length and width of the vehicle, acceleration rate, braking distance and much, much more. The facts are presented in an unbiased, informative way. The writers don't try to promote one car over another. They want you to know the basics and then decide for yourself which vehicle best suits your needs. In addition to individual ratings, Car and Driver also features head- to- head comparisons among vehicles in a specific category. For example, one months' featured article might be on minivans. The magazine will select a group of vehicles from this category, rate then on a scale from 1 to 10 in several categories, like handling, brakes, ride, engine, styling, etc, and then tally up the points and announce the winner. This is very useful to a potential buyer because it allows him/her to make a side by side comparison of similar vehicles. car and Driver doesn't necessarily push one brand over another because even though their point system might result in one vehicle rating superior, there are specific qualities, options, and features of certain vehicles that will make them more appealing than others- even those that rate slightly higher. The only bad point that I can come up with for this magazine is its lack of personal stories. Car and Driver is an informational magazine, with very little in the way of stories with a personal touch. If that is what you like in a magazine, then Car and Driver may not be very appealing to you. It is basically a magazine full of facts and figures. Car and Driver wants you, the consumer, to know the facts: The average distance needed to brake, the acceleration rate, the engine size, and other vital statistics. It doesn't waste its time talking about people and their cars. It concentrates only on the cold, hard facts. If you are looking for information on your next new vehicle, Car and Driver is the magazine to buy. I read several automotive magazines and they all have something to offer but Car and Driver is my favorite in its genre. It has all the data you need to make an informed buying decision. 
Car and Driver is definitely the best automotive magazine in the world. This magazine has something for everybody, whether your a person just looking for a new car or a serious car enthusiast. I have been a Car and Driver sucscriber for 6 years now and I regularly purchase the other three popular, monthly car magazines (Motor Trend, Road Track, and Automobile). By far Car and Driver is the best of the four, testing more automobiles per issue (about least twice as many as Road Track per year), conducting larger comparison tests, and generally being the most enjoyable. Car and Driver is also greater fun to read as the editors are very prone to jokes and wisecracks, and not afraid to write how they really feel about a car, no matter how good or bad it is. The road tests are comprehensive with a long list of tests performed for every vehicle, and the good points and bad points listed along with a sentence summary of the vehicle. All the reviews are unbiased (mostly), and all vehicles are compared to similar cars in the same class. The bottom line: If you want a magazine that tests more motor vehicles than any other American car magazine, prints accurate specifications and performance tests results on each one, and includes autosport articles and up to date auto news, yet you don't want to fall asleep reading it, Car and Drvier is the magazine for you.  
In USA, you can't find a better magazine. These is the magazine if you want to know the technical details on a simple but professional way, and at the same time, has great humor. Just check that the other magazines are loaded with C former talents 
I'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years. I, for one, still get something out of the writing. Can't do without my monthly dose of Harper's and The Atlantic. What I would like to point out is that why would you buy here when the subscriptions cost less on A.M.'s own website 
The Atlantic is a classic cultural, political and literary voice of America. First published by a team that included legendary icons such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, this periodical went on to include articles from great historical figures such as Mark Twain, Woodrow Wilson and Martin Luther King Jr. It may be hard to place current contributors next to those specific individuals who came before them, but they do stand tall with contemparies published in similar venues. This is not a magazine for those who currently feel they are well enough informed from the current crop of "news-tainment" programs, talking heads and mouthpieces found on the air waves today. Here you'll find in-depth, critical analysis and intelligent literature. Will you disagree with some points of view and might you feel compelled to label something in it's pages conservative or liberal? Maybe, but it's understandable in today's climate. I would suggest that you'd probably be trying too hard, perhaps unconsciously, to fit authors and articles into a particular partisan column. The letters to the editor tend to highlight differing points of view so I encourage you to read back in the following month to see how others respond to get a feel for the magazine. I think most reasonable people tend to find this magazine well worth the time to read regularly. Recently there has usually been one full length article related to an issue in the Middle East each month, which should be expected with current events, but the content varies significantly within each issue that you won't feel overwhelmed. There are regular sections and columns ranging from travel to book reviews to fiction to a "post mortem" profiling some notable world figure who has recently passed away. By way of comparison, Harper's and The New Yorker are probably the closest in style, though The New Yorker comes out weekly (mostly) instead of monthly (mostly) like the Atlantic and Harper's. If you're trying to decide between the three, pick up each of them for two or three months and see which you like best. I prefer to Atlantic overall, but if I have time, I may pick up one or the other if some particular topic in it is particularly of interest to me. Bottom line is, you could do a lot worse than subscribe to The Atlantic 
My sense is that 'The Atlantic' is a less literary magazine than it used to be. My sense is also that since the loss of Michael Kelly , a courageous and wise journalist, the magazine has declined in quality. The 'Atlantic' does however provide some of the best 'high- brow journalism' being done today. Its decision to send Bernard Henri- Levy in the footsteps of DeToscqueville may not have led to a second great classic by a foreigner about America but did provide some interesting European perceptions - and a reaffirmed sense of what is special about the United States. The 'Atlantic' is still one of the very best popular intellecual magazines in America. 
We had a subscription from 2001-2004. In the last year of that subscription, the magazine came to focus more and more on politics, and most of the political articles were written from a conservative perspective or assuming a neoconservative world view as background. Letters disagreeing with anything Robert Kaplan wrote were rarely, if ever, printed. (Though I know for a fact they received them!) We dropped our subscription and picked up the New Yorker instead. Conservatives however may want to take a new look at this magazine. The reviews suggesting it is liberal must be based on pre-2003 reading. Occasional issues we have bought since dropping our subscription confirm that the conservative slant is persisting. The quality of the writing is still reasonable however, and it explores issues in depth (albeit from one side) 
If you want to cook delicious food - get this magazine. If you want chic menus, articles about wines, diets, food trends, etc... - this magazine isn't for you. I've decided to quit wasting my money on the others with more polished style, but terrible tasting recipes. Those other magazine get thrown away each month. But, each every Taste of Home issue has a permanent spot on my cook book shelf 
I have been receiving this magazine for over two years and of all the magazines that I receive this one is my favorite. I just wish it came out monthly. The recipes presented in this magazine are really tried and true recipes. I have had great success from most of the recipes presented. Although this is a bi-monthly magazine it is well worth the wait 
I love this magazine and in each issue, I usually find one or two recipes that my friends and family will be asking for again and again! Each issue is made up of recipes contributed by cooks from all over the country, so you know a couple of things right away: 1) the recipes are doable by ordinary folks in ordinary kitchens using utensils and ingredients most people have readily at hand, and 2) this is some good cooking, because these are family recipes that in many cases have been handed down across the generations. Even though most of these recipes are made entirely from scratch (even the cakes!), they are still remarkably easy to do (and I say that as a confirmed fumblefingers in the kitchen! If I can cook these receipes, anyone can!) This is not the kind of fancy pants cooking you're going to encounter in many of the more high-end cooking magazines, this is American (or Canadian) food prepared the way most people cook in their homes. And it makes for some good eating! Each issue is built around a theme or two, usually recipes that use a featured ingredient announced in the previous months' issues, like strawberries or chicken. But there are lots of other recipes that feature the full range of dishes, from breakfast to dinner, to budget cooking and grilling, to late night snacks and children's parties. In every issue there is also usually a section that focuses on healthy foods and lists the nutritional content of the featured dishes. There are also dozens of handy kitchen and cooking tips in each issue, I have learned things I never would have thought of doing and it has made my cooking life so much easier. And the best part? No ads! Taste of Home is like belonging to a recipe club that sends you a beautiful, glossy, picture-packed magazine very month! If you like home cooking, get this magazine, you'll love it! 
I get my copies of Taste of Home as hand-me-downs. I probably wouldn't subscribe to it myself, but I can see that it is a very good magazine if you like hearty home cooking and don't already have a broad repertoire of tried-and-true recipes to rely on. Taste of Home presents family-friendly comfort food; most of the recipes are submitted by readers with a note about their origin. Each issue is packed with over 80 recipes and contains no advertising. Most dishes are made from scratch (or as close to scratch as anyone does anymore) with readily-available ingredients and easy preparation. If you are looking for trendy or exotic food you won't find it here, but you will find a seasonal selection of roasts, stews, casseroles, soups, salads, appetizers and party food, simple but lively vegetable side dishes, and easy-to-bake desserts. You will like Taste of Home if you like to try new recipes and have fairly traditional tastes in food, or if you want to try cooking (nearly) from scratch but don't want to slave for hours in the kitchen. Check out the publisher's web site to see featured articles and the recipe index for the current issue 
I love the TASTE OF HOME magazines for many reasons. There are color photos of nearly every recipe so you get an idea how the final product should look. The recipes are easy to prepare because most are made with ingredients the average household has on hand. (Nothing weird, wild nor exotic!) The paper is of a heavy, water-resistant quality. Each issue contains LOTS of recipes but not so many that you're overwhelmed. Most of the recipes are submitted by regular people, not concocted by a professional chef wearing a tall hat. And I like the homey-style. Readers can share their family's favorite meal blessing (Grace). There are cutesy stories about little kids. And although I never can find it, my aunts LOVE the toothpick contests. The best part....NO ADVERTISEMENTS!!! I can't tell much difference between the Light version and the original Taste of Home....so I usually buy both!!! If you like to cook and enjoy a quality collection of recipes, you will love the TASTE OF HOME magazines! Blessings from MenopauseLady 
PSM is the only mag i know to ever admit they underrated ICO. I quite agree with their ratings which seem to escape most of the commercial influences. The whole package doesn't glitter but it is very effective. It takes me hours to read it unlike some other mags that won't keep me busy fore more than a bus stop interval 
Alrightly. Folks it doesn't get any better than this. This magazine blends humor with serious reviewing. They will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite - like me! Anyhow, I've read this magazine for a while and I've never been disappointed. The "Ask the 800 lbs. Gorilla" section is a riot. The Bottomline gamer this is an unbiased, not corporatly owned (like OPM, and XBOX magazine) and a pleasing magazine to read. Anyone "hooked" on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a PSM and get a subscription. 
This is definately a must buy for every PS2 fan. Great reviews on popular current games, giving strong points and weak points for each reviewed game, previews on popular upcoming games, and some very helpful tips for your more popular games. Note the word "popular" as this magazine will not cover every single game out there. Comical captions here and there also make it a pleasure to read. Throw in the annual swimsuit issue which the previous reviewer mentioned, opinion pages and fan art, and there should be nothing stopping a serious PS2 gamer from subscribing to this magazine 
this magazine is the best one out there. if your a hardcore ps2 gamer, get this for a year or two. ive gotten this since it was still psone magazine and i have never seen one bad issue. they give you reviews that are %97.9 of the time helpful. you know the're serious 'cause they write down entire levels! PLUS THEY GOT SWIMSUIT ISSUES! a must for the gamer. -XESX 
I used to read the online content for this magazine (I still check out the blog), but I have to say that there is even more content in the magazine than there is online, and it's really worth subscribing. The articles are well written and usually change my mind on issues I may not have realized I had a mind to change on. I would recommend this magazine to anyone 
There are not many magazines specializing in political commentary that are really any good these days. So many of them are geared toward a political party, instead of concentrating on the issues that are most important. "Reason" magazine is the exception, and with its motto that a "free mind implies a free market" and vice versa, it has proven to be a publication that one can count on for objective analysis under the umbrella of that motto. The authors who write for it definitely have their biases, but they are attentive to these biases, and usually anticipate and answer objections to the ideas on which they expound. Many times this reviewer heard that the authors and editors of Reason are "socially liberal" but "fiscally conservative." This kind of description almost implies that their thinking is a mere hybrid of liberalism and conservatism. But this description is incorrect, for the content of the articles in Reason is a consequence of the general belief among its authors and editors that freedom, and that means first freedom of the mind, is a moral universal, regardless of the place and context in which one finds oneself. The `social liberalism' of Reason, if one is to call it that, manifests itself in the tolerance of ideas that one finds repugnant. The `fiscal conservatism' of Reason manifests itself in the belief that freedom is to be not subject to an arbitrary and coercive government that has no qualms about using deception or actual force to collect taxes, impose censorship, or generally violate individual rights. There are always many fine articles written in Reason on a diversity of topics. The advocacy of biotechnology is refreshing and reflects a common sense attitude that is very rare in political debate on this branch of technology. One will also find commentary on government waste, propaganda, torture, and the "war" on drugs. In addition, many book reviews are included on books that are relevant to the issues that the magazine wants to address. One can only hope that Reason stays afloat and delivers many more insights in the years to come. The magazine is both a barometer of freedom of thought as well as its creation. 
This monthly magazine is an opinionated breath of fresh air. It's philosophically allied with Libertarianism, but it is not extreme or strident. Reason is more mainstream and moderate than the left or the right; it's really about political common sense. I don't always agree with the articles, but I rarely object to the reasoning that supports them. For a point of view that isn't beholden to agendas or special interests, read Reason. 
For this registered Libertarian, this is a pretty good magazine. Decent articles that are written well and easy to read, as well as being informative. It has been around quite a while and the experience shows (in a positive way) 
Reason is never afraid to show opposing views. It allows you to see things in a different light. It is also nice to be able to read a magazine with articles that are greater than 3 pages 
Reason cannot be labeled conservative or leftist. Nor is it an extremist libertarian magazine like Liberty, fawning over Ayn Rand. It bases its commentary on the assumption that, if we have some faith, our chaotic culture will lead somewhere good. But if we try to monitor and control it excessively, we will dampen human creativity and end up muddled and conflicted. Reason takes on all aspects of culture and assumes an international perspective. Its arguments are laid out carefully but contain a percolating sense of indignation at our increasingly repressive environment. At the same time, they are more informative than polemical; each report is grounded in specifics - quotes, anecdotes, studies. This is the most intelligent and inquiring "political" journal available. If only it came out more often 
Buy a magazine, mail in the subscription card. The magazines are faster to first issue and if you use Amazon it is IMPOSSIBLE to change the mailing address. I got one issue, moved and tried 4 times to change address. Pretty expensive issue 
I like the magazine for fashion as well as for the informative news articles 
I love this magazine, the images are crisp, the writing consistantly to quality and the photography is always fabulous. Let's face it when a magazine coins a phrase, you know it's good. I have read GQ for several years and have found it consistantly good, though I must confess the only part that I consider must read every month is Style Guy, I don't always agree with him, but I love the questions, you really wonder if these people have ever picked up the magazine the are writing to..one never knows. The clothes they feature are usually top shelf, uh with top shelf prices as well..I mean a $2000 pair of alligator lofers..you gotta love it. If you have any interest in the latest styles and some great writing as well, then I highly recommend this book to you, though frankly I can't imagine anyone reading this that does not already have an opinion of this iconic magazine..but if you don't then by all means pick it up and form your own opinion..it's worth the effort 
Magazine was fast to ship, with all of the timeless great advice you would expect from GQ 
If you're tired of seeing the baggy jeans, XXXL T-shirts, Nike sneakers, and trashy photos that degrade women then GQ is up your alley. The quintessential read for the sophisticated man, GQ never fails to impress me with their class for the everyday man. The magazine includes columns about news, entertainment, high class (not always meaning expensive, but suitably fit) fashion, and even features ficitonal stories from both up and coming to well established authors. If your a person who wants to dress and act like an all around well put together man, then GQ is the perfect read for you 
Finally a magazine that knows cottage. Cottage isn't country, although it can have some of those elements. It isn't necessarily small, but it can be. It doesn't necessarily mean old, though it can be. Country can be modern and hip or antique and traditional. Above all, it's casual and comfortable. It's a place you want to come home to. It's a feel, an ambiance, a flair for putting things together that don't come in room-to-go packages from furniture store decorators. I especially like the various styles presented in each issue -- ultra modern, traditional, log cabin, seaside, California contemporary, etc. and the monthly comparison of styles in one furniture grouping. It allows you to grab ideas from the entire spectrum of cottage style and to mix and match for yourself. I also like how easy the how-to advice is to follow. From paint advice to luscious gardens to interesting food, this magazine has it all. The accompanying website is great. Products and paints are easy to find. I've banished all the other decorating magazines from my subscription list 
This is my favorite home/decorating/architecture magazine of all time. Perhaps it is a fortuitous coincidence, but "Cottage Living" always features homes in areas of the country that are very interesting to me - like the Adirondacks, Boulder CO, Arlington VA, Asheville NC and New Orleans. The editors have a good understanding of cottage admirers and their interests. Therefore, they include floor plans, before after pictures, and brief back-stories that give us a glimpse into the life of the cottages and of their inhabitants. We get to see that cottages have very different characters based on their geographic region, their original purpose, and the style and socioeconomic standing of their owners. Some of the homes really stretch the definition of cottage because of their large size, but - usually - they convey the spirit of a snug informal home anyway. We see that cottage owners are very ingenious about using all of the interior space that is available. I love to see how people have used dormers, areas under a staircase, and other niches for things and activities that would otherwise not be practical because of limited square footage. A small space used wisely and attractively is a challenge that all cottage owners face. This magazine provides ideas galore. [The one thing that does puzzle and annoy me about the magazine is the presence of food articles. What about living in cottage - or wanting to - has anything to do with the type of food anyone wants to prepare? I see no connection at all. Furthermore, the recipes provided seem to be very labor and ingredient intensive. I'd rather have a few more pages about the houses!] Highly recommended!  
I lean left politically and was looking for a magizine to inform and get me thinking. I tried several others, including The Nation, and settled on and subscribed to Mother Jones. While the magazine leans left, it does so in a more informed and intellectually honest way, as opposed to a rah rah banner waving way. It mixes in a bit more social commentary and investigation as opposed to political propoganda and endless articles on how to defeat the Republicans. If you're interested in a solid investigative, left leaning magazine, check out Mother Jones. Check out their web site, they have some free content and additional content that is available if you get the magazine 
This magazine confronts the most controversial and usually most important issues of our time. No mindless dribble through diversionary news (who won American Idol) in here, just the news that needs to be discussed. The issues corporate war mongers want to keep American's deaf to. 
It's a perfect magazine for people on the Left side of the aisle. It is a respectable magazine named for a respectable woman. It focuses on one subject though out the magazine and comes out each month 
Mother Jones is informing us about Trade Agreements and how we can save our jobs in the USA. When unions try to fight the corporations in order to get health benefits for their employees and not have to take cuts in their paychecks the company threatens to leave. Saying: "Like it or you won't have any jobs at all." This isn't Fair Trade, it is going for the "cheap labor" overseas. This magazine is getting the message out and I love it. They are exposing the truth about NAFTA and CAFTA. We all need more information like this so we can save the economic future of our country. If we do not, we the consumer, will not earn enough to pay for the items we buy. This means goods sit in warehouses, the company stock goes down and the stock market crashes like in 1929. We need to fix it now. Read this magazine. 
Mother Jones is what Journalism should be: gutsy, honest, no-holds barred investigative reporting. Regardless of your political party, this is one of the last vestages of honest reporting left available to us. Everything from world news, the envirnment, American politics and current events is researched thoroughly and reported honestly. A must read for people interested in more news than is available the newspaper, or in Newsweek and Time. If your tired of the pathetic blather that parades as news these days, it's time for Mother Jones. 
I just got the first issue in the subscription I sent for about a month ago. They were quick to send me my first issue. I had never heard of the magazine until they sent me a flyer highlighting what the publication was all about. I was intrigued the minute I opened the flyer, so I subscribed....blindly, I might add. The cost is right [$10] so I figured: *what the heck*! To me this is an interesting publication. Yes, it is journalism but it is refreshing and gets away from mainstream, *politically correct* gibberish. It takes a behind the scenes look, but doesn't go along with the *beat it into the ground* mentality that I get so sick of. I think it is honest and unbiased and almost reminds me of NPR [National Public Radio] reporting. You'll find a little of everything here. For instance, one of the articles in the issue I just received is another look at *The American Taliban* and his family, etc. I was amazed since we never heard anything more about the guy after they caught him. Very interesting article! They also had a story about a group of middle-aged Israeli women who monitor the actions of the soldiers in the West Bank...fascinating, humanistic story. I was completely intrigued by the story of William Zantzinger and Hattie Carroll and the song that Bob Dylan wrote about them back in 1963. Zantzinger, a white farmer, murdered Carroll, a black maid....and only served 6 months. He still lives in the same area. Wonderful story!!! Of course I ran to play the Dylan song afterward. All in all, the magazine is one I will look forward to every issue. A really pleasant surprise and a reminder to me that *you learn something new every day* is a motto to live by. I'll be subscribing for a long time 
If you are a liberal and enjoy well-thought out pieces on such various issues as Iraq to Azerbajin, this is the magazine for you. As I liberal, I look forward to every issue. Nearly every article is informative and interesting. Do not give this to a close-minded conservative. An open-minded one maybe. 
One of American evangelicalism's sympathetic critics once asked whether there is such a thing as a Christian mind. For all sorts of reasons - some more than justified - questioners, skeptics, and malnourished pilgrims have produced negative responses to the query. But perhaps things are better than all that. If encouragement ma be taken from BOOKS AND CULTURE: A CHRISTIAN REVIEW, there is hope for the kind of wide-ranging integration of faith and the intellect that is so routinely dismissed as implausible by the cynical, the misinformed and those who have yet to discover the intellectual renaissance among evangelicals that has populated university departments (philosophy and physics spring to mind as parade examples) with proponents of robust biblical faith. A publication of the Christianity Today empire, BOOKS AND CULTURE provides a forum for some of the most incisive writing and cutting-edge thinking to be found among Christians anywhere. One is not talking about puff pieces and cotton-candy testimony. Rather, the kind of thoughtful and self-critical engagement with the Great Conversation and myriad contemporary issues that one expects in the fat intellectual monthlies and the Reviews of the New York and London Times are on offer here, and in abundance. This reviewer - who fights his wife for possession issue and sometimes finds them tucked away in bedroom squirrel-holes of which she believes him to be ignorant - has watched this young-ish paper emerge as something of a renegade among evangelical organs and find its voice and stride within just a few years. Its trajectory has not been far from astonishing. CHRISTIAN CENTURY was once known for thought of this quality and still hits the occasional home run. If it cans sustain its current run, BOOKS AND CULTURE, looks rather to be the .325 hitter of which franchise glory is made 
One of my favorite magazines and one that deserves wider reading. I love the breadth of coverage ... history, current culture (though pretty much limited to American culture), politics, philosophy, science, film, music, theology and, of course, books! The reviews have gotten me to read quite a few books I otherwise would not have found. I also read First Things and do not agree that its coverage or authorship is broader, but in any case don't limit yourself to one or the other--take a look at both. You can of course access both through their web sites and see what kinds of articles are included in their issues. 
Once upon a time this little magazine serialized The Gunslinger. I cannot give it any higher personal praise than that. But if you still need some convincing... The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction is the gold standard in its genres (which are broader than the title might initially seem to suggest--there are all kinds of Fantasy and Science Fiction--and this magazine also features some horror from time to time). What Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock's Magazine are to mystery, F is to, well, F I have met some of my favorite authors in the pages of this magazine. Most recently, I read a great short story, "Finding Beauty," by Lisa Goldstein. I intend to read some of her novels as soon as I can get my hands on them. The excellent review by David Roy below covers the nuts and bolts description of this magazine pretty well, so I won't repeat what he has so concisely said already. I will however, make a nod to Charles de Lint's excellent column. If you are a voracious reader like me, you will find it of great worth and use. I encourage you to not only check out, but support Fantasy and Science Fiction. This great publication is a jewel and well worth the money and time spent reading. Fantasy and Science Fiction gets my full recommendation 
What sets FSF Mag apart from the other digest-sized magazines that deliver speculative fiction is that FSF chooses, almost every month, to transcend the genres it represents instead of remaining within the definitions and boxes that limit the other magazines. There don't seem to be any hard and fast rules concerning the stories that appear in this magazine except that they be really well written, and compellingly readable. The stories run all over the fertile woodland of Fantasy and Science Fiction and every month hold many surprises. There really hasn't been a magazine this satisfying since the old Twilight Zone magazine. In the end, it isn't about hard science or speculation about what might happen (in a scientific way). This is a magazine about stories for people who love to read them 
Ohhh, FSF, whatever would we do without you? Don't you ever change 
Fantasy and Science Fiction Magazine is full of imaginative stories every month; I have never been disappointed. The stories range in length from blasters to novellas, so no matter how much or little time one has, there is a story that will fit in. The authors are professionals who deliver well polished prose time after time. There are rarely stories at the extremes of the fantasy or sci-fi genres. I have never read about elves and dragons or about the workings of a space ship in any issue. The stories are about people, relationships, and all the strangeness we call life, as is the case with all good writing, not dazzling displays of scientific blather 
It seems almost sacriligeous to find fault with the TLS which for many is a kind of book-review Bible. But when compared to other book- review venues including the NY Times Bookreview and the NY Review of Books, I find it somehow chauvinistically British and narrowly focused. I also must admit to not liking the skimpy look of the journal. I base my remarks here not on one reading of one journal but on my general feeling after going through many many different editions of TLS over many years. Now I should qualify this by saying that there are of course many many outstanding reviews of outstanding books, and outstanding round- up surveys on special feature reviews. However when it comes to areas in which I have a degree of specialization, I usually find the taste of the reviewer so wide of mine that I end the reading with unease and dissatisfaction. 
This was actually a gift for my husband, but he was very pleased. He had been getting it gratis and loves the magazine. The order was filled expeditiously and we have already received copies 
Not only do we love the 2 issues so far that we received of Wine Spectator, but they came earlier than the 6-10 week leadtime that we were told it would take 
Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products, wine facts and education, and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year, so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material. Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine, and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings, so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80, you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis, there is often contact information, such as the name of the winery or web page, so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase. To help shoppers find the wines in each issue, Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition, because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference. Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like "World's 100 Greatest Pinot" or "The 50 Finest California Reds". Consumers are attracted to listings, and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like "This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet" or "Greatest German White Wine Ever". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues, but it could get annoying to some readers. In spite of these few annoyances, Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good, very convincing, and very persuasive. They really know wine, and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine. 
As Mr. Michael J Edelman points out in his comment, this magazine is helping people talk about a lot of things they don't quite understand. I mean what's the point of knowing that a wine has certain characteristics if you can't actually notice them? Still, Wine Spectator is the Best wine magazine today; it has the best articles and the best staff. If you want to be, as Mr. Edelman states, a yuppie blabbing about "cherry and oak", go ahead and buy it. If you want to know about the ongoing discussion about cork vs plastic, buy it. If you want to know a little more about wines, buy it. What I truly recommend is, buy the subscription, buy lots of wines and try them, understand your tastes. Once you can tell one wine from another without looking at the bottle, you can talk about wine 
as a subscriber to the washington post and a reader of usa today i can say that usa is just alot more interesting. sure it may not have all the details, but it give enough information without making it boring. the color is great as are the graphs and feature articles. it may not be good for a buisnessman looking for information but the usa today is just fine for everyday news 
This paper offers a wonderful broad perspective, and great national coverage. Doesn't take too long, but always has plenty to read. Every american should read this paper. And every adult should check out the "New Sex Now" dvd 
Ever since USA Today started publishing, it has been made fun of. And can't understand why. This a great paper that gives its readers the facts that they need to get though the day. One of the main reason that I enjoy USA Today it has little advertisements,unlike my local paper. It also give me news from everystate. USA Today is great paper for readers looking for just the facts and not alot of fluff 
Well, if you read Rolling Stone and Spin (as well as Maxim's Blender), they both have one thing in common: Both are about image and pop culture as opposed to actual musical stuff. For awhile AP got way too trendy for me. However, this magazine is on track. Whereas many of the other magazines will only discuss things from artists that are real obvious "elitist" picks and heavy sellers, this album is for people who know of other great music. It's got a lot about goth/industrial/heavy stuff, as mentioned earlier. I have to respect them because they actually had a cool article on my favorite artist of all-time, VAST. They are interesting people who like interesting things. I imagine that I'll keep my subscription of this because it's from people who clearly know what they are doing. Even though they rarely update, Industrial Nation is recommended in addition to this wonderful magazine. I wish people would find that there is a lot of good stuff there that people aren't giving a chance at 
Of all the music orientated magazines that I subscribe, Outburn is my personal favorite. This is the only magazine that caters to my favorite music...techno, goth, and industrial music. Rolling Stone stopped being relevant 10 years ago. Spin magazine is a joke. Alternative Press is also a joke and has stopped being relevant many, many moons ago. I discovered Outburn when I saw an article on one of my personal favorite bands of all time, VNV Nation. Rolling Stone, Spin, and AP wouldn't touch VNV Nation with a ten foot pole because it isn't popular with the brainwashed masses. That was last year. Since then, I have been a loyal reader as well as a loyal subscriber to the quarterly magazine. What appeals to me the most about Outburn is that the magazine covers more than just goth and industrial music but also lesser known metal bands like Lacuna Coil and Opeth. I'm not a metal fan by a long shot but it is refreshing to read a magazine in which heavy metal bands are the [pooh] that MTV and Clear Channel, er, radio plays non-stop (i.e Korn, Deftones, Limp Bizkit). Outburn covers lesser known metal bands that MTV wouldn't dare play except maybe on the new incarnation of "Headbanger's Ball". I also enjoy the original questions the writers throws at the artists and bands they interview. They also don't sound patronizing or condescending one bit. And unlike Spin magazine which has now become a forum for video games and fashion as opposed to music, Outburn sticks to what it knows best which is music. Although Marilyn Manson is on the cover of the new issue of Outburn, at least I can be grateful that the editors didn't throw Good Charlotte on the cover. Another thing I love about Outburn is the free cd offer for subscribers. Nothing beats like a free cd. My only problem with Outburn is that it is a quarterly magazine, not a monthly magazine. I wish that rags like AP, Spin, and RS were quarterly magazines and Outburn were monthly but for all its worth, at least Outburn is reliable in terms of quality articles and doesn't insult my intelligence by throwing Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera on the cover like RS did recently. Outburn is truly one of the few magazines that I can enjoy reading word for word 
One of the better weekly magazines that covers world affairs from what's on the news around the world to some pretty obscure things like Imelda Marcos' shoes to life in China, a society not at ease with the globalisation of the world. TIME did a really good article on how Google has allowed itself to be sensored in the name of finance, makes you realise that Human Rights don't exsist when the dollar signs are being totted up! The UK edition pretty much follows the USA edition, it's an easy read, and what's good is that every now and again TIME puts out a special edition which often follows a theme, the last one was on Christopher Columbus. Worth getting a subscription, also you can do what I do, when you've read a copy, give it to your local dentist or Doctor for their waiting room 
My "Time" magazine arrives like clockwork weekly in my mailbox. I am always happy to see it there among the bills and the junk mail. I recently dropped cable TV, and "Time" fills in all the gaps for me, and gives in depth reports on newsworthy events that are just glossed over on the local stations. From the big world events, including special reports like the recent Tsunami tragedy, to what's new in the science and industry world, the economy, the latest inventions and gadgets, to sports and people in the news, and TV, movie and music happenings, there is something for everbody. It's a periodical that lets me catch up on the newest terminology in the cyber world to the newest star in the hip-hop world. It amazes my kids that I would even know this. The articles seem well researched, are well written, interesting and very informative. Find out if the video game your child is playing is suitable for their age group, who we lost this week, great quotes and much more. There are excellent photos and even the letters to the editor seem more insightful and informative then anywhere else. From Politics to Fitness, from Food to Technology..it's all here. The price is right for a subscription. You get your money's worth, and will have the world at your fingertips. Keep up the pace with "Time"....Laurie 
Not as deep as MacWorld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware. Very fun to read with a unique style of writing. The reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases. The majority, though, are on target. The best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds. Overall a great addition and enjoyable read 
needed. It's just as informative as MacWorld but more fun too read. To me MacWorld is like reading a text book while Mac Addict is like learning the same information from a really funny professor. I especially like the Do-It-Yourself projects that MacAddict walks you through each month. They range in difficulty from how to build your own Mac OS X icons, to how to program your own video game in Visual Basic, to how to void your warrantee by soldering crazy stuff to the motherboard. These guys are seasoned mac geeks and they aren't afraid to help you become one too. If you're a super sensitive person, MacAddict may rub you the wrong way. Sometimes their editors make jokes that draw hate mail from the readers, like when the Polish editor in chief cracks Polish jokes. I don't mind these silly things, but some might. To me all of the jokes usually help their articles make a more concrete and lucid point. Throughout the year MacAddict has special issues devoted to topics like maintenance, practical jokes, digital media, preventing disasters, detailed OS X guides, etc. I find these invaluable. I'm the guy my friends ask for mac help, not because I'm smarter than other people, but because I've been reading this great magazine for 6 year 
Let's face it ....... owning a Mac is like owning a Harley or an Airstream. It's a cult!!! Good fun. Harmless as can be and it just makes you feel good everytime you sit down at your Mac. Having a magazine come every month with a bunch of foolishness about this very slick machine increases the joy way more than the magazine price. I read it from cover to cover and even believe some of it 
If you read some of the older reviews some make the comment that Mac Addict isn't what it used to be. I'm not sure what they're getting at with that. This magazine has been steadily improving over the years. Lots of reviews, and the included CD is a great tool, filled with free ware, share ware, and samples of commercial software that allow you to try the program before buying it. If your a Mac engineer it may not be enough for you, but for most of us this is a good source of info 
This magazine is totally awesome. from the excellent software on the disk, to the FREAKIN-AWESOME reviews, to the silly humor and funny letters on the back pages, this magazine is for any mac user who want's more than the professional MacWorld can give Projecting humor into a computer magazine is not something many editors can do, bu Rik Myslewski (spelling?) does a great job. I totally recommend it 
I have been subscribed for little over a year now (no discs on my magazines though - they must have phased this out). I look forward to the day my Mac Addict arrives as it is always full of great tips to make life easier. A must have for anyone who owns a Mac, this magazine contains useful tips, troubleshooting, guides to free downloads, and loads of tech support. I especially love the Q section, and find that this part is the most useful to my day to day computing needs. I have just renewed my subscription for another year 
As far is the writing is concerned this is a top notch rock magazine. The format is appealing and the pages are not marred by one too many ads. Another plus is the CD that comes with each issue ; this might help justify the cost. The original CD's are priceless with real gems that the average music listener may not have heard of. They choose a theme and run with it, creating an eclectic mix of artists to illustrate their theme.Take for example a few months back when it was legendary tracks from Studio One in Jaimaca where it featured little known artists among reggae afficionados like Ernest Ranglin, Michigan and Smiley next to giants like Bob Marley, The Skatalites for a complete view of the important record label of reggae. I really enjoy the monthly features including tributes to those that passed away in the month entitled "Real Gone." Old rock stars are going faster than they did in the seventies! Other good features are the brief reviews of music indexed as Filter reissues, reissues extra, tracks,buried treasure an just plain Filter Albums(current stuff). The in depth articles of the cover subject are very entertaining and what actually drew me to Mojo intially for information. There is one draw back for US subsrcibers, it is a long way acros the pond and problems will occurr. In the last year my problems have been as follows: was receiving my issues two weeks after the stores had copies, missing CD's. To their credit both problems were solved in spite of having to send three issues so that I would finally get my ripped off CD, it was stole twice! Subscriber beware. Sending it in clear plastic with the words CD inside is just an invitation to a thief. Otherwise it is maybe the best rock music magazine out there and I defintely recommend the Brits perspective 
Since its fisrt issue in 1994, Mojo magazine is THE SOURCE for all things rock and roll. What I love most about this magazine is that they do ridiculously exaustive articles on semi-obscure but important groups of past and present. Where else would you read a 19 page story about the making of Ogden's Nut Gone Flake, or the cultural importance of the Purple Rain soundtrack? The writing in this magazine is so great that they can make a synopsis of the son of Ringo Starr's musical career be the most interesting thing you've ever read. The British music journalism market is as cutthroat as it gets, and only the best publications survive. My biggest concern is that after more than 10 years of such writing that subject matter become a shortage to where they begin recycle articles from past issues because they ran out of bands to write about. That is to say it is not totally without flaw. British music magazines have this awful habit of putting together these 'best albums ever made' lists every two years with questionable entries. Sorry, but calling Kula Shaker the 27th best band of all time in 1997 is just stupid. Also, since this is imported from the UK (would it really but their balls to have a US publishing outlet like a majority of magazines out there?) you not only pay a hefty price for it, it is hit or miss that you end up with the included CD that comes with it. 
If you are one whose definition of rock music is fairly elastic and whose taste in rock music is eclectic, then I recommend Mojo Magazine to you. I haven't read all magazines relating to music of course, but of those I have, Mojo does the best job covering the music scene today. Its approach is fresh and its appeal wide. Unlike some of the other music mags around, it is one that the whole family can read and probably find something musically meaningful to each. Its writers, whose taste in music is broad, approach music without allowing personal prejudices to color their articles. They can find as much merit in a new Nick Cave CD as they do in a new Bert Bacharach effort, if the music is worthwhile and they do it without gushing. A recent issue highlighted Bob Dylan, Marianne Faithfull, and Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols each of which certainly appeal to different audiences. The thing I like best about Mojo is that each issue comes with a CD featuring various artists doing whatever type of music that is the focus of the month's lead article. The CD really adds value and has me anticipating the next one. I never thought I'd like the Sex Pistols, but when I heard the feature CD of songs that influenced them, I understood their music a lot better. You might get a better deal on the magazine than is offered here if you go to the bookstore, find the magazine, and look for an insert bearing a special offer. That's what I did. Whatever way you decide to try the magazine is up to you, but I'd be surprised if you didn't find it informative, enjoyable, and money well spent 
MOJO magazine is simply the best reading a music lover can get their hands on in the 21st century ! It covers rock and roll ,and all its off shoots, from back when "ROCK" meant everything to its early fans ; recommended for those of us with an English rock music addiction : The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Hendrix ,The Who,Yardbirds ,Pretty Things, Genesis, Hawkwind ,Motorhead, Nick Drake, Fairport Convention, etc.Usually available at Borders and Barnes Noble the 15th of each month. Howard D. White, collector 
My head pulsates with useless music trivia and knowledge, most it from reading magazines like "Mojo." Let's face it - the Brits have the market cornered on quality music-centric publications right now with this one, "Classic Rock," "Q," and, occasionally, "Uncut," - but "Mojo's" editors need to get over their obsessive compulsive infatuation with The Beatles and Bob Dylan, both of whom's influence and importance in the grand scheme of rock and roll's lore has been grossly overrated. Live with it (and let the hate mail start rolling)! That minor caveat out of the way, "Mojo's" writing is the essence of drive, simplicity, and reverence for its subject matter (two words - Ben Edmonds), no small feat. Their feature articles are loaded with facts and information even I've never read before and the layout is spot-on brilliant. And how's this for innovation? The reviews section skimps on neither quantity nor quality. While I can't pretend to automatically snap up each issue of "Mojo" like I do with "Classic Rock," I'm usually on the latest issue at my newstand like dirt on a dog, as evidenced by the stack of back issues at Casa Paull which now towers above all three of my kids. And if all of this isn't enough, most issues come with a free sampler CD of tunes at least marginally related to the cover story - that's called "gravy." Oh yeah, I almost forgot. It's not half-full of ads, like "Rolling Stone." Highly recommended. 
If you are a fan of a certain genre of music,be it mainstream pop, punk or hip-hop, there are at least a few magazines to cater to your taste. The rarity is a magazine that caters to the all-around pop music fanatic, and Mojo Magazine tops that obscure list. This is a pricey publication, but well worth the money. Since discovering the magazine several years ago, I have been amazed at the diversity in the cover features alone: The Beatles, ABBA, Frank Zappa, Kate Bush, The White Stripes, Michael Jackson, Rolling Stones, Sex Pistols, Madonna... there is something for everybody's taste, and plenty for people with a wide range of musical taste. Cover features inside, I am always amazed at the space they give to performers and/or bands that have a small cult following. I especially enjoyed the piece they did on The Incredible String Band several years back. As they usually do when covering a group's history, the Mojo writers do not shy away from the friction and low points involved in the band's career. No tabloid trash-talking or finger pointing, just good solid journalism; showing the strengths that makes an icon's popularity endure, and the bumps in the road that ended the ride. The reviews of CDs are plenty, and I often find myself discovering something new to add to my collection. You'll find reviews of pop, punk, folk, blues, country, classic rock, you name it! I also find the reviewers to be a lot more open minded when reviewing albums, which is a welcome holiday from the plethora of snobbish music critics who go out of their way to trash good efforts. Mojo, in my humble opinion, is top of the music mags. If you are an over all pop-culture fan like I am, and are always on the lookout for something new to add to your collection, then Mojo Magazine should be a key resource in your database! 
Actually, it deserves 4.5 stars. This is a Brit magazine that offers great articles that cover classic bands' tales as much as keeping you tuned in to the latest waves of musicians, from Americana to Blues to Brit Pop. There's at least one excellent, long article per issue which will tell you more about bands you thought you knew about than any magazine published in USA (check old issues for Dylan's or Pink Floyd's, for instance). If you are old enough to remember Rolling Stone when it concerned itself with musicians and other artists creating new boundaries for popular art, rather than catering the current, pathetic BritneySpear-NightmareMachine ... you would enjoy Mojo. Tip: you can get any single issue at B, Borders or Tower Records for the same amount, that way if you don't like it you won't have to mourn 100 bucks 
No question. If you followed ALL movie magazines, even the sci-fi and fantasy spin-offs, quick VHS magazines (remember those!) then you should also remember about the time BATMAN premiered (what great movie hype!) Empire Magazine ran its first issue and then the great BATMAN #2 issue and we have not stopped collecting since, nearing issue 200 now as I write this, it has been a good one so far and I am sure will keep up the same pace for all new to the greatest `non-digital' monthly pages on the planet, I urge young and old alike to start collecting and reading now. Empire has the best letter editor quick reply page, best movie news section that is fairly reliable, some interesting actor introductions, then the SOLID MOVIE REVIEW SECTION that is pretty much the most effective appraised segment in any magazine on any planet and to think that it is about films makes it all the more better. Film personality, editorial and staff movie trivia segments, inside scoops, Questions and Answers about how much is a bottle of milk, Empire helped get us closer to these people who made us so happy at the silver screen and to that I have Empire to thank. The spine quotes at the side that can win us a T-shirt, the new DVD section (I lived for the old VHS one) your designers really knew what made us young impressionably men do in the bathroom with Michelle Pfeiffer in the mid-section, thanks for that also and I end this review by saying that if there was any magazine in the world that I would like to write for, I would give my left one for these people. This is truly amazing film work... and yeah, it does leave Premiere magazine to go pound on sand. Try it 
I am a loyal,long time fan of EMPIRE magazine and have collected almost every issue from No.1. Being a British mag, it differentiates itself from others like Premiere and Entertainment Weekly by it's frank dissection of all movies, and provides a wide range of opinion and discussion. I will always read EMPIRE, and If you like movies, you should too. 
This magazine seems too perfectly tailored to me, much the way I felt when I discovered Harry Knowles' Aint it cool News. As a monthly movie mag that pushes near 200 pages an issue, this blows the nearest US genre mag (CFQ, 6 issues a year, 80+ oages) to hell, and contains little to none of the 'snobery' of most domestic movie mags. Great mag for the movie lover who likes healthy doses of fun and humor with sincere film anaysis 
I like Shape because it has great tips to help spice up a workout so you never get bored. There are great articles on places to stay, hike, relax, etc. As well, there are great inspirational stories 
Their work out are very effective if you comply with the guideliness for each move and routine. I love it!!! Been a member for 2 years already 
I read the other reviews, and I have to agree that this magazine isn't entirely fitness, but that's what I like about it. I'm just starting to adopt a healthier lifestyle and this magazine has great articles on new exercises, interesting recipes, and cool beauty tips that are geared more towards natural remedies. Anyone who is working out regularly has the habit of feeling bored after awhile. Getting this magazine once a month boosts my excitment about making myself healthier and gets my butt back in the gym. My favorite feature of this month was a new stationary bike routine, complete with interval times, resistance levels, and an MP3 playlist to correspond with the tempo of the workout!! Great idea. 
This is by far my favorite magazine. The pictures are excellent, the articles are informative and hilarious, it gives information on movies years in advance and the reviews are reliable. The best part about this magazine however is that every time I look through it I find something new 
Spike Fett is mistaken. The 100 Greatest Moments he mentions is not for ALL TIME. They were the top 100 moments of the magazines lifetime, which is only 8 years. This is one of the best film/dvd magazines out there. I highly reccomend it. It has awesome articles, reliable reviews, and great color photos. Another thing I like about it is that its an British publication, so you get a different opinion and point of view. Its a great magazine. 
I have been a reader fan of Dog World since I had my first dogs in 1981. Being an avid dog-lover since childhood, I have always enjoyed the breeder ads discovering breeds new to me. These days one of my favorite sections is the "rare breeds". I thoroughly enjoy the bi-annual "all breed" special issue. Although each issue does profile a breed of dog, what I like better than Dog Fancy is that the profiles are more informative in-depth. Dog World also covers rare breeds in their profiles, not just AKC breeds. I would recommend Dog World for dog professionals avid dog-lovers involved in dog sports; and Dog Fancy for the more casual dog people 
Having recieved both DogFancy and DogWorld, I prefer DogWorld. I have found that DogFancy tends to focus more on purebreds and AKC events than on the general, everyday mutts of America and what the owner of one can do with them. As an owner of a shelter mutt, I appreciate DogWorld's emphasis on the world of dogs- their nutrition, health/care, exercise, and varied news paragraphs. I especially like the column on agility training- it is as beneficial to agility persons as well as great advice for any other sport- flyball, obedience, herding/hunting trials, etc. since all sports deal with pretty much the same mental and physical aspects. I also really enjoy the different sports they highlight in each issue. The only thing about DogWorld that bothers me is its series articles. If you don't follow one series to completion you get confused and sometimes the series are more geared to the professional world (veternarians and trainers) than to the 'regular' folk. DogWorld gives a much more rounded view of the world of dogs and what can be done with them than DogFancy which tends to focus on more of the breeding side of the world and AKC 
I was drawn to this publication by the haunting image of Shep (from Blue Peter) calling me to read more. I dunno how close John Leslie and Shep were, but you can read a very probing(!) interview, which examines the closeness of the relationship and how such a lovely fluffy animal can become part of the family, like an aunt or uncle 
I think this is one of the better dog magazines out there. The articles are varied, informative and well-researched 
This is not the kind of magazine you read, at least not cover to cover. This is for serious shopping, or shopping ideas. Feel a whole in your wardrobe? Lucky can tell you what to put in it for a variety of price ranges. That is one of the reasons I really like this magazine it shows different price ranges of a style so you can decide how much you want to spend on the perfect look. It also gives great website types, which is very helpful when your stuck out in the middle of the continent. The "everyday girl" advice on mixing and maxing is often lacking, but the magazine makes up for it with pages of clothing, shoes, etc. Devoted to shopping, pick this up 
I thought, eh, Lucky magazine, i don't really need this anymore... so I broke it off. (I am a college student, so, I'm a little bit poor. Lol.) I was wrong. I love Lucky. I know fashion and trends are kind of an "air head" market, but I'm going to subscribe again because: A.) I am a design student, and fashion and trends are chock full of design elements B.) I subscribe to Newsweek and I watch the news all the time. It is depressing, Lucky is not. C.)After coming home from a long day of classes and work, it's not so bad to want to read something with lots of pretty pictures, is it? (The answer is no, that is not bad.) Lucky rocks. Seriously. If you want something that's fun to read and fun to look at it's great. I don't recommend it for people who are in deep credit card debt becasue they just HAD to have the latest designer handbag, becuase this will get you into trouble. FOr everyone else, who just wants to look hip... or just plain sytled. Lucky is a great magazine 
Even if this magazine is a mag-a-log, what would we do without it? September issue rocks with Eva Mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside. The biggest news? Lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic. It's about time technology got up with our lifestyle 
This magazine single-handedly taught me how to dress with style- and believe me- that's no small feat. I love how Lucky shows how to put pieces together to look fabulous without mindlessly following the crowd. If that's all I had interest in, then I could've simply bought the Lucky shopping guide book. But their reviews of up and coming clothing and jewelry designers, hair, makeup, home decor, and the "How I'm Wired" sections keep me coming back to the magazine. Plus the Lucky Breaks are awesome. My only complaint is the average price of their featured raved-about items. What Lucky is for me is a fantastic template for fashion and style that I can use to find similar items at cheaper prices in stores like H, Target, etc. It's so worth the $12/year, and I look anxiously at the beginning of each month for its arrival in my mailbox 
I actually really love this magazine. The articles are down to earth and helpful...not cheesy and shallow, like those found in Cosmo. The editorial staff of Lucky seems to really relate to real women and aren't "bitchy and pretentious," like other women's magazines 
I really love this magazine because it not only shows great new products, it also reminds you of old faves. Lucky keeps you up on the trends but also gives you tips for the classics. I've gotten this subscription for my shoppin' loving girlfriends. Makes a great, "indulgent" gift that keeps giving all year long. 
Lucky is a great magazine to look at and then look at again. It usually takes me a couple of hours to look at all the fashions. I have discovered some great fashion websites because of the magazine but other than that I can't say I can actually go out and buy anything they feature. Even the up and coming designers are out of my price range. They used to feature affordable fashions but now they seem to have fallen in love with the name brand or boutique stuff. Plus, can we please have these New York magazines stop talking about H M. There is no H M stores where I live. So stop toying with me 
This is by far the best design magazine anywhere. The price might be daunting but, beyond being on the bleeding edge content-wise, issues are typically loaded with custom papers, finishes, a fold out poster, postcards, and other generally inspiring material. If you are tired of yuppie design rags and are looking for great work that spans an incredible range (every month), this is it. Not for "8 ways to better drop shadows" types. This is the real deal 
A most excellent magazine. I have had a subscription for this magazine for several years and have never been disappointed! This magazine is comparible to Maxim and FHM in the States. However it is greatly superior. The photography is excellent and contains more nudity than than maxim or similar magazines. 
Basically this magazine is a British Maxim. Same humor, same layout, same themes. The reason I like it more than Maxim is because I'm really into British culture, so I obviously have an interest in the view pointo of the magiazine. So if your interested in babes, pop culture, and sex, stick with one of your American equivalents. But if your looking for the same things in Britain, then this is the magazine for you 
This self-described 'Handbook of the American Entrepeneur' is one fine piece of work. I read it cover to cover upon arrival. INC. is the kind of practical brain food with just the right touch of attitude that keeps ideas spinning and feeds the pragmatic lobe of the brain with excellent practical tips. When compared to FAST COMPANY, its main competitor, INC. is the more conventional entrepeneur's read. It is to the entrepeneur what MONEY magazine is to the personal investor. When you run your own company, you get a little uppity. Everybody who wastes your time is stealing your money. Every vacuous pontification robs your time. INC. communicates that kind of I'm-responsible-for-this-gig-so-don't-waste-my-time attitude without posing. Some great editing makes for innovative article selection, like the October 2006 ranking of state governor's according to what they've done for the entrepeneurial climate in their realm. Don't think twice. Go for INC 
If you have your own small business or start-up, or are even slightly thinking about starting one, this magazine is well worth the small cost. I usually bring mine on the plane along with a couple others 
I ordered a free trial of this mag a while back, before starting my own e-business recently. Immediately I began a subscription. The reviews from pros on REAL businesses offer a lot of insight while the profiles give it a real world feel. I would recommend this to anyone even considering working in the high ranks of any business. Keeps you informed and in touch. 
I subscribe to Inc.. Although I am not a business owner, yet, I find the articles to be informative and the magazine a useful resource. As an accomplished song writer and aspiring song seller, the article on (...)-May 2005- made me aware of a resource that I did know was available. Check that one out. With Joe Mansueto, CEO of Morningstar and self-confessed fan of Inc., acquiring the magazine I can only imagine the great things ahead. The full-page N.Y. Times ad reinforces Mansueto's commitment to growing the brand. Can't wait for future issues 
I have been a subscriber to Inc. for several years. It is one of the few magazines that discusses the personalities, struggles, successes and failures of businesses of many sizes. It's a key resource for anyone considering starting their own business, working in a family or other small business. The writing is top notch, the subjects intelligent. A breeze to read 
Computer Gaming World has been around since the early 80's and it's always been the best in my opinion. A lot of people think their reviewing style is a bit harsh, but given the price of games and how much garbage is released, you really can't afford not to read reviews before buying. Computer Gaming World gives concise, critical reviews that explain exactly what is good and bad about games on the market. Highly recommended 
I have been a subscriber to CGW for about a year and have been pleased with their coverage of PC games. In addition to having a healthy dose of advertisements, the typical issue includes previews of upcoming games, reviews of released games, and a hardware commentary section. The articles are generally well written, even with some humor thrown in. I plan to remain a subscriber and would recommend the magazine to anyone who plays computer games 
My son in law insists that I give him a subscription to this magazine every year for his birthday. He really looks forward to it. 
This publication is very imformative and helpful for the beginner or hobbyist 
Seventeen was probably the most unappealing magazine to me when I was in middle school. I bought my first issue in July 2003 because they didn't have my beloved Cosmogirl at the airport. I don't know who the editor was back then, but thank goodness for Atoosa. She changed the magazine around. Seventeen has nice clothing ads. Most of the clothes are affordable things which happen to have a universal appeal. Although sometimes the outfits featured are quite boring, there won't be something you don't like. The makeup is alright too, nothing special except for the occasional bit. The serious stories are great, nothing too overpowering, and plus there are warnings for graphic stories to keep your mind at peace. For you occasional magazine readers, the best time to buy this magazine is for back-to-school. Age reccomendation: 13-19 (seriously. 
Growing up in the church, I've received a lot of Christian magazines, from in depth analysis on Scripture, to Q on highschool drama help, but all have fallen short of what young Christians today are looking for. I followed Relevant magazine before they released their 1st magazine and kept up with the amazing articles online. I was very excited for the debut of a magazine that made God relevant to specific everyday life decisions and made God seem ever more practical in the way we construct our lifestyles. God has obviously done great things with this staff and is still working. Their podcast is also great and really demonstrates the character of today's young christian thinkers who are excited in their faith and are willing to show it. They bring a lot to hope and pray for for the Christians living in a culture that denies Christ. I'm not a twentysomething quite yet, but the message of Relevant is important which is: put away with your indifference and go out and make a mark on culture for the glory of God 
I wish I could give this magazine 6 stars. Finally, an honest magazine for Christians. I am the target demographic, so I understand the style does not appeal to all, but the content can easily relate to anyone who is willing to get past their pre-concieved religious notions and desire Biblical truth. I sometimes get sick of the 'relevant' move because it frequently becomes used as an excuse for Christians to abuse their freedom as believers, but Relevant does a fantastic job of giving a balanced look at relevant faith. I don't always agree with every article, but I appreciate the open, honest, and sometimes opposing views. It is not a one-sided, or single minded publication. I wish I could afford to get a subscription for all the Christians I know 
I have been receiving Relevant since the first issue. Every issue I receive I look at, read a few of the articles, and head right to the movie review and CD review section where they rate not just the music lyrics, but the quality, and spiritual content. That has been useful (as oposed to the traditional avoid all secular music OR the gamble I used to take at the CD store). The look and feel of the magazine is quite nice - I know that these folks are doing their best to create an inticing and fresh look to the pages - and it is working. Honesty about Christianity is important to me - and after spending a couple of issues with Relevant - you will see it is to them. They have a freshness in wrestling with struggles and quetions without quenching the longing for pursuing God in my heart. Lastly, there seems to be many people out there who just want to make money off magazine subscriptions. I appreciate the cost of this mag - they keep it affordable which means it fits in my budget...something that less and less is able to do these days 
RELEVANT is a magazine that reaches our culture, rather than form its own Christian sub-culture. While the magazine is definetly aimed towards the "20-something" demographic it still can speak to all generations. It covers the most important topics facing our world today, Christian and secular. It also covers books, movies and good music. Interviews include, Cameron Crow (director of "elizabethtown" "vanilla sky"), Bono of U2, Lovedrug and Copeland. The writing can be somewhat shallow at times, but overall isn't bad. The magazine fit finish is second to none in the Christian magazine market, with thick glossy pages and colrful, thick covers, although it could be longer. This is surely one of the best Christian mags out there today. If your a Christian and are ready to move Christianity into the next generation, I would highly recomend this magazine. If you like music I would recomend PASTE magazine, its is owned by a Christian and covers some of the most excellent music around today 
I think that begs the question on most everyone's mind in America. Pop culture is king. Few know it, but everyone believes it, whether consciously or sub-consciously is the question. Relevant magazone shows us that God doesn't only exist in the front pew of a church anymore. The progressive Christian, the one you can find at The Door on Friday and Saturday nights in Deep Ellem Texas, that is who this mag focuses on. But don't think that you are required to have tatoos to read it. This month's issue (July_August2 2005) that I just bought has an honest and real article on pre-marital sex. But I am not typing now to review that particular article, go to my chat forum if you want to see that. In short, this mag has been long awaited and it sky-rocketing its way up the ropes in modern america. Why? Go read it and find out. Jesus is alive 
In a day and age where the twentysomething Christian feels like they could either live as a real person in society or cut themselves off into the small little world of Christian culture, Relevant Magazine alone realized the true approach of being "in the world, but not of the world." The magazine builds up and encourages the twentysomething Christian by speaking our language. From spotlights on Christians in the worlds of entertainment, sports, etc., to devotionals written by some really great Christian writers, to suggestions on handling sex, money, and the pressures of being in this generation, to reviews of books, movies, and both secular and Christian music. This is a magazine for the everyday Christian who finds himself in this world we're in and, rather than play a seperatist monk, wishes to reach out and be relevant to the world that he/she is supposed to spread the gospel to 
My wife and I love this magazine. It offers objective reviews of kitchen equipment, which is rare. The recipes are very much a step up from what you get in the family magazines (Good Housekeeping, Sunset, etc.) without being so elaborate that you are not motivated to try them as is sometimes the case with some of the dedicated food magazines. And, the helpful hints are actually helpful! Another appreciation is that the magazine is limited in the number of recipes per month. I find that helps provide some focus. I do feel obliged to let you know that you will receive a noticeable amount of mail from their mailing list. To me, this is a very minor annoyance and it doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the magazine. But, it is something you should be aware of 
The magazine is based on the work of an actual test kitchen outside of Boston, MA. It is thorough and focused and right on. I have also found it to be very impressive because it is printed on recycled paper and it isn't your typical publication with glossy paper and lots of photos. In fact, pictures that are found within its pages are drawn by staff members, thus "illustrated". You'd be surprised at how great it is. It leaves you with a feeling of nostalgia with every delivery. It is also written with great clarity. Plus, you'll find literal gifts to yourself in every issue, atypical of most others. There are, of course, terrific recipes. Then you'll find equipment ratings, taste tests and comparisons, suggestions for supplies, herbs and spices, specialty foods, tips and techniques, shortcuts, etc. One of my most favorite areas is the editorial from the publisher in the beginning of each issue. I love his down to earth, somewhat quirky style of writing as it is always interesting and always intelligent. If you go to their website, name of magazine, you'll find good deals on subscriptions and they will send you a free issue. There is something for everyone here....the novice cook and the accomplished chef. Highly recommended. 
Quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine I have ever subscribed to that I actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months. I like it so much I am writing my first Amazon review! The format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes - they are always printed on two pages across from each other - and unlike some of the other posters I prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and doesn't tear easily. Having tear away ads (for their own products) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion doesn't take up much space on my shelf. The recipes are easy to follow and usually clear. When they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed. Their product reviews are terrific - I wish I hadn't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta. My only gripe, as someone who does not have a dishwasher, is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require. I have made at least half the recipes from the magazines, many several times, which is no small feat for a "flexitarian" who never has meat as a main dish. 
This is an excellent Magazine but I would have saved $ 7.00 on an annual subscription by buying it with the enclosed postcard rather than through Amazon. Also I have to wait 12 weeks to receive the first issue!! My Bad 
If you are a savvy food geek or just like to cook, the indepth information presented in this magazine is thourough, scientific,and well researched. Amazing 
If you're short on time or just looking for new ideas, this is the place to turn. Mailbox magazine offers interesting ideas, printables, and many other items. It is really worth the money 
I love this magazine. It is EASY reading and what you read is easy to digest. There are so many tidbits of information that I find so useful. It makes me want to live a healthier life, and also have a healthier family. Since subscribing to it, I find that I have changed the way I do a lot of things. It's my favorite magazine which I compare to a ray of sunshine. 
Prevention is more of a guilty pleasure to me than anything else. It's definitely not a magazine that you file away with your beloved books (I do that with Victoria, Real Simple, and O), but you take a little something from each issue. It does contain a lot of excellent information ranging from herbs to emotional health to physical conditions, but the articles are really more than one or two pages long (at the most) and it doesn't take long to read from cover to cover. Regardless, I enjoy it, and usually learn something new and interesting with each issue. I'm not a complete health nut, but I am interested in long term issues and try to look out for myself. Most health magazines (with the exception of Health) are too specific- each article really only applies to a certain group of people, but most of the articles in Prevention apply to the entire readership as a whole. There's very few of us out there not struggling with stress or interested in ways of preventing heart disease or cancer 
In every issue I always find a good review, and very good tips on making me more productive with mi Mac Mini 
No, I'm not a salesman for Macworld -- at least, they're not paying me anything for being one. I only know, as an owner of Macs for over 25 years, that Macworld will repeatedly show you how to do things that (1) you always wanted to do on a Mac, and (2) you didn't know you could do on ANY computer. See, a key reason you're buying a Mac is that it makes it possible to do so very many things easily that a PC either can't do or makes very difficult. Right? Well, as easy as Macs do make most things, there are still a lot of details that can be hard to absorb quickly when you're just trying to make things work. Especially when you feel as though you could erase something vital accidentally with just the push the wrong button. MACWORLD GETS THAT, and has LOTS of easy-to-undertstand articles on how to reduce your fears, get things done, and even simplify the processes in the long run. Plus, they have a website, where you can look up past and side articles that pertain to exactly what you are trying to do. In addition, as a new Mac owner, you'll find that there are tons of outside companies -- large and small -- that make software and peripherals for Macs. Most are very good, but some are so geek-centric that it can be hard to understand whether what they have to offer is beneficial to you or just more crap on your system. Macworld is very smart about helping you understand which ones to pay attention to and which ones to avoid. Lastly, I suggest you think of Macworld as you would a guide to your favorite hobby. That is, it's likely to have a lot of information that you know, but it will also constantly update you on aspects that you don't. Plus, since new products come out constantly for the Mac, it will also keep you up-to-date on what's available that may or may not make sense for you. In the long run, I predict that you'll soon find a Macworld subscription to be one of the cheapest (and most valuable) investments you've ever made. And good luck with your new Mac. Welcome to the fold 
Macworld's glossy monthly has been around for about as long as Apple has been making Macs. I've been a subscriber for most of that time and - if I had saved past issues - could probably paper Cupertino's main streets with this periodical's pages. There are a number of magazines devoted to Macs and their unusually devoted users. Macworld is probably the most mainstream and dependable of them. As with most periodicals dedicated to high-tech fields, there is more in these pages than the casual user can digest. Many of the articles appeal to the MacGroupies subset of MacUsers, those who find the product fascinating in itself rather than merely a boon to productivity dedicated to other ends. However, even a normal MacUser like myself (since 1987) can enjoy the coverage of all things Apple, including the constant improvements for which the company has become known and the relentless speculation about What Comes Next. A small tornado of a controversy brews in the pages over whether Macworld should dedicate so much space to iPod and music issues, but Apple seems to have fairly dictated by its sprint in that direction that a magazine dedicated to covering the company's products will need to follow the direction it sets. There are lots of productivity hints that - if followed - will keep you increasing your own effectiveness on the machine. The most useful feature for me has been the high-quality discussion of the improvements Apple continues to build into its own operating system(s). Macworld is the go-to Mac magazine, if that's what you need 
Five ESSENTIAL Stars. Macworld Magazine is the one magazine that has it ALL in one convenient place and is absolutely necessary for the Macintosh computer user. Published monthly, it is chock full of articles on and reviews of the latest Macintosh/Apple equipment, software, applications, games, browsers, neat websites, and other essential products and services. From the "FEEDBACK" letters to the editor that have real substance, to an extensive "REVIEWS section covering areas like cameras, camcorders, printers, notebooks, laptops, desktops, CD DVD recorders, etc.., to the in-depth "SECRETS" covering areas like 'the Working (office or home office) Mac', 'Digital Photo', 'Mobile Mac', 'Geek Factor', the awesome Mac OSX 'Help Desk', and the essential helpmate 'Mac 911', Macworld is the Gold Standard. It even has regular tutorials for the daring Darwin UNIX user, giving the real geeks a literal software tool kit into the inner workings of Steve Job's marvelous computer (only for the most experienced expert user). Even in cases when another magazine has a similar article, Macworld always seems to do it better, probably because it has been at the Mac publishing game longer than any other magazine to my knowledge. The arrival of Macworld magazine at your home or office each month will cause you to set aside an hour or two to read the magazine from cover to cover, and if you're like me, store it for future use. Some competing Mac magazines come with a monthly CD disk with applications, utilities, and games, but Macworld has an interesting solution in this area: they provide a "Virtual CD", based on a URL, found at the bottom of the table of contents, that leads you to a webpage full of monthly surprises normally found on a monthly disk, eliminating the need for an evergrowing stash of computer magazine CDs. Plus you have access to previous month's articles and columns. Great idea. Five Big "CORE DUO" Stars! 
MacWorld is required reading for the serious Mac user. It reports the latest changes in Mac software and hardware from both Apple and third-party vendors. Reviews of the latest products are essential so that you can decide when to upgrade your existing system 
It always seems like a holiday when my UTNE arrives. It has never failed to delight me in my long tenure as a subscriber and fan. Nowadays, with so much of our "news" actually being political spin and hype, with that forced-fed feeling, it is so refreshing to be able to read interesting, tasty, thoroughly satisfying stuff that is not the run-of-the mill, banal, overly celebrity-focused junk. [Hey, I like celebrities just as much as the next guy, but I like to take a break once-in-a-while.] UTNE respects your intelligence. It seems to arrive just on time, every time. The focus here is on improving one's life and, perhaps, one's corner of the world (or just a corner of a room). Sure, there is a progressive bent to the content (it used to be dubbed "the best of the alternative media"): there's ample pro-environment, pro-organic, pro-diversity, pro-spirituality content here. [Have they made "progressive" a dirty word, too???] I find it consistently conducive to recharging my batteries. GO FOR IT. YOU WILL BE AMPLY REWARDED. Like entering a fresh, new world every two months. You will likely read it from cover-to-cover 
Hello, this will be the third time in the last many years that I've received, and read, UR on a regular basis. I agree with most of the other reviews. However, what I find most outstanding about the magazine is how uplifting, and ultimately positive, it is. I subcribe to several dozen web sites, from the media from around the world, most of which are far left of "liberal." While I take everything that I receive, through all forms of media, with a very large "grain of salt," I do tend to put much more stock in what I read on the web than I do in what the mainstream media feeds us, especially that from the U.S. Therefore, as a result of that reading, I often feel sorrow, rage, cynicism, and/or depression. Utne's positive spin on issues, even when the subject is inherently distressful, inspires me, as almost no other form of media does (except, sometimes, music), to rise up out of any negativity that I may be indulging in, and take positive steps toward helping to make our world a better place for us all. For that, I am very grateful to everyone who is responsible for such a fine magazine. Thank you, Utne 
I watch Paula on TV as often as I can and the magazine gives another chance to get her recipes and see all the things she is up to. I really enjoyed the two copies of the magazine that I have read Keep up the good work and Thank You for being a real down home southern country girl. Me too 
I ordered this magazine for my grandmother, as we are both HUGE Paula fans. We got the first issue and read it front to back several times. It is an awesome publication filled with recipes and pictures and stories about Paula's life. I think it really captures the feeling of Paula Deens show 
Fido Friendly was a great help in our search to find not just any hotel, but a 4star hotel that more than welcomed our two goldens. The articles are very interesting and fun to read

I picked up a copy of this mag last time I was in the states. I found the articles informative and in-depth. This is not another one of those mags where they review the latest wiz-bang comsumer camera or accessory. It is a magazine for those advanced amateurs looking to develop a better understanding of their craft and thereby improve their skill. I highly recommend giving it a read if you are in this category. 
Invaluable for the do-it-yourself bride who wants a hands-on wedding, or who just wants to save money (don't we all!). From gowns to centerpieces, Martha shows you how to get that expensive designer look without the expensive designer price tags. Her signature taste and elegance are evident in every suggestion. Highly recommen 
I was getting utterly sick of all the other so called "fitness" magazines that were 70% makeup and clothing ads. I found Oxygen and Womens M and i'm hooked on both. You don't see the same old boring exercises just stacked in diffrent routines like the other magazines. You get a lot more variety. And I love the special editions on "butt" and "nutrition" etc 
Obviously "ugly" comments below were written by the uneducated with uneducated guesses and assumptions. I LOVE this magazine. There are awesome workouts, great meals and great stories to inspire one and all. Yes, it does cover fitness/figure competitions, but it doesn't mean everyone has to look like that or get their bodies to that level... it's a magazine for inspiration... to look at the physcially fit (who are only able to look like that when they compete, not 365 days of the year as everyone knows is unhealthy... even those who do compete). yes, the downfall to this magazine is all the supplement advertisements... but what is a magazine without advertisements? Every magazine you look at has some form of adverstisements and since this is technically the "bible" of fitness, there are going to be advertisements tailored to supplements. i will admit, I was somewhat offended by reading what the "ugly" had to say. They must've been jealous, because I felt that way towards fitness like they do when I was in their shoes (I weighed 180 at one point on my 4' 11" frame), or upset because they didn't do the research on this magazine and just assumed it would be another girly magazine with false info on how to lose those last 20 lbs by doing useless no weights exercises or the "as seen on TV" cardio DVDs/exercise machines/gimmicks. Those women are NOT ugly and all are NOT bodybuilders... most were fitness competitors doing gymnastic type routines and only lifting to tone. Weight lifting does not a body builder make. You would have to lift to the extreme, power lift and in the pros take steroids (hence the ugly men-looking women). So... if you want to take your body to the next level... better yet, actually lose some fat in a healthy manner and need some inspiration, please buy a copy of this magazine. check it out. If you're into fitness/figure competitions, well, obviously this is the bible. :) As for the uneducated below, I am competing in my first figure competition in 9 days. Of all the things I have learned through my trainers, most of the supplements you see in the ads are not condoned by them. And contrary to popular belief, we don't all consume protein shakes all day, nor does this magazine say you HAVE to to reach your weight loss goals. And substituting toast with jam for a bagel with cream cheese is just as bad, because you're substituting sugar for fat. Doesn't make any sense. I am one who was overweight and have learned a great deal from magazines like this... every magazine, whether it be fitness, fashion, etc. must be taken with a grain of salt every now and then, because not even the so-called "experts' can agree with what works and what doesn't. Everyone's body is different. Look at this magazine, do the research, make an educated choice 
I love this magazine mainly because I am a figure and fitness competitor. It has great tips. If you are not competitor and just love to workout, this magazine is for you, too! You will get motivated by every article and meal plans! I do not recommend magazine for individuals who are just looking to get toned and not to cut body fat to supreme low levels. Oxygen can at times overly advertise the supplements. I used to get Shape mag but I did not like the models in that mag. They looked way too small to be advertising fitness. I highly recommend this mag for those individuals are INTERSTED IN COMPETITIONS! 
Based on the reviews I read here, I purchased Oxygen and loved it. I signed up for a subscription that day. Two months later I have not received my first issue; but, I have received three "payment due" notices and customer service claims two issues have been mailed out to me. I got tired of waiting and canceled the subscription. I'd rather buy it at the bookstore the day the issue comes out than receive it in the mail 3-4 weeks late 
When the publishers of my all-time favorite women's fitness magazine (Muscle Fitness Hers) decided to stop producing it, I had to find a suitable alternative. While it's not as "meaty" as Muscle Fitness Hers, it's a good, inspiring read. It devotes too much space to fluffy stuff like clothing and makeup (and ug, even a few celebrities), but overall I would recommend it...at least until something better comes along 
this magazine covers four main aspects: physical fitness, food nutrition, health beauty, and mental/spiritual health. it offers something in each and always has new and interesting information that is easy to understand for a person that is just a beginner in the fitness world or experienced. the focus is on physical fitness, and food, and the information is valid and easy to transfer over into everyday life. workouts are easy to understand, with good photos to illustrate, and almost all can be done without making a trip to the gym. i compared this magazine to self, and found this one to be superior in all ways. although self was almost twice as thick, when i counted the pages of usable information that i wanted to pull out and keep (whether for good recipes, work-outs, articles, or products), fitness had over three times the amount of pages than self. it also has a minimal amount of advertising, compared to magazines such as self that seem to be pages of advertising with a little fluff inbetween every once in a while 
This is a good thing. Anything that can keep the folks moving in the right direction is great. I like the idea of seeing people at the top end of the fitness ladder but also want to see those who are doing the best with what they have. A decent magazine is in a perfect place to make it happen because of the on-going exposure 
very interesting magazine about women health 
I am a teacher of students with disabilities and my students absolutely love this magazine. I keep the magazines in my classroom library and the issues of Disney Adventures are constantly being checked out by the students. My students especially enjoy the short articles and comics because it gives them the chance to read, but it isn't too overwhelming 
My 5-year-old loves the magazine. It was easy to order through Amazon. The issues started coming right away 
This magazine is amazing. It has alot of features like interviews, upcoming movies, cheat codes, comics, puzzles, and more things. It also has good color. I started getting them since March, 2002. I still love it 
For $10 a year, at least I can look at a magazine that isn't dominated by SpongeBrand Squarepants or Dora the Commercialized Explorer and that realizes not every parent thinks the Disney Princess pastel hegemony is the only way to go for a nursery. Will I pay $200 for a sweater? Very doubtful, but if I did it would be something I could pass down as an heirloom. True, I may spend more per item on my daughter's clothes and toys than most, but I also limit the number of things she does receive. I'd rather spend $100 on one unique toy I found in Cookie than give her twenty pieces of plastic at $5 a pop from some toy megapolis. Cookie covers quality over quantity, style over branding, modern over mainstream and for that I'm grateful 
Finally a modern parenting magazine! This magazine is great for expectant mothers and mothers with babies or young children. I even enjoy reading it for the information for adults - recommended vacation spots, beauty advice, etc 
Yeah, some of the stuff is way too pricey for me, but there are some really great ideas and articles in this magazine. I have the March-April issue, and among my favorites this month are: an article about how to diplomatically discipline other people's kids, a gifted child who was misdiagnosed with autism, best adult friendly children's music to download, and suggestions for artistic children's books. Furthermore, there is a price range for suggested products, some of which would fit most people's budgets. An article on make-up features products from $8 - $65. There is also an article on how to make a room habitable for 2 children, which is hardly targeted towards people who live in huge estates. Do you buy Vogue magazine and expect to be able to afford everything in it? It's not for some people, but it is for me, and I hope it does well 
I loved this new magazine. It's like Vogue meets Parenting magazine. The ads were beautiful, you cannot dispute that as with all magazines there were way too many. And they had a few great articles... the article about the make a mess birthday party in a backyard with paint and rolls of paper and feathers was really inspiring. I really enjoyed this magazine and look forward to the next issue 
Perhaps this is not the magazine for moms on a tight budget who don't want to even daydream about designer items. But it fills a niche that the big magazines such as Parents or Parenting does not. As a previous reviewer stated, this is similar to InStyle. You may not spend $200 on a pair of designer jenas in size 2T, but it's fun to look at ... and maybe get one in a similar style on sale. And quite frankly, some parents do have the money. Having expensive items does not make a child spoiled. Raising a child to believe s/he is entitled to it does. There are spoiled children across all income levels 
I really enjoyed the first issue. Sure, it is about high end products. However, this mother is happy to find an alternative to pastels and Winnie the Pooh. 
Kerrang! is by far the most informative rock magazine that has ever been published! I can count on Kerrang! to get the best interviews, be up to date, and get the facts straight from the mouths of the musicians. Its a hard to find magazine in the US, but if you can spare the money it is well worth your dollar if your intereseted in the world of hard rock. They also cover a wide range of bands that the US wouldn't even touch, and are always turning you on to new music with free CDs 
This International magazine should be refered to as the Blue-Book of good metal Music... Forget all of those "Boy-Metal" bands like creed or Linkin Pork...They have quality bands like Soulfly, Messhugha, Machine Head, etc... Plus great book, movie, and video game reviews...(if your into that)The only down fall is the $$ Price $$ but, you get your money's worth 
Everything has gone smoothly from the moment I ordered Entertainment Weekly from this seller. It's a pleasure to do business with them and I plan on using them again in the future for my next magazine purchase. 
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY really understands the whole arena of entertainment from film to television to DVD to music to games to even hand-held media for your phone like downloads, mobile ringtones and even book reviews. Plus you can search the archives of Entertainment Weekly for almost any article ranging in categories from Pop Culture to Photo Galleries, to their annual lists which include such top ten lists as the hottest American Idol performances ever, most memorable gay couples even before Brokeback Mountain to the most embarrassing sex scenes in the movies. The magazine has been publishing since 1990 so it has chronicled the rise of the star director, star writer, star-producer and the hyphenates -- actor/producers, actor/directors, actor/writers etc. And it's seen the rise of HOLLYWOOD USA and HOLLYWOOD WORLD where popular culture seems to impact every aspect of our lives from how we live to the clothes we wear to the food we eat to the cars we drive. Don't miss their LISTS -- who's who in various categories like the "IT LIST" to the "POWER LIST" to the "ENTERTAINERS OF THE YEAR". 
Should you try out the hotel hot tub while on vacation or try the pool instead? This magazine has excellent advice for everything from travel concerns to fitness and beauty advice. Recipes for natural salt scrubs with buttermilk mingle with the hottest advice on commercial beauty products. Do the new stick-on manicures work? What is the newest information on cancer prevention? Dr. Andrew Weil has a 5-minute section with holistic-health advice where he explains why Wild Alaskan salmon and blueberries will keep skin youthful. Is the air in your home as clean as it could be? Fun product pages offer seasonal comforts. For summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans. Special sections show you how to lose weight, even when on vacation. Interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin. The only thing in the magazine of concern seems to be the advice section which I read, but take some of her advice with a big pinch of salt. If someone thinks they are suffering from an addiction, they probably are. I'm at times rather surprised by her answers that seem to lean towards a casual approach to serious life-changing situations, although she seems to give women great advice about health issues when it comes to making them feel better about breast cancer or work situations. ~The Rebecca Review 
Health Magazine is a publication that gears its articles toward a wide array of health- related issues and concerns. When I came across a copy for the first time, I picked it up to read with a degree of skepticism. I thought it would be a magazine exclusively about nutrition, but that turned out not to be the case. This magazine does spend some time talking about healthy eating habits, but this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this magazine. The editors of this publication talk about all sorts of health topics, like mental health, relationships, parenting, physical fitness, etc. Because of this, Health has something that will appeal to almost anyone who reads it. This magazine is divided into five main areas: Beauty, Body, Fitness, Mind, and Food. My personal favorites are the Mind and Food sections. I like the Mind area the best because it's the one where I usually find articles that are most relevant to my own health concerns. Here, you can learn about useful things like how to reduce stress in your work and in life, how to deal with problem children, and other informative topics. To a lesser extent, I also like the Food section because it includes some very interesting recipes that show how you can spice up ordinary, routine meals for little cost and minimal effort. If there is one thing to criticize about this publication, it would have to be the fact that it is primarily geared toward women. The Beauty section, for example, is focused almost entirely on feminine concerns, with advice on makeup, eliminating wrinkles, etc. Some of these articles could, of course, be applied toward men but they are mostly centered on woman and the models used in the photos throughout most of the sections of the magazine are female. On the flip side, however, my criticism will prove to be an asset for women, many of whom will find this magazine very useful. Still, in spite of this small criticism, Health is still a very good magazine for all to read. Remember- this is not just a nutrition magazine. The importance of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs comprises only a small part of the publication. The remaining sections of the magazine feature some very useful articles on mental health, relationships, disease control and prevention, healthy cooking, etc., making Health a good publication with articles and columns that anyone can relate to. 
This gem of a magazine covers common sense topics of interest to health concsious readers, primarily young adult women. Feature articles cover topics on "fitness" (body), relationships and feelings ("mind"), "food", and "guidance" on specific health problems. The articles are well written and well researched. It contains delicious easy-to-make healthy recipes, beauty hints, as well as adventurous exercise options. Some examples of great articles in the July-August 2004 issue are, the "hike through history" article, the "one minute moves" and the "water workout" article. The first describes hiking trails in different regions of the country, for instance, "Chesapeake Ohio Canal National Park" in Washington, D.C., "D L Trail (norhtern portion) in Carbon County Pennsylvania, and "Railroad Grade Trail" in Apache Country, Arizona. The second provides a first person account of a very satisfactory exersize program describing aqua yoga, kick-boxing, and circuit training. The "one minute moves" article provides photos and descriptions of very realisitic and doable exersizes for busy people. The food section has photos of farm fresh green beans, cut yellow squash, and sections of colorful bell peppers ... very excellent recipes follow. These foods are easily obtainable from any grocery store. There is also a tasty omelet recipe and some fresh fruit recipes which include melons, cantelopes, and honey dew. Overall, this magazine is highly recommended for women readers of all ages. Erika Borsos (erikab93 
Oftentimes business and econ professors will recommend that there students read the WSJ everyday. That is a terribly waste of time as the Journal is far too longwinded to be of value to busy executives. Businessweek actually provides very quick and incredibly easy-to-read pieces that give you what you absolutely need to know to get a good intuitive feel for trends and news in the business world. The Business Outlook Column by James C. Cooper alone is worth the price of the magazine. Seldom do economist write in such a direct and easy-to-understand style. Furthermore, BW is a great place to pick up ideas on where business has been over the last quarter or so. It is definitely not cutting edge, for that you need to go to daily blogs. However, it is probaly the best print source of business news 
I know the shipping is supposed to take 4 - 6 weeks but it has been nearly 10 weeks and i dont even have one issue in my mail box... they said they mixed up the address though i keep getting other stuff i order perfectly fine to my address. The magazine service should work a lil better. The magazine is a good one but the one star was for the poor service. 
Detailed, useful information - every week. Also well-balanced - not afraid to criticize businesses where appropriate 
There seems to be a great deal of psuedo business magazines. I like the Business Week is hard hitting, and features excellent articles. I always several articles a week in this publication that are worth my time to read. Many publications dummy down business and make it too simple leaving out important details, nuiances that are important, and just assume that the reader isn't intelligent. Articles are written that are concise, generally filled with the data to support their conclusions. I found this magazine invaluable in business school because it kept me up to date, and often ahead of my classmates. In the business world I find that this magazine is one of the few that keep me informed and well rounded with aspects of business I am not familiar with. I really feel this is a worthwhile publication if you are looking to stay on top of what is current and important in the business world. 
Having been a BW subscriber for more than two years, I found BW is one of the best business magazines in the US. It is funny to see some readers accused BW to be biased. Granted, BW criticized many policies of current administration, because they were against long-term growth of the economy. Some of them were pure political manipulations such as steel tariff, those policies will do no one's good. Business is business, for those party-faithfuls who spring to defense anytime their party being criticized regardless the causes, they don't need to read anything intelligent and balanced, Fox News will be suffecient 
Good magazine. I don't get it monthly, but have read through them when I see them. I got one issue and they got good articles and HipHop info them. Good hiphop magazine here 
As someone who reads a lot of magazines and who is a left-liberal, I remain a stalwart supported of The New Republic. This despite the fact that, yes, they supported the Iraq war. Their crucial failing in that enterprise was that they assumed that Bush would work with Democrats, etc., and actually get the job done. It's easy for the anti-war left to bash them after the fact, but at least you can say they take the moral and ethical high road: they've been advocating for military intervention on humanitarian grounds for years, and even if, as in the case for Iraq, they made many mistakes, the fact that they represent an American left willing to intervene on non-self-interested grounds is important in and of itself. Many people have suggested TNR has steadily moved to the right under the tenure of Martin Peretz, but they remain committed to some of the most important issues to American liberals: universal health care, gay rights (their most conservative editor, after all, was Andrew Sullivan, an openly gay Republican) and progressive economics. Jonathan Chait is probably the best political-economics journalist working in the US today. Yes, they are decidedly centrist, and yes, they feature a large number of conservative writers, and finally yes, they are unapologetically pro-Israeli on Middle East issues which puts off the American college left, but their analysis is top notch, their reporting incredibly insightful, and despite no longer being the "in-flight reading of Air Force One," they remain indispensable for anyone wanting to understand the Washington elite. On the arts front they're even more consistent: Stanley Kaufmann's film criticism is insightful and top-notch; I wish they had more of Robert Brustein on the theater, though at least you have to give them credit for being a national magazine which still has a drama desk. Jed Perl is often insufferable in his art criticism, but he's very smart and engaging. Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor, is the one I like least, as he's given to long, wincingly verbose pieces (rarely on books), but he's one of the eminences grise of American literary criticism. More engaging and controversial is James Wood, whose occasional fiction reviews are absolutely worth reading; again, I rarely agree with him, but he's indispensable. Just because you agree with The Believer more doesn't make them more interesting to read. Basically, TNR is great for anyone who's actually interested in what's going on and wants to be intellectually challenged; in the end, I rarely outright agree with their writers, but unlike The Nation or Mother Jones, they don't bother preaching to the choir, and the writing is much better (in the end, I only kept my Nation subscription going for Arthur C. Danto's occasional art pieces). 
I have through the years read many different pieces from the TNR . They almost always were of high quality, credible and convincing. There are exceptions. They not so long back published a piece by Tony Judt on Israel which I found ill- informed and outrageous. In general however they have through the years been fairly understanding of the special dilmenas that Israel faces. Editor Martin Peretz is a strong Israel supporter although he takes a quite dovish Shimon Pereslike line. The book- reviews of TNR are outstanding, a recent example being Robert Alter on Amos Oz masterpiece-memoir " A Tale of Love and Darkness." As for TNR supposed shift from liberal left to neo-con right that would seem to me a quite logical and reasonable response to the changes in American political reality through the years. What seems to me however extremely important is that the pieces in TNR are generally written with a kind of basic decency, and without the overpolemical ugliness of some comparable journals. 
I'm a liberal, and I've been a devoted reader of TNR since the 1950s. And yes it is a liberal magazine. It does excellent investigative work. And I have not noticed much of a change in its politics in the past 50 years. Some of the other readers have mentioned TNR's stand on Israel. This stand has been there since Martin Peretz took over the magazine in 1974. Peretz never supported the right wing in Israel, but he certainly supported Israel's right to exist. And I remember one of his early exposes of Time Magazine for its very one-sided reporting about Israel. In this respect, TNR is very different from The Nation. But does TNR support Democratic candidates? Usually, but not exclusively. TNR did not like Dick Nixon, of course. After Peretz took over, TNR supported Carter for President in 1976. Next, I think it backed John Anderson. Carter's foreign policy obviously started to annoy TNR. TNR always backed Clinton, Gore, and Kerry. And it backed Kerry even though it was a little suspicious of his attitudes about Israel. As for the war in Iraq, TNR initially took Colin Powell at his word about weapons of mass destruction and reluctantly backed the war for this reason, after which it felt cheated. If you want a left wing antizionist magazine, you won't want to even read this. You'll want The Nation. If you want a neoconservative magazine, you'll want to read this, but the magazine you'll really want is the Weekly Standard, or maybe Commentary. Anyway, I always read TNR, and I highly recommend it to everyone 
I was a loyal reader for many years, and I've always been very impressed by their insightful, deep investigations into various scandals and national political events. They _always_ knew more than the newspapers. They've been just excellent, very well-written, and I always felt like they could back up their opinions and their open and earnest political biases right to the 6th level of abstraction, so to speak. Their pursuit of the Objective Truth, whether their target has been Bush or the DNC, has earned my respect. The New Republic kept investigating and muckracking while over the last decade major news institutions have one by one become purveyors of infotainment and pre-digested pablum. My sense is that with media consolidation and various new press liability laws, news sources have become air-tight and we've been getting our news from company PR flacks and lobbyist firms with agendas. In this environment the real investigative work becomes like gold. Middle-brow types read TIME, but the writers at TIME and others who want real knowledge and context on what is happening on the ground all read the New Republic. The magazine has been vastly more influential than it's 100K+ circulation #'s would imply. But..The New Republic was _for_ the War in Iraq, despite their natural antipathy towards Bush, which I share. I haven't read them lately - I'm sure they're appalled at how things have gone over there. The magazine has never been a cluster of soft peaceniks usually associated with the Left, but here I feel like they've let loose their inner Hawks given Bush the benefit of the doubt (always the _wrong_ decision).. So what does that make them..quasi-Neocons? Utopians? Dupes? They're often much too closely focused on Israel, and this also may have clouded their thinking ..along with Colin Powell's great song-and-dance at the U.N. last year. I felt I needed to try something new. Lately I've been reading the New Yorker Reason (it's right-of-center doppelganger) some other magazines, but I still think the New Republic is an excellent source of news and very worthwhile. Definately - you should buy an issue on the news stand try it out 
Though I oftentimes disagree with some of the articles written by The New Republic, I cannot help but keep coming back to this magazine when trying to gain better insight into current affairs. If for anything else , the quality of the writing in this magazine is AMAZING and its reporters obviously conduct painstaking research in writing every nuianced article. The group that writes for TNR are obviously some of the best journalistic writers around and its critique on intellecual matters and popular culture are itself enough reason to purchase a subscription to this magazine (if you don't like its politics). All in all , this is a fine magazine 
Spa Parties and T-shirts that say "Delish" are very much a part of Rachael's magazine complete with pullout recipe cards and travel features. The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine. The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes. Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms. What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze. This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The "Ask Rachael" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1). What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? "What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?" I'm always intrigued. If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting. ~The Rebecca Review 
After buying the first issue of Rachael Ray's new magazine I knew I would have to subscribe after only a few pages. Those pages were not only gorgeous and glossy, but chock full of fun facts, great shopping places for food and utensils, and of course tasty recipes that you do want to make. I have collected way too many cookbooks and food magazines that stand untouched because when it really boils down to it, its all about the food and some of those books and magazines did not deliver in the end. I have since bought some great cookbooks and pay more attention to what's inside then what's on the cover. Rachael's recipes are not pretentious, and they certainly are interesting enough to engage the reader into trying them out. I've made several of the dishes from the Lemon cream pasta, Mushroom pizza, salmon and pasta dishes, to Sangria frozen pops and some great grilled food. Rachel provides shopping lists of standard pantry ingredients and fresh produce to buy, so its easy to see what you all ready have and what few things I can pick up on my way home to make a fun meal. I love making her recipes and adding them to my repertoire, as its nice knowing you can make a certain dish and its even nicer to whip up an easy dinner or lunch using this magazine. I also adore the fun articles you can find about restaurants, cheese diaries, wine tasting, outdoor grilling and foods for events. The magazine is really a beauty to read and has more information and entertainment than advertising. I cant stand the regular food magazine I used to get that were half full of Cat litter advertising, along with page after page of useless products screaming in my face. I hope this magazine will continue to bloom because I absolutely adore it and I intend on keeping every issue instead of tearing out recipes like I used to. Great buy and something you can cook out of with the feeling of a mini cookbook but simpler and prettier 
There is SO much in each issue of Everyday with Rachael Ray! This is really the best food magazine (and so much much more!) in a long time. It's just a shame it isn't every single month : 
I'm usually not one for taking a chance on new magazines (especially if they've been shoved down the public's throats or Oprah Winfrey endorses it) but this is one instance where Oprah gets major-league credit for putting her faith and money in Rachael Ray. I was impressed with the magazine's layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - and the recipes contained within are delicious and easy to prepare (and you won't go searching every speciality shop in the country for the ingredients, either). I also like how Rachael let readers in on her Italian wedding and African safari honeymoon. Unlike other celebrities, she didn't let us know too much information (thank you!) and I'm sure her recommendations of trattorias, cafes, and hotels in Tuscany are worth the time and easy on the budget. Just because she doesn't have initials besides her name and a culinary degree (she's not the only one on The Food Network lacking this!), Rachael spent her whole life in restaurants and with food and she learned the same tricks of the trade that the fusion chefs on the Network know. This is definitely worth a look at and I'm seriously considering ordering a subscription. 
The magazine was passed on to me by someone after she finished with it. I subscribe to 2 other cooking magazines and I have to say Rachael beats them both by miles! Her meals are easy but also interesting, her writing style is fun and the weekly planner is a great idea. I will definitely subscribe! (and let my other 2 subscriptions lapse 
I am a huge fan of cooking magazines and when this glossy mag hit the stands a few months ago, I picked up a copy immediately. At the time, I wasn't too familiar with Rachael Ray as I had never seen her cooking program. But since Everyday found its way into my hands, I have become a not so secret Ray fan. The premiere issue was amazing - I read it from back to front and was pretty impressed with the content - recipes, ideas and food stories. Of course, I had to try the recipes to see if they were any good - and wow - I was truly amazed at the quality and variety. From this issue alone, I made Ginger Salmon, Overstuffed Chicken Pitas, Greek Style Tuna Salads, Posole (I was always looking for a good recipe for this - and this is the best one I have come across not to mention easy), Beef Wellingtons (simple) Chicken Curry (my son says this is the best chicken curry he has ever had) and more! Some of the recipes are from her many books, but there is lots of new stuff here as well. I really like the dessert recipes by contributor Silvana Nardone. Other cooks are featured here as well - so this is not strictly a "Rachael Ray" magazine. Every issue comes with a handy 'mini cookbook' complete with grocery list - you can take this right out of the book and bring it to the store. Talk about convenient and clever! Wow! It boasts a week of 30 minute meals. Very nice for the busy home cook. I also enjoyed the travel/food stories. In this issue, Rachael shares her favorite New York spots. As I am planning a journey to New York this spring, I will certainly have to investigate a few of her recommendations. Overall, I am seriously impressed with this magazine - great content, supremely easy recipes, good variety, lots of pictures, nice layout and a sense of fun that is absent in many of the other cooking magazines. I ordered a subscription and the second issue was just as amazing! I recommend this magazine to everyone who loves to cook - not just those looking for cooking in a flash. I'd give this magazine 10 stars if I could 
I think there can be no better magazine value of its type. I have particularly enjoyed the recipe section, but it is all good. Why didn't somebody tell me? 
If I had to pick just one women's magazine to subscribe to, "Good Housekeeping" would be the one. It has many of the same articles that all women's magazines have: articles on health, fitness, finance, relationships, diet, beauty, and fashion. But "Good Housekeeping" goes beyond the surface in these articles, for example, their fashion articles don't focus just on high-priced clothing, instead they show outfits that look like their expensive counterparts that readers can buy for just a fraction of the cost. There are also advice columnists on things like household hints, etiquette, and relationships. Each issue also has a short story. There's also the seemingly obligatory celebrity on the cover and interview inside each issue. What I like about "Good Housekeeping" are the in-depth articles. Most magazines today publish articles that are only a page or so long, but many articles in "Good Housekeeping" are several pages long. The articles are often about ordinary people making a difference in the world. There are usually cautionary articles for parents with young children and/or teenagers that can be frightening (a recent article was about a sexually abusive male babysitter) but very useful. As with many magazines, Good Housekeeping also has an on-line counterpart, where readers can post messages about current issues as well as enter contests. Well worth subscribing to. 
I have received "ladies'magazines" for many years and keep coming back to GH. I am 57, single, have little reading time for pleasure and little interest in or time for walking through stores to keep up with products, new ideas, etc for women. I don't' even spend much time on the net for this information. I like GH's reputation for quality (GH Seal of Approval and assessment of products), the price (it requires ads to sell the magazine at this low price in today's market; GH passes some on to the customer by keeping the subscription cost low), and the timeliness and the variety of topics interesting women. And I enjoy the tidbits of celebrity information without excessively intimate details of their personal lives that have no impact on the reason I enjoy their performances/talent. It's the only "overall" magazine of this kind that addresses things I want to know about on a consistent basis without becoming the same every month, which is something I don't like about many other periodicals. I also enjoy the ads; otherwise, I would never know of foods, beauty aids, cooking techniques and equipment, fashions, shoes, books, etc. I look forward to getting my GH. When topics greatly interest me, I cut and file them. Also, when I finish with one while flying, I can always find another woman who is happy to take it on their flight. As some of the youngsters say today, "It's all good! 
Ok, so you wrote in forever ago and will probably not see this... Size 8-16 in USA clothing is equivalent to about size 16-32 in the UK. As you can see, this magazine targets the average American woman 
Great Conservative political journalism. Would've liked to read it when William Buckley was editor 
I love how they focus on a particular region and give background on the food and the people. I am still drooling over their visit to Ireland's famed dairy region. I must get my hands on some of that butter. It seems as if, the writers took the time to get to know the people and infuse their personalities into the recipes 
Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials. While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills. After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard. Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine. ~The Rebecca Review 
SAVEUR has been a guilty pleasure for me for some time. Guilty because it is hard to take serious a magazine with such a hoity sounding name... and admittedly some of the travel-and-food stories are just on the edge of self-indulgent, self-concious behaviour. They laugh at me at home (or used to) for reading it. What makes it good is the content. The cover story each issue is usually a "destination" article, focused on a particular area and its food (cuisine is the wrong word here), written in a personal vein, with beautiful photos, and this is the heart of the magazine. But the other content is equally beautiful and it is amazing how many of the recipes actually are useful and have become mainstays for me... not just something good looking. Hide the cover if you must, but I think this is the best "foodie" magazine 
Delicious recipes, color photos, travel background, ingredients sources, well written articles and the ads are not designed to make you rip the magazine apart like a certain 'no ads' magazine. Sometimes the contributing authors are a little full of themselves, but overall the writing is excellent and the food is authentic to the region being written about. Its a touch expensive direct from Saveur, but a good deal on Amazon 
I love this magazine because it gives the background and history of food. When I get the magazine each month,I have to read it right then and there. I finally found out where Salisbury Steak originated. In Ohio, by a doctor during the Civil War. Not in England. The photography is beautiful and some of the stories are memories of what the certain food means to them. They make you want to try everything in the magazine. Saveur is not pretentious as "Food and Wine" or "Gourmet." It is nice to read about regular people that make great food at reasonable expenses. Subscribe to this magazine 
This journal is a great resource for readers who are serious about their dogs. Articles are usually scientifically-researched and include health, training, and behavior issues. There are occasional reviews of dog-friendly products as well. This journal is well worth the money. Those who prefer holistic medicine may want to balance this subscription with a subscription to "Whole Dog Journal." 
I absolutely LOVE this magazine. It not only has tons of helfpul fitness tips, but it does not require you be a size 2. The Self Fitness Challenge is my favorite part of the year. 
I just recently decided to subscribe to this mag. and that was only based on the low price. But it has really suprised me and I totally enjoy this magazine. It is definately my new favorite. Its got a lot of informative articles, unless other mags of its kind that don't have much reading in them 
Great articles on women's health issues. Very up-to-date and helpful information. Easy to follow workout programs. This magazine is exactly what I've been looking for 
I have been a faithful subscriber for approximately 10 years. This is the magazine that impatiently wait for every month. It has beauty tips, interesting articles, fitness information, etc. I even gave my mother a gift subscription. It's the best 
Today I received the first issue - April 2006 issue. I found it AMAZING and INFORMATIVE resource for body, mind and soul practices toward healthier life.. The most thing I liked about this magazine is that it respects religions. It provides accurate information from various religions to help people of other believes improve their lives. (Relying to what I read until now in this issue

This magazine is, in my opinion, well thought out. The articles are interesting, relevant and well-written. Good photography. Quality paper. I enjoy reading it and look forward to reading it. Of all the magazines in our waiting room, more patients have had positive remarks on this magazine than any other. I just re-subscribed for my second year and quite pleased. Highly recommend. 
I have been reading this magazine for 3 years now and find it continually creative and insightful. The articles cover a broad range of physical and spiritual topics with clear subject matter. I highly recommend this for any age group. There is nothing offensive or patronizing. I was hooked after one month. 
Spirituality and Health is a bi-monthly magazine that reports on the ideas, the people, and the practices of the current spiritual renaissance. Featuring reviews of books, DVD's, and music, as well as lively columns and interviews, Spiritual and Health Magazine explores the mind/body connection, healing, spiritual practice, science, psychology, and more. Here is a sample of some of the articles featured in this magazine: *Socrates' Seven Spiritual Principles *The Healing Power of Doing Good: The New Science of Volunteering *The Standford Forgivness Project *Qi Vs. Cancer *Lessons From Mindful Corporations. *Recovering From Infidelity *Classic Hymns Cut Through Dementia *Spiritual Literacy in Wartime *How Plants May Explain the Intelligence of Ants Magazine departments include book and movie reviews, gorgeous art and photographic galleries, beliefs from all walks of life and faiths, commentary by Thomas Moore, and more. One of my favorite sections is What Goes On In There, Really? which examines different worship practices. They have profiled experiences like a Pentecostal Christian service, Dances of Universal Peace, Maundy Thursday in Baghdad, Friday Night Shabbat Service, Siddha Yoga Meditation Ashram, and Spotting Elves in Iceland. I've been a subscriber for several years now, and once I sit down to begin reading Spiritual and Health Magazine, it's hard to get up! You never feel like you're preached at; rather, this magazine offers gentle observations on contemporary culture, ancient wisdom, science, healing, personal growth, new discoveries, and spirituality--with breathtaking color photographs placed throughout. This magazine is truly a visual feast, as well as food for the soul 
We've been getting Discover for about a year from someone who gave my children a subscription (but we can't recall from whom). That sub was nearly ended, so when my 13-year-old son said it's his favorite magazine, I bought him a new subscription for his 14th birthday 
The magazine provides its readers with immediate access to startling developments in science, technology and medicine with a renewed emphasis on how those breakthroughs affect their world. The world is evolving faster than ever. New technologies are influencing every aspect of our lives. An award-winning, general interest magazine devoted to the world of science and technology.For three out of my four years in high school, I kept up with Discover. It allowed me to be geeky without overstressing my brain on very technical, field-specific jargon that I'd find in journals like Scientific American. I learned a lot from that magazine. I learned such and such, and my best guess is from Discover. I usually don't retain fine details, but the pull quotes and headlines from that magazine stick with me.Discover is my science magazine of choice. Look for subscription deals and you'll be a happy geek like me, too. 
What can I say? I subscribed to a magazine and now it's arriving. 
I love Discover. Every month it keeps me informed on the #1 reason for optimism about this human race. Scientific, technological progress. Which vanquished disease, poverty and starvation in most of the world and delivered here and now what religion only promised later. It's a good magazine. The main short-coming would be that it tends to be short on text sometimes and long on glossy often irrelevant and insipid photos and graphics. I would prefer a text-only magazine to the pointless illustrations that devour so much of the magazine's real estate. But one must get used to such a thing, to enjoy any modern magazine. TIME magazine got dumbed-down, too, along with most of the others. And for $20 ya can't beat this with a stick. 
We have previously viewed this outstanding magazine and decided to purchase it as a gift for our son. We are disappointed that, although we purchased it in February, he will have to wait until May or June to receive his first copy. We hoped that he would receive the winter issue since it was already in publication. We know he will enjoy the publication but it is hard to encourage that excitement when there is nothing available to show him since we could not find an issue to give him, only a note to explain the coming issues. 
This magazine compares favorably to "American Heritage" with its interesting and accessible but well-researched accounts of the past. Each issue focuses on a person (I just read the story of Thomas Aquinas--and hadn't realized his fascinating interaction with Muslims) or a movement (The Huguenots, who's sad history led to their dispersal from France to all over the world--including the Revere family moving to Massachusetts). All in all, an intriguing glimpse at how Christians of the past continue to influence us today 
As a long-time IT professional, I've read InfoWorld, Information Weekly, SysAdmin, Dr Dobbs, etc. etc. In 2006, the only one I read with any regularity is Computerworld. It is relevant, smart, and covers an almost impossible range of topics in a very broad IT world. Of late, they've been doing single-page overviews of new technology (with basic definitions) intended to get you up to speed on a buzzword or technology, and point you in the right direction for more information. They have excellent columnists on the whole (I can do without Curt Monash's DBMS theories) and some amazing reporters. There's hardly a week that doesn't bring me something new to learn or consider. Rounding out its better aspects is the sections closer to the front, containing shorter articles and snippets that often lead to more reading on my part, all good pointers. Finally, there's the Shark Tank, the back page column that lists dumb things in IT (think Dilbert's daily routine). My biggest problem has to do with the Editor-in-Chief. I hardly ever agree with Don Tennant's editorials, and think he's more of a China apologist than anything else. Still, his magazine is a very good one, and worth reading for anyone in the IT industry who needs a really good view of what's going on today. I can tolerate his dumb opinions, so long as the rest of the magazine remains so good. -Fre 
With its weekly distribution, there is almost too much information. Articles are balanced and cover a wide range of topics. Quickly responds with articles about new concepts and ideas 
I love this magazine because it keeps me up on celebrity gossip, and it lets me know what to wear, where to get it, and where to get it cheaper! I wish that a subscription wasn't so much $ though. I used to pick one up at the grocery store once a month, but they don't sell it in my new state (just moved). I'll keep looking 
The Writer is the best of the four magazines on writing I have read over the past couple years. The quality of articles, the focus on the writing craft is superior to others that are available in the market. I look forward to each issue arriving in my mailbox 
I have reviewed two issues so far. The articles are practacal and challenging. Well worth the investment for someone working on a manuscript 
The Writer is one of my favorite mags, and I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox. It's packed with "how to" articles on fiction writing and poetry. There are also interviews, book reviews, and stuff on literary journals. There are a lot of writing magazines out there, I've subscribed to all of them, but this one is the best. You won't be disappointed. Also recommended: Writer's Digest, The Sun and The Gospel of Arni 
I've been a freelance writer since 1996, and every month I look forward to reading the next issue of The Writer. It's a magazine that shows you how to write better, how to get published, and how to stay inspired. The interviews with top writers are great, and I love the reviews of books about writing. The hour or so I spend reading each issue is among the best time I ever spend. If you're a writer, you should subscribe immediately 
it's a great way to keep in touch with the culture, language and general issues that affect women in German 
This magazine is very good for the novice to medium level computer user. Recommended for sure 
A fun read encompassing nearly every important facet of the PC with an emphasis on performance and gaming. Yes the information they provide can be found on the internet, but the simplicity and no-nonsense approach of their reviews makes getting the information a pleasure rather than an arduous task leading to more questions than answers 
I'v been taking this mag since it was called Boot. It still has the best overall info for builders, but they are starting to get a little trendy in their pages. 
The best magazine available for PC enthusiasts, very good info on overclocking, system optimizing, OS tweaks and excellent hardware and software reviews, I look forward to each issue 
This is by far the best PC magazine I have ever owned. It provides great reviews of the latest products out on the market. Before building your PC make sure you check this magazine first. I love the layout and the great looking design. I highly recommend this magazine 
ART IN AMERICA seems to have won the vote for most popular periodical on the arts. The quality of reporting of world events, the informed writers who critique and investigate, and the style of referencing used in the articles makes this magazine immensely readable. This is not the most sophisticated journal of art (MODERN PAINTERS and some of the other European magazines win there), but the balance between coverage of reviews in America as well as the international scene is very fine. Ads are well designed and reproduced - even if there are a few too many for 'vanity spaces'. The constant for all of the available art magazines that can stand as a complaint is the overemphasis on New York gallery reviews: New York is not the hub it once was and the importance of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, etc is not recognized by the writers/editors.The exhibitions reviewed are solid in reportage, if unduly weighted to the edgy installation and quirky art. But for the August Issues of the Gallery Guide this magazine has them all topped! 
Just about the best art magazine available now, even the advertisements are interesting. Global view of what is happening in the art scene today 
I have been listening to christian metal since the early days. Back when all there was to listen to was Stryper and a few others. Since there was no internet back then we needed HM to bring the info to us. If it wasn't for Doug Van Pelt the faithful would have been lost. I remember waiting on the edge of my seat for the next issue to come. If you listen to christian music, get this mag. It's the bible of christian metal!! 
Whether you are into hard music or not, whether you are a Christian or not, there is plenty of good stuff carefully invested in each page of HM magazine. The news keeps you on your toes with pointers that you actually care about. There is a notably diverse range of music covered, with a special emphasis on hard music and indie music-- "Christian" bands, mind you (whatever that means now days...) Interviews are anything but standard, and far from dull. Reviews are constructive, insightful and informative... very useful for selecting cds. There are helpful tips for guitarists and drummers, and they review gear too. For those of us who are Christian (yes I am one,) there is some great down to earth advice in the last columns on all things relevant. However, one must be interested in at least one of these two things: 1. Good music 2. Christianity. Otherwise, this zine is probably not for you. Anyhow, find out for yourself 
I have been reading this magazine for years. I love the tips and enjoy looking at what is "fashionable" at the time. I recommend this magazine! 
I tend to buy a lot of fashion and beauty magazines, and immensely enjoy reading them when I have time to relax and forget about my intense and demanding job. I do believe that InStyle is the best one, for me anyway. My favorite feature is the "Great at Any Age" where they discuss a clothing or beauty option and they present how it can look best on women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. I don't know of ANY other magazine that does that so well. I just canceled my Lucky subscription because I was so tired of seeing ONLY clothes that look great on 20 year olds. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against 20s, but a magazine needs to show a RANGE to be useful. InStyle magazine covers fashion and beauty very well, and is full of great tips and information for *everyone. 
I'm a bit of a magazine junkie and subscribe to about 15 different magazines (and slowly reviewing them all). In Style is DEFINITELY my favorite FASHION magazine. It doesn't give advice on how to pleasure your man but they do have a few fun articles on celebrities and fashion-related news. The styles they show are so versatile and easy to assemble yourself in real life. In Style offers alternatives to super expensive clothing by categoring some pieces in $, $$, and $$$. I love it because I can afford 80% of the fashion they show, whereas Elle, Vogue, and W are all a little bit "over" my taste. To me, In Style is more affordable and easier to relate to on an everyday basis. If you do enjoy high fashion and $1000 purses, you should probably look elsewhere. In Style offers a healthy dose of celebrity fashion that I need every month, and I really, do do do love this magazine 
Love the recipes, love everything inside. I'm a foodie and this magazine is a monthly food for my soul. : 
I love the look of this magazine. -Such high quality. The overwhelming amounts of advertisements can be a bit much though. The photography and style is fantastic. They some how make everything from vases to flowers to all foods look compelling and beautiful 
Long time MSL subscriber. I get out my dec, dec/jan issues every holiday season to see what works for ornaments and decorations and such. I loved the cookie issue last year, definite keeper. Her projects involve time and materials, but you end up with something that will last, and instructions are generally very clear. I've seen that since her trial/jail, the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out, which means adds for average joes, like me. I really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject, even if its not a particular fave of mine. I haven't really watched the Martha show much, I really enjoyed the original MSL show she started with. Sometimes I get annoyed that the materials seem very exclusive to New York and similiar, but c'est la vie 
I'm kind of a homebody -- I love making things, sewing and cooking, and making my home as nice as possible for myself, my kids, and my guests. When I found this magazine, it was love at first sight: crafts, easy sewing projects, home-made decorations and beautifully photographed meals, all in one spectacularly well-put-together magazine. To be honest, I always loved Martha's work but could never stand her show; now I can have all that her show offers (and more) without having to be annoyed by a tv programme. I highly recommend this magazine if what you're looking for is a source of inspiration for home projects, rife with easy -- and mostly quick -- crafts and decorations. I would almost recommend this even if you only buy it for the photographs. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because, as another reviewer mentioned, it is loaded with ads. That's my only complaint 
I've been a subscriber for many years. Martha's magazine is always filled with beautiful images and great-looking recipes. her suggestions for housekeeping, gardening, and decorating are always tasteful and useful. I particularly like her holiday recipe selections. My main complaint about her magazine are the recipes. The food looks great, but the recipes I've made are fairly on the bland side and overcomplicated. I immediately pass over recipes with ingredients I cannot find in the supermarket or recipes which require 7-10 eggs and endless beating. I have come to the conclusion that I prefer recipes which are spicier than Martha does and desserts which are less frou frou. In fact, I prefer her FOOD magazine for recipes. 4 stars. I'm a lifetime subscriber, but I wish the recipes were a little more to my taste. They seem geared more toward goumand foodies than your average joe 
From a girls perspective this is a great magazine. I also subscribe to some "harder" adult magazines but I definitly still love this one. Great and interesting articles, nice ads and very sexy pictures 
I like Playboy because it offers almost everything a man may want in a tasteful, entertaining and informative magazine. Of course, the accent is on gorgeous women who are tastefully exposed but not completely because it is always nice to have a little bit left to the imagination. The models are exceptional women issue after issue and Playboy delivers again and again. There are questions with celebrity persons and editorials, the humoristic par is also captivating. There is even political commentary. However, the most memorable part are the top quality photos throughout the content and after I turned from average into a great lover thanks to the bestseller scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex, I am even confident enough to hang out with girls out of my usual league. After all, it is nice to watch hot girls at the pages but it is also good to do something to hang out with such. Overall, Playboy offers a lot to young and older men with various interests and demands, and I am sure that you will enjoy your subscription. They also add spicy bonuses so don't be very surprised if you get also a DVD or something. Enjoy 
Playboy magazine, while luring people to open the cover with promises of female flesh, consistently has excellent articles focusing on issues of civil rights, civil liberties, and the defense of them all. Trancending partisanship, Playboy is a beacon of stewardship over the rights we all take for granted daily. And the pictures are nice 
I believe that every American man owes it to himself to subscribe to this magazine at least once in his lifetime. To feel the sense of entitlement that comes along with regular deliveries of hot naked women to one's mailbox is a true sense of prosperity, freedom, and manhood not to be missed. God bless America, and may God bless Playboy Magazine 
I have been reading Playboy for years and have always felt this magizine has grown with informative information,and of course the great pictures have always been top notch. I cannot think of a better magazine to subscribe to..... 
Who hasn't heard of Playboy? Well, there are many reasons for that. Hugh Hefner's vision for what really matters for a man and how to make sure that you'll have some good time and fun is still unsurpassed. I guess that most men are drawn to the exclusive and high quality photos of usually gorgeous women who are tastefully exposed but not completely. I love this element of teasing and keeping part of them uncovered so you can spice up the entertainment and experience with your fantasies. Apart from the soft-core nudity, Playboy is also an excellent source of interesting information. Each issue has movie and music reviews as well as a short story and objective political commentary. The magazine has humorous parts, editorial, and fascinating news. There is also a 20 Questions feature with a celebrity and a long interview with another famous figure. Overall I am sure that you will love it and have a great time reading each issue. The bestseller "Scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" is additional must read about women and sex. I highly recommend both of them 
For over fifty years Hugh Hefner has beaten his critics with a very diverse magazine. Beyond great pictures, Playboy has been a leader in fighting for rights that we so often take for granted. Whether defending what consulting adults do in private, or how to worship or not to as we please. Mr. Hefner has been there without the extremes of the ACLU. It also has timely articles on law, science, sports, arts and entertainment. The women in Playboy are more sensual than in Maxim or FHM. Who often just have the revolving flavor of the month girl. Mr. Hefners creation has outclassed and outlasted its competition for a reason. I deduct 1 star because, blonds {usually out of a bottle} are overepresented than their actual % of our population. Mr. Hefner, please bring on more Oriental and Mediteranean goddesses. Like Kelly Hu and Vanessa Marcil. 
Playboy has always been classic to me. I know it sounds clique to say but they do have GREAT articles and the spreads of the women are tasteful. I will continue to enjoy playboy for years to come 
Playboy still has it; it's not just a magazine for men any more. This magazine has it all, articles, jokes, stories, and of course gorgeous woman! Unlike most adult magazines this one has class; it doesn't show extreme acts nor excessive nudity. It does what it needs to with as little as possible. You get mostly articles, and interviews with few images but the images you do get are great. This is one magazine you don't have to hide from your significant other, unless of course they are the jealous type. Why? Because woman seem to enjoy it just as much as men. Hell the woman in it are gorgeous and very sexy but they aren't shown in a un-classy manner, they are shown as woman should be shown; goddesses. I believe if you don't have a subscription to this you should get one, and if you have a girlfriend let her read it too. It isn't just about sexy woman, its about the world and life itself. It depicts what we as Americans love, freedom. Of course naked ladies don't hurt. -Da 
...if it were for heterosexuals. Playboy is a multidimensional and lively magazine for men. It addresses all areas of male life including technology, work, hobbies, and sports. Yes, sex is included, both in word and pictorial, but, clearly, Playboy is not smut. There's nothing dirty about it. Nude women appear on a small number of its pages contents, and they are far most innocently portrayed than you'll find just about anywhere else on the internet. Nowadays, the culture bar has been set so low that the idea of nude women, appearing alone in a frame, being regarded as pornography seems rather quaint. Honestly, there is no exploitation to be found in any of their exposes. The girls are an immediate justification of evolutionary psychology as they are mature but at the height of physical fertility. They are hypnotic to view. The articles, which are admittedly the clichd excuse for reading Playboy, are, in fact, extremely underrated. Many of them are focused and educational. The only reason that I don't give it five stars is due to the fact that I am not a member of the Democratic party, and I feel that Playboy has an ideological agenda that it expresses far too often. This past issue had a slanted interview with a Democratic advisor and an article by Arthur Schlesinger which was highly biased. I really think this is inappropriate because a lifestyle magazine should not shove politics down one's throat. Furthermore, such an ideological vantage point is absurd given that the editors' real enemies are not "theocrats," but are the male-hating bully boys of political correctness. None of these shrill social critics can be found are on the right. They spread misandry from perches in the media and from womyn's studies programs that terrorize our universities. A publication like this, to have any engagement or importance, must recognize, battle, and ridicule political correctness wherever it is found. 
After checking the exorbitant prices of foreign magazines and Billboard Magazine I love my suscription to Rolling Stone Magazine. Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with the good folks that say that too many uneventful acts are being given undue praise. And yes, obviously it is not the same magazine of yesteryears. I do recognize the fact that times are indeed changing all the time and Rolling Stone has changed as well. But seriously folks, where else you are going to find the awesome deal of a Rolling Stone suscription? Talk about affordable to the masses. Yes, I checked the prices for Uncut, Mojo, Melody Maker? (or something like that) and the prices were downright ridiculous. Not everyone has the inclination to dish out $9-$12 dollars for a sucription. Oh yes, the English have the edge, their magazines are sooo vital, no air between the ears type music journalism, more and more accolades for them and abuse and criticism for Rolling Stone. I agree some of their reviews such as James Brown's "Live at the Apollo" making it a 5 star album is just not so and I bought it for the review. All these Hip-Hop taking center stage, all these blank acts that have yet to make their mark, but hey, you know what? It informs you, it lets you know what is going on out there and once in a while some serious journalism is to be enjoyed. All the politics pisses me off but some of the more dark essays sometimes grab my attention, but here is the grabber: For the same price of the ridiculous expensive imported magazines you can buy a lifetime suscription from Rolling Stones! I mean, till the day you cross the treshold and all the earthly subjects will no longer have any bearing in the state of things. If you are 20 that is 40, 50, 60 years of delivery to your door. What does that break down to? Actually and I am no Mathematician but I am sure it breaks down to Zero for an all American Music Magazine. Take your criticism overseas because Rolling Stone is a great buy any way you slice it and you can take that to the bank. Some awesome reporters have graced the covers of this magazine so do not give me any flak and some great articles too! Boo Whoo, Boo Whoo, Rolling Stone is a great buy, now what? 
No other magazine I'm aware of gets more undeserved criticism than RollingStone. The writing is supurb. I don't know why everyone assumes pop culture magazines must all be sensationalist rags in the same vein as Teen Beat. Complaining that too many talentless teen icons are put on the cover is pointless--it is after all a magazine that delves into POP CULTURE. Not liking the subject matter isn't just cause to criticize. The record review section is the best of any music mag. It's 100% idiotic to assume their reviews are bogus just because some band or group that you wouldn't ever consider listening to anyway got a "good" rating. The beauty of their reviews is that they pander neither to music elitists nor so-called "teeny-boppers," and their reviewers are smart enough to be able to differentiate between what makes good pop music and what makes good experimental music. RollingStone is NOT a specialty magazine that's going to say a certain type of music is great and another type is crap. It is just a music and pop culture mag, and a damn good one 
I have just read an interview on 'The American Spectator 'in which the journalist Charley Levine interviews Jonathan Pollard. Polland explains the unusual harshness of his jail sentence, and its injustice. I think it is quite commendable that the 'Spectator' prints such an interview. The Spectator counts among its contributors P.David Hornik one of the finest political writers working today. It has a political line which I generally sympathize with. It is a friend, and even if at times is not at the highest of highest quality it is certainly superior to most of the opposition 
American Spectator Mag. is an Oasis of true conservatism in this jungle of Liberalism! Mr. Emitt Tyrell has got to be THE coolest guy to ever put together a magazine. The information is fantastic, the intellect captivating. I highly reccommend it to everyone 
The American Spectator offers an eloquent and often humorous conservative viewpoint on the more pressing political and cultural issues facing the world today. The emphasis here is "conservatism", not "Republicanism" as TAS is often highly critical of GOP politics and policies that stray from conservative ideals. Publications like TAS counter the insidious, tendentious underpinings of the mainstream media, hollywood, and the mistake that is the United Nations. I recommend you at least give it a look. Samples of its content can be found at www.spectator.or 
I read Successful Farming, Progressive Farming and Backwoods Home for years. They are all fine magazines. But if you want to do a little hobby farm this magazine really fits. They have a wealth of information in each copy. I'm really impressed. It's really targeted to those people who have five to thirty acres, a few animals and may or may not want to make a little money on this side or as minimum have fun but do it the right way. My first copy was their tractor issue. Very good info. And I'm an engineer 
This magazine is my dream magazine. I subscribed to it immediately after reading a few articles while my parents were shopping at the tractor supply store. It has quite a few useful articles covering everything from animal health to hoof trimming, to special breed information and generators. I think it's a must for anyone who has ever been interested in farming or ranching, or just getting back to the country life 
My husband and I have bought the past 2 issues of Hobby Farms, and we really enjoy it! It always has articles about organic methods for gardening, interesting information about animals you might not have considered (this month, Dairy Sheep!), equipment for use on the small farm, and a variety of other useful bits of information. Similar to magazines like OG &amp; Mother Earth News, but more focused on specific information for "back to the farm" individuals and lots more info on animals instead of just gardening. It has fewer ads than most magazines, but the ads are still there... but at least they're grouped next to articles that have a similar topic 
I started reading the Economist after a recommendation from a professor during my undergrad years. That was 9 years ago. Reason blended with wit and intelligence, the articles in the Economist are a perfect antidote to the often insipid stuff put out by conventional newspapers. Once I get my weekly edition, you couldn't blow-torch it out of my hands (my wife has tried). The Economist is one of the few newspapers that has consistently defended the classical liberal perspective. Free markets, civil liberties, and skepticism of those in power. In my opinion, it has no competitors. I couldn't rate it highly enough 
I live internationally and have been reading The Economist every week since the 1997 Asian crisis and it's probably my most productive habit. I read it pretty much cover to cover most weeks and that takes a good 2-3 hours. I massacre it during the week, roll it up, squeeze it into my handbag and rip pages out to take with me to any place I am potentially going to be bored. Reading The Economist makes you smarter. I am not kidding or craven. It does it by: - Improving your reading skills, and reading makes you smarter. It uses the language really well. It makes it easier for you to read harder things with quicker comprehension. - Affecting your writing style - you find their writing style stays in your head and affects the way you write. - It introduces you to wonderful books and encourages reading through their references and opinions - you eventually get around to thinking 'I should really check that book out to see what the fuss is about'. Discussions and reviews in The Economist got me reading Adam Smith, Charles Darwin and Proust among a wide range of others. You learn from books like these and learning makes you smarter. It puts the daily news you get into a context. I remember feeling total frustration during the Bosnian war. I saw the news everyday - but I never understood the overall story - what was behind it? You heard that it was historical and "there's always trouble in the Balkans" like that was enough of an explaination for that kind of horror. Now, after almost 10 years of reading The Economist, when I watch the news I am more aware of the context - the background story and how these events might fit in. It's an enjoyable read - absorbing and occasionally very funny. There a few things more geeky than bursting out laughing while reading The Economist - but unexpected laughter is a good thing! The Christmas issue has lots of additional quirky articles - e.g. on Barbie Torture by small boys (my brother did that!). The Economist is liberal in the proper sense in that it supports the rights and responsibilities of the individual, small government/low taxes, and pragmatism. So you find it supports ; - Legal and safe contraception and abortion. I am currently pregnant and very aware that given how hard it is, it's for volunteers. - Ending the prohibition on drugs to be consistent with personal freedom, deal with the health issues, and reduce the source of funding to crime and terrorism. - Letting people's own choice and not the choice of the majority, determine who they marry. - Free trade as the most effective method of poverty reduction the world has ever had access to. The Economist is for people who have a craving for reality. It's for grownups. 
This is how Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, described his impression of the magazine. Although a little overhyped, I could'nt put it more succintly. It makes you think and makes you laugh. Read it 
This is not solely a magazine for financial news. Writers from various points of view give the reader a great depth of research in their reporting. Precise coverage on current events, science, law, medicine, economics, politics, and technological news that you will not find anywhere else. I would say the thrust of the magazine is "libertarian light." It is simply the best news source in the English speaking world 
I could not carry on with life as I know it without the Economist. No hype. It's that good. This American reviewer became hopelessly addicted to the Economist's news and analysis during four years in England. The magazine - or 'newspaper', as it stubbornly insists on calling itself - is published from London, though as of 2005 the largest national readership is in the United States. The editorial line is libertarian in the more moderate European sense of the word. The essential values are individual liberty, a modest state, and free market economics. Don't let the name fool you. This weekly is far more than an economist's rag. Its anonymous writing on current events if fabulous, not to mention top-ranked analysis of letters, arts, and the like. Let me give you a concrete example of how the Economist excels. For years, I have paid close attention to its coverage of Latino and immigration issues in the USA. One might suppose that a British magazine would be at a disadvantage when exploring this complex topic, yet the Economist's coverage routinely surpasses that of US newspapers and magazines, perhaps largely because of its disdain for self-suppressing 'PC' tactics. The only area in which I detect broad deficiency in this magazine's coverage is in the role of religion, particularly in America. The secularist European spectacles its editors wear seem to make it impossible for them to canvass this phenomenon with a view that religion's continued fervor in advanced Western nations is something other than retrograde and slightly amusing. I tell my university-age nephews - thankfully, they ask - to anchor their news consumption in one weekly, then to read widely beyond it. The Economist is the very best anchor available to English-reading sailors 
I've subscribed to Cooking Light for about 5 yrs now. Here are the things I like: 90% of the recipes are very good, many absolutely fabulous. It gives you all nutritional information so when I'm on weight watchers I can easily convert it to points. Most ingredients are simple that I can find at a regular grocery store and I don't have to go to some specialty food store to find it 
After 14 days in Italy with nothing but Pizza-Pasta, Pasta-Pizza, thang God for this magazine jam packed with lovely light and lightening recipes and ideas. This mag is a blessing 
I'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name. However, I love all the other features in the magazine! It is Cooking Light, but there is so much more - always an article on a travel destination, an article on beauty, and an article on a sport, as well as other constants. The theme of the magazine is total healthy living, incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food, though I do think that it is mostly a food magazine. I gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good, some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive. 
Okay, this magazine ROCKS! The recipes are absolutely wonderful and easy to make. Plus, they're healthy!! What could be better than that?? In terms of healthy cooking, this magazine is my #1 fav, with Rachael Ray's new magazine a close 2nd 
I have been receiving Cooking Light for about 10 years now. I love this magazine. Frankly, it is about the only place I go for recipies. The first thing I do each month is go to the back of the magazine and right to the Index page and check out the "Greatest Hits" for that issue. That is where I start. I would love to make more from CL, but just don't have the time. I do love the web site and use it extensively for recipe searches. Even tho CL offers the yearly recipe index, it is easier for me to find it on line, print it, then put it in my 3 ring binder. Thanks CL for such a great magazine 
I have been subscribing to cooking light for three years now and it never disappoints me. There are lots of recipes, usually 85 - 90 to issue, so I am a little confused with those whom complain that there are not enough. There is a wide variety also, from the crazy and unique to the regular but re-vamped. I do not have kids but I have made several recipes, such as Mini Ice Cream Cakes and Chicken and Dumplings that I would deem perfectly acceptable for younger children. My only warning to perspective buyers is that some recipes can be quite time consuming and some ingredients are quite expensive. When I get in a pinch I will substitute something close if I don't feel like shelling out the extra money. Overall I am very pleased with the magazine; both the living and recipe sections 
For anyone who loves farms, horses, and stories of life in the countryside written by readers. Beautiful pictures. Magazines: "Country", "Country Extra", and "Farm and Ranch" from Reiman Publications 
American photography could only WISH they knew what real photography is. (hint: american publications only knew 2 things-- 1) what's popular, and 2) how to censor everything that said, PHOTO displays exactly that--beautiful photos. leave the american's to their own crap 
I subscribed to Details because I'm interested in the male psyche. I also like looking at the male celebrity pictures and the guy models on ads. Its not the most politically correct article on the planet, for one the last page is called "gay or...?" In which the writer tries to uncover if a certain type of person is gay or not, and no conclusion is actually ever given so I suppose its for the reader to decide. Its a very stereotypical part of the magazine, but beyond that there are cool articles to read from male perspectives. I also enjoy reading the celebrity interviews, in addition they include interviews with female celebrities. I don't agree with everything that is printed here, but certain articles have made me think and I've actually gotten a lot out of it. It helps me understand guys and I do agree with certain opinions. The mag leans toward the liberal and is unabashed in its attitude to do so. I like it a lot, it may not be for everyone and that's fine. 
Jeff Goldblum's character in "The Big Chill" said that he couldn't write an article longer than the average person could read during a, er, "trip to the library" (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, know what I mean?). The writers at Details seems to have the same marching orders. In these hectic times, maybe that's not so bad. The articles I have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized. I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages. I do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age, that could be tunnel-vision (grey hair, I remember Filmore East, you get the picture?). My suggestion, take a look. It's a magazine with an interesting voice and it may be for you. 
Details is a men's magazine like Cosmopolitan is for women. The contents of Details is like that of other men's magazines like GQ and Esquire, but Detials has a tendency to have more articles on movie stars (such as in the May 05' edition with articles about movie stars: Mat Dillon, and Mark Wahlberg)along with articles on politics/recent news, etc. BUT, Details also has articles on: fashion, culture, food and drink, movies, music, books, etc. Detials magazine is more for individuals who want to know about news/politics among other things than for someone who is more geared towards fashion. 
despite its controversial past, i've subscribed for years and enjoy this magazine a lot. definately a lot of good articles 
A good start to create your own business 
Man this is it, great mag for cool business people. What you do not know, you will after reading all this great info. Read on !! 
A friend of mine told me about "Fast Company" a year ago, and I have been a subscriber and avid reader since then. The magazine is enigmatic, combining a news magazine, cultural commentary, business reporting, and entrepreneurial insights into one publication. Many issues deserve a five star rating, but occasionally cohesion and editorial focus is a bit uneven. The thing I most like about "Fast Company" is the 21st century approach to news and analysis: it is thought provoking, explores all sides of complex issues, but never tries to tell the reader what to think. A perfect example of this is in the April, 2006 issue in the article "Al Jazeera's (Global) Mission," in which a former US Marine now working for the English-language version of Al Jazeera is profiled in an extremely multi-faceted story. The entrepreneurial bent of the magazine is great for younger managers and small business professionals, and the reporting on market trends is second to none. Although there are times I don't agree with the articles or editorials in "Fast Company," I always find them intellectually stimulating and thought provoking. I recommend this magazine to independent thinkers everywhere 
Fast Company is an excellent magazine that covers many different subjects in the business field. Not just financial information but how human relations and innovative ideas have and will change the face of business. An excellent product at any price 
This is the finest popular publication for classical music, and it is a wonderful complement to more serious publications such as Fanfare. Highly recommended for the collector, both amateur and serious alike. The CD that accompanies each issue is a marvelous addition. Inevitably I am exposed to new artists or performances on the CD that I wouldn't otherwise consider simply by reading the magazine. The combination of the magazine and CD is a great gift for young people as well. The CD exposes them to new music (and can be downloaded to their MP3 players!) while the glossy magazine gives them access to thoughtful insight and analysis. And yes, the magazine does have the ads from the major companies and their blockbuster stars. But I also enjoy reading the specialist ads and in so doing learn of new, unique music appearing on disc. 
This might sound strange at first, but I confess: Of course I subscribe to The Gramophone for its critically perceptive and unfailingly well-written reviews and features, but perhaps what I love best about this magazine are the copious and informative record-label advertisements! Just leafing through the Nov. or Dec. 2004 edition, I see full-page and even two-page spreads showing: * All the lastest issues in the Gramophone Awards series -- a series of mid-priced reissues by Universal (Philips, Decca, and DG) of recordings that have won a Gramophone Award. * All the latest issues in the Rosette Collection, another series of mid-priced reissues by Universal of recordings that have been awarded a rosette by the Penguin Guide. * All the latest releases by Hyperion, DG, Sony, RCA, Philips, EMI, Virgin, Naxos, Naive, Classics for Pleasure, BIS, Chandos, CPO, MD, etc. etc. etc. In other words, if you're a fairly assiduous collector trying to stay abreast of all the latest recordings, you will find The Gramophone invaluable and indeed unsurpassed in this respect -- both for new releases and reissues. And the ads not only give you catalog numbers and release dates; they also inform you which recordings have won which awards and garnered accolades from which critics. Browsing the ads in The Gramophone every month is *the* best way to see all the new releases -- not even the most well-stocked classical-specialist CD shop would carry all these titles. And what's more, many many desirable classical CDs are *never* issued domestically in North America, so how else are you going to find out about what's available in Europe? Furthermore, every issue contains a 4- or 5-page section called "New Releases," which lists very specific product info on every CD issued that month by over 100 record labels (!!) -- and that's no exaggeration because I actually counted them. New developments I've noticed since Gramophone's significant makeover in the Nov 2004 issue: Gone is Robert Layton (to BBC Music Magazine), apparently traded for Jeremy Nicholas (from BBC Music Magazine) -- these are new developments, aren't they? So it is no longer true to say that all three Penguin editors write for The Gramophone: with Layton gone, now only Greenfield and March do. (I will take this opportunity to say that I still miss Baroque critic nonpareil Nicholas Anderson. His moving from Gramophone to BBC Music Magazine is the reason I started reading that mag in the first place.) Finally, by way of rebutting the previous reviews on this page: As you can see from the above list of record labels that advertise in The Gramophone, it is no longer true (if indeed it ever was) that the magazine kowtows to the "major" labels. Fact is, The Gramophone's critics recommend as many or more recordings on such "indie" labels as Naive, Harmonia Mundi, Hyperion, Chandos, MD, CPO, Capriccio, Glossa, Linn, Avie, LSO Live, Telarc, etc. etc. as they do for the "major" labels: Sony, RCA, Warner, and Universal. And it is certainly *not* true that the next quality recording is more likely to emerge as an MP3 file from Russia than as a new release from a "major" record company -- and the reason for this is simple: The record labels -- all of them, including the indies -- have today's greatest artists under exclusive recording contracts. Until the likes of Vengerov, Perahia, Manze, Biondi, Minkowski, Harnoncourt, Jacobs, and a hundred others are free agents making their own recordings, the record labels will remain as relevant -- nay, indispensable -- as ever. And you won't find the VPO, BPO, Lahti SO, or Concertgebouw popping up on an obscure MP3 file either! And therefore, The Gramophone's "business model" -- earning revenue from record-label advertising -- is hardly obsolete. Quite the contrary, and moreover The Gramophone has been quick to embrace "indie" labels such as Harmonia Mundi (the mag's "Label of the Year" last year) and ventures such as the LSO and SFO issuing their own in-house recordings. In fact, the reviewer below who predicts the imminent demise of The Gramophone (and by extension all classical mags, including Fanfare, Diapason, and BBC Music Magazine) sounds much like the Gramophone-resenters at Classicstoday.com, who have been making the same claims for quite some time. Such resenters and their ilk have apparently never learned this simple lesson: You cannot build yourself up simply by tearing others down. (Attention Classicstoday.com: Want to earn some critical clout? Then learn to write, for crying out loud... Take Hurwitz, for example, who routinely exclaims: "This is the best recording of X or Y, period." Period? This is supposed to enlighten and persuade me? But pardon me, I rant and digress.) Finally, even if we assume for the sake of argument that The Gramophone and Fanfare offer the reader an equal amount of equally well-written reviews -- and I'm really not convinced this is true -- but assuming this to be so, I give the nod to The Gramophone for all of the above reasons. Fanfare doesn't offer the superabundance of information about the copious amount of new releases and reissues, and therefore isn't as useful a tool for staying current with *all* the new releases. And I must admit -- call me superficial if you will, but I must admit that Fanfare's lack of production values makes it relatively unappealing. In fact, based on its appearance and feel, it reminds me of a slightly larger-sized version of Reader's Digest. I freely admit that I love the tactile and visual qualities of The Gramophone -- the large glossy pages and photos and graphics and ads all make for very pleasurable perusal. By contrast, Fanfare can seem like an underground newsletter. I do believe that having more than one critical perspective is a good thing, and while I would certainly not discourage anyone from subscribing to Fanfare, I still think that The Gramophone is the obvious first choice 
I recommend this magazine to writers and readers who love mystery stories. The stories are enjoyable. They have an old time flavor that I like immensely. The writer interviews have been some of the best I've ever read. I highly recommend this magazine 
Although the stories and interviews in The Strand are well worth reading, I think it is worth saying that there are not many stories per issue, and, at least in the case of John Mortimer's Rumpole stories, they are taken from forthcoming books. That being said, The Strand is worth the four stars I've given it, but I would describe it as a "coffee-table" magazine, if such a category exists, due to its glossy pages, large size format, and relatively low number of stories and interviews in content 
If you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis, Forbes and Fortune are the two conventional choices. I started reading Fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when I realized that the business people with whom I associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages. It fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits. Fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends. You won't find anything radical here, but you need to have read it if this kind of news, analysis, and opinion fits your job description or personal interests. There is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson' in each edition. For me, the highlight is Stanley Bing's delicious, irreverent, and every so slightly jaded backpage column. I routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at Bing's corporate lunacy as I do. Fortune is behind the eponymous Fortune 500 and other derivative lists. For me, one of the most valuable is the magazine's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue', though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests. Other readers will tear out or access other Fortune lists online with equal interest. If you're in business or work with people who are, you'd better be reading Fortune or Forbes or both 
"Fortune" is a classic on the newsstand, and is as vital and important today as ever. "Fortune" generally caters to people with a managerial bent, especially upper-level executives, but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world, the global and national economic climate, and forward-looking technology and trend information. Each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story, like the Enron trial, or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year. I do enjoy the articles where they rank things, but more than the rankings themselves, I am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings; while I don't always agree with the magazine, I do always find it good food for thought. The features are generally very polished and accurate, and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a CEO as to a college business student. I particularly appreciate the interviews that "Fortune" has with key players in the financial industry, and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue. The magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like "Kiplinger's." Nonetheless, the investment advice and insight "Fortune" offers should generally be held in high esteem. I also appreciate the coverage of key trends, and in particular want to note that "Fortune" has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in America: coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader. Many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money; while there are several I would recommend, "Fortune" remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends, and should be a part of everyone's business library 
Of the Big 3 (FORTUNE, Forbes, and BusinessWeek), I like FORTUNE the most. BusinessWeek feels like it's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing. Forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose---to report and analyze the business world. FORTUNE profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way BusinessWeek does 
This is the first time I have subscribed to this magazine. I really like the article topics but wish that there was more data included to back the articles. 
stupid that for bad supply side business i havent gotten the magazine and wont get it for at least another month and yet i am asked to write a review for it. BOO AMAZON WHERES MY MAGAZINE 
I am a IT prof. Thus, I subscribed to this mag.; only with the perspective to gain a "little" insight into the working of the brain, instead of having to go through tons of myraid med. literature. What I was pleasantly surprised with and I really mean it - is this editorial board's ability to present even day-to-day matter which even "might" concern some neural science in such a lovely and beautiful manner; that even my wife (who's just a plain house-wife) loves to read. The subject matter discussed IN NO WAY can be considered to be MEDICAL, but rather a CRITICAL APPRECIATION AND DISCUSSION of every-day issues and stuff we notice around each each day. The amount of advertisement is bare minimum ; quality of print is excellent ; the writings are terrific. ONE OF THE BEST MAGAZINES TO HAVE on SHELF. (Proof - my sister's 16-yr. old came to visit me. She's BUILT on video-games, Skype/AOL chat and MS Civilization III. She opened this mag., started to read it and finished the 4 issues I had till midnight! 
This is my favorite magazine about the mind, particularly with respect to consciousness. It's like a meeting of the minds (no pun intended) between spiritual phenomena and scientific discovery. The articles are seriously interesting and always have a new twist. I do wish it was printed more frequently however it is worth the wait for each issue. 
This is the best magazine I've read lately. It is still new, and I've only received 4 issues, but read each cover to cover, finding each article fascinating, and very accessible (unlike the parent publication, which is occasionally over my head.) It may be just because I like the subject matter - but it seems to me these are subjects which would interest most people. Some recent articles (as of Oct. 2005) included why we lie, the meaning of dreams, the nature of consciousness, what causes creativitity, what is deja vu. It is one subscription which is well worth the money. The only drawback I've found is that it is quarterly - sometimes it seems like a long wait between issues 
I got the shipment just as ordered. No problems 
Subscriptions started promptly and I loved every issues. I cant say enough about Amazon.com. Everything they do is 1st class. You have a customer for life. Thanks! 
This magazine has very good photos and cute stories that warm the heart. Very pleasant for dog lovers. 
This magazine has everything for a true dog lover. The articles are the highlight of the magazine. The magazine also features a list of breeders which I found very useful in finding my companion, Murphy the Maltese 
I have or had aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents strewn all throughout the South. My dad is from Texas. For a New Englander like me that has always been quite a dichotomy. I have traveled and spent time in all 13 Southern states. Ever since grade school we were taught there were 13 Southern states based on those states that seceded from the Union during the Civil War. I am not sure what exactly constitutes Southern State theses days! I have always liked Southern Living Magazine. It is a quality publication. I enjoy the Homes and Foods sections and often refer to the Travel sections when making a Southern trek. I finally got to see Savannah proper last spring and I was quite impressed. Some things stand still over time and Savannah has many squared off sections of park that bring you back. I also referred to Southern Living magazine on several trips down to Arlington, Virginia especially for checking out some food ideas. Some of this magazine brings me back and evokes images of the old south yet it certainly remains current on what is going on and what is fashionable now. If you enjoy the South, have roots there or just plain out feel some affinity to our national heritage from this region of the country, this magazine is highly recommended. I truly have a fond place in my heart for this magazine. As for my family, I have relatives in Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina. 
So, you want to know where to stay, what to see, what to eat, how to get there, when to come, and who's who in the old South??? Look no further than the pages of "Southern Living," a superb look at everything new and old about the region. With great photographs and accompanying text, the magazine is a must-have from visitors and residents alike. There's no place like the South and the magazine recognizes this fact and proudly displays its best 
My mother-in-law, knowing how much I love to cook, decided to order me a subscription to Southern Living as a Christmas present last year. I'd flipped through issues before and even purchased some of their cookbooks in the past. Also my mother has a collection of her own. I was surprised to find a consistency of quality once the magazine started coming to the house regularly. The recipes are always well organized and easy to follow. Many of them are quite easy to make, with only a few requiring some cooking expertise. Granted I like a little higher level from time to time, but there methods are great for beginners and even some recipes for kids find their way in. Beyond that, I really didn't care much about the rest of the magazine, but curiosity drove me to read through them thoroughly once I was done with the food section. What a marvel of decorating ideas and home rennovations as well! The entire magazine is filled with tips and ideas for how to add that little southern flair into your everyday lifestyle. It's everything from Florida to Virginia, Tennessee to Texas. Even if you live in the north, mid-west or pacific coast, there are a myriad of great and helpful ways to improve your homestead. This is a wonderful catch-all magazine, great pictures, informative articles and useful recipes. I like to make up a couple of the dishes and surprise my friends and family. As always, feel free to use the recipes as a guide and add your own ingredients to the mix. That's one of my favorite ways to cook them! Truly a must-own for anyone who is thinking of adding some spice and sass to their househould 
This was an easy way to activate a subscription and at a better rat 
Great magazine. This is not my typical type of read, because I've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi-media. But the great thing about this magazine is that you don't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos. It tells you about them in simple terms too, no high-tech vocabulary needed. I feel informed whenever I read my monthly subscription, of the better products to purchase, as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies 
I like this magazine and appreciate the subjects covered in the articles. The technology updates and reviews are informative. I always learn something new after reading it and that makes it worth it to me 
Where else can you get a magazine that talks about whatever it wants? From the perspectives of guys obsessed with computers, technology, and electronics, you get to find out news on just about anything remotely relating to these topics. Political, scientific, hollywood, businesses, technology, I love it. I get to read about topics that are covered in mainstream news sources, and on the next page, what's new with Japanese schoolgirls. I get such a kick out of it. I also love the pseudo-geek talk that they caricature. It's kind of stupid that reviews are all "wired" or "tired" but in a funny stupid way. And buried in the enjoyable trash of this magazine are of course, all the many articles about new electronics that I love to keep up with. Like popular science, only not lame. Well, I do like popsci, so I shouldn't make fun of them. 
Oprah is an inspiring role model for millions of people. I believe that her mission is well-known- to help people live their best possible lives. It's rare to find another person who so consistently sticks to their "mission" and really change lives talk show after talk show, and magazine issue after magazine issue. If you want to make your life better, live more passionately and meaningfully then The Oprah Magazine will definitely help you out. It contains many interesting, inspiriting and balanced topics on a broad range of subjects written by excellent writers and contributors. I am glad that the magazine still contains many really readable and informative articles appropriate for every woman who wants to feel happy, empowered, informed and intelligent. I enjoy this magazine because it opens my mind to the world and celebrates life and womanhood. Each issue has a theme such as love, health, home, fitness, etc. and will cause you to take a serious look at your life and see how you can further improve yourself. You will find interesting and up-to-date information about fashion, movie stars, book recommendations, delicious recipes, money, relationships and friends. My favorite section is her quotes on bookmarks. Oprah Winfrey is an example of a modern, smart and sensitive woman who consistently uses her talents and staff of editors to bring us the talk show and this wonderful magazine. I think that your greatest benefit will be to gradually realize and energize her main message-You should be the first priority in your life, because if you are confused, exhausted, dissatisfied, depressed then you will not be able to help anyone! The magazine covers all of these important areas and I am pleased to recommend it. Following Oprah's tradition to draw attention to books of great value I recently read and highly recommend to my male and female clients scientist Ritz' bestseller "Scientifcally guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" because it truly delivers great value and results. I dare say that this magazine and book will dramatically change your life for better 
if oprah made a magazine and it wasn't that good i would still read it but luckily she writes a great magazine and it is called O. oprah helps starving kids eat and crippled kids walk and that is the kind of neat stuff she puts in her magazine. i have to hide my copies of miss whinfrey's magazine because my brother takes them and tears them up because does not know how great a magazine it is right fellow oprah's magaine readsers???!!! if you want to learn to be a millionairrre with pretty dogs and have lots of people come to chicago to see you you will learn how in this magazine 
I have been a subscriber for years and have grudgingly paid more and more every year for my subscription. Still I have always loved PW and look forward to my weekly edition...although I do not always receive my magazine in a timely manner. Whether because I live on the West Coast or if it's just the mail, I don't know. Sometimes it arrives way into the following week, sometimes closer to the beginning of the week. I still find the magazine valuable, but have to say the following: For a magazine directed at the publishing trade I find it ludicrous that there are so many typos in the reviews as well as the text. WHO IS DOING THE PROOF READING HERE? There is a new format that has updated the look, but I miss the best seller lists being in the back of the magazine. Now they're somewhat in the middle and one definitely can't just easily flip to them. Also, the Q's with authors are so stupidly placed in issues which don't contain the review of the author's book who is being interviewed. Instead, there is a reference date to the issue said book was reviewed in. It's frustrating to read the Q and then not be able to see the review of the author's book in the same issue. I guess the publisher thinks people keep the magazine at least 4 weeks or issues just lie around the house or office and pile up. I like the "Deals" columm and "Hollywood Reader" column, but my very favorite section is the Author Profile. I am curious tho about the age of some of the writers in this publication... I'd also like to know how the magazine and the editors decide what book should get a starred review. Sometimes I'm astounded as to what gets starred. The website, which you get full access to when you register as a subscriber to the magazine, is easy to use. Even before I receive my issue in the mail, I can see the latest issue on line 
I have been reading the NY Times Book Review for many many years. There rarely is a week when there is not some review of considerable interest to me. Though I oppose its political bias which is left liberal, I appreciate the solidity, and respectful way in which most reviews are written. There is a sense that for the Times books and culture in general have meaning and importance. The 'Times ' tends to bet for its main articles on proven winners. A review in the Times can make a person's name, and many many are the writers whose books have arrived in the 'Times' offices never to be given a real look at. The 'Times ' articles and reviews are not the longest and the deepest but they do often provide pleasant reads, and arouse real interest in the book in question. The NY Times Book Review is still of first importance because the NY Times is . I still try to skim through every week searching for the review or two that I really have to try to chew and digest. 
The New York Times Book Review is designed for an archetypal NYTimes Reader: a person with a solid liberal-arts education with moderate-to-liberal political views who is eager to appear up-to-date with contemporary literature - serious fiction, popular biographies and non-fiction in the social sciences. Popular fiction, serious science and other subjects are usually omitted not by design but because of space constranits, I believe. That said, most reviews seem to be thorough, fair and educational in themselves, although occasionally you will note that a reviewer may have a significant, important bias concerning the author s/he is reviewing. Some times this isn't revealed and leads to weeks of debate in the letters column. In recent years more attention has been paid to so-called children's literature, which is helpful. The fiction best-seller lists are almost meaningless anymore, as they are crammed with thrillers and romances almost of the drug-store variety, but the non-fiction best-seller lists can be a way to find something new. There are few specialty columns (or any columns at all, come to think of it), but the venerable Marilyn Stasio has done an excellent job of covering the huge mystery field and keeping readers up to date on their old favorites as well as promising newcomers. The Times' book world tends to be occupied by authors who have already passed an invisible acid test of acceptability. You'll have to seek out truly new voices in less traditional publications. That said, the Times Book Review keeps you up-to-date on all of the important books and provides additional sustenance for the average, well-educated reader of somewhat broad tastes 
I say almost due to the fact that Aperture gives them a good run for the money. You know those photography magazines with about 10 pages of pictures and articles and the rest is advertising? This is not it! If you enjoy a magazine that delivers informative photographing techniques, get this one! If you are interested in seeing the work of other photographer's, get this magazine! If you want a hot collectible, GET THIS MAGAZINE!!! Yes there are ads in here, but not a ton of them. For you guys (and girls) out there who love to see the occasional beautiful star photographed, get this magazine. One of the aspects of this magazine that I like, is the fact that the photo layouts are sometimes full page, unlike some magazines where you have to get out a magnifying glass to view the photos. And this one IS a hot collectible, though the French version of it is an even hotter collectible. Whether it's nature, special effects, or provocative photography, this one is a superb magazine. In short, this one is a must get for the photography fan 
Fitness magazine? Uh, no I don't think so... You do get a very good look at their bodies though. I was shocked to see my local supermarket carrying this. It's about as racy as a magazine can be without crossing the "naked" barrier (it puts FHM, Maxim, et al to shame, and not just in terms of bare flesh - the photography + writing are better, too). In conclusion, I will say that I wish this had existed when I was a teenager - I wouldn't have had to ride my bike miles across the moors to buy Penthouse from the Indians (who couldn't tell how old I was) 
In some circles, to arrive at the office without having read the Wall Street Journal is like turning up in your boxer shorts and a sneaker. In other circles, the same can be said of 'CT', as it is known to regular readers, which include virtually everyone of influence in the evangelical movement in America. As a CT reader for more than thirty years, I have lived with this monthly's evolution from the thought journal that the late theologian Carl Henry wished it to be, empowered to drag American evangelicalism - kicking and screaming if need be - out of the cultural backwaters. Gradually, and by means of the separation of Henry from the project, it became a more general-access piece of the kind that fellow founder Billy Graham is said to have desired. General access is no kidding. Circulation has mushroomed over the decades and given rise to something of a Christianity Today Empire around evangelicalism's Mecca, Wheaton, Illinois. With CT, you get news, analysis, some extremely well-written columns, and a dose of measured opinion, all of which purports to represent evangelicalism's 'middle', even if this is a constantly moving and morphing target. More belligerent alternatives (think WORLD magazine) have sprung up to lead the culture wars, Southern Baptists have been largely coopted into the evangelical movement, and frequent contributions from evangelicalism's Christian college faculties have made CT a confident product of the evangelical establishment. Now firmly distinguished from fundamentalism - a distinction that, astonishingly, is still routinely missed by cultural elites from outside the movement - CT allows itself to cringe at antics on both the left and the right of American Christianity. The magazine has also developed a fine instinct for recognizing the leading edge of Christian activity before it becomes a recognizable trend. Hugely influential, occasionally claustrophobic, rarely maddening, always worthwhile. CT is the WSJ of the neo-evangelical movement. 
As a self-diagnosed Christianity Today junkie, I cannot speak highly enough about Christianity Today as a thoughtful and comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the Christian faith. CT was the brainchild of Billy Graham fifty years ago, and it maintains his strain of Christian perspective, namely evangelicalism. Graham was never interested as a preacher in answering every bit of theological and doctrinal minutiae, nor does Christianity Today aim to do so. Instead, this magazine truly covers the full spectrum of issues that impact the lives of Christians, from news stories of current events and biographies of leaders within the church to analyses of important social and spiritual matters and controversial battles (past and present). CT offers a genuinely global perspective of Christianity, telling missionary stories from around the world in each issue. There are stories of successful and thriving churches of every stripe and descriptions of the victories and successes that occur within all sorts of denominations and ecclesiastical organizations. And they periodically include debates or discussions from opposing sides of important theological ideas, offering folks from both sides a forum to state their case. One of the things that I appreciate most about Christianity Today is their passion to do journalism the right way as Christians. They publish articles by writers with whom many of their readers will not necessarily agree, and they chronicle the lives of many folks who may be outside the church or at least affiliated with a fringe movement. They do all of this while maintaining an unabashedly clear evangelical center, which is most clearly communicated through the editorials in each issue. I love the heart of this magazine and its leadership. I love their approach to their charge as evangelical Christian journalists. I truly read each issue, cover to cover, including all of the advertisements and even the classified ads! I feel like I remain a well-educated and informed Christian when I immerse myself in this amazing resource. I find myself copying or forwarding links to at least one or two articles from each issue to friends and family whose lives I know will be touched as mine always is when I invest in reading from the pages of Christianity Today. I would recommend it to anyone. 
So often when looking through magazines I haven't found quite what I was looking for in the Christian literature. I like the approach Christianity Today takes. It has articles that are broad, and not focused on a specific demonination. I believe the magazine has a slight evangelical bent to it. I do like the variety of articles, and coverage of current events. I would recommend this magazine for those who want to become a little more informed of Christianity in the modern world 
This is a decent magazine and it's good to support an unabashed Christian magazine. But if Sojourners ~sometimes~ errors to the left- Christianity ~often/ persistently~ errors to the the "right." I subscribe to both, and if I find myself agreeing with the editors of one magazine too long, I dig back deeper into the Bible and then come out in the right place. Contributor Yancey is an inspiration and a true Christian voice; while Colson is deluded by the high places of power and is a stain on an otherwise reasoned approach of CT 
Let me say straight up, this is a great magazine..it is one of the few magazines that is consistantly good. I have been a subscriber for seven years and I can say without reservations that this is one of the best magazines in print. The contributing writers like, Christopher Hitchens are first rate, I will admit Hitchens is an aquired taste, but he always makes me think..and laugh everytime I read his essay's, whether I agree or not. I also enjoy reading Dominic Dunne's diary, he really does have a great life, and he knows everyone..who's anyone, granted he is a total gossip and a social butterfly, but he knows it, he is in on the joke so to speak. I was afraid the quality of the magazine would suffer when the singular Tina Brown left, but Greydon Carter has continued her steller helmsmanship. I highly recommend this magazine, I really don't know a soul who has subscribed to this magazine that has not loved it..honest 
I am a new teacher, and this magazine has all kinds of fun craft projects and ideas to use in your classroom, as well as up to date articles about what is going on in education right now. I woulld definitely recommend this magazine to anyone not only who is a teacher, but who has children. Most of the crafts and articles pertain to families as well as teachers 
I subscribed to this magazine for useful tips I could use for my own children. Not only did I find that helpful, I have also used the information to apply to my high school classes. Thank you for the wonderful ideas 
I have picked up Romantic Homes Magazine at the stands whenever it is available. I find it to be the very best magazine for those interested in decorating in the Romantic Style. The pictures are absolutely the best I have ever seen. I love the themes of the homes and the ideas are just overwhelming. I find that you can pull together the look that they show you easily and without spending $1000s of dollars. The fact that there are very few advertisements is a big plus for me - I do not like to read ads in a magazine and if there are too many I disregard the magazine. Romantic Homes has developed the very best for those that love the style - and there are many of us. Now they just need to get the magazine on more news stands (you know in the grocery stores - in Walmart etc the places that people see and buy magazines). If you love the color pink, white, cream, celedon - If you prefer roses and peonies - if a cozy quilt and a fluffy pillow call you to a day of relaxation - if a English country garden intrigues you to planting perrenials in the yard - If you like furniture that looks well loved - if Valentines day makes your heart flutter - Then this magazine is for you 
I still haven't quite gotten over the demise of Victoria magazine but Romantic Homes has helped. The photography is not as beautiful but the ideas shown offer possibilities an average person (i.e. not wealthy) might incorporate into one's home. At first the designs seemed primarily shabby chic and while there is still a lot of white rooms portrayed more color and variety has improved the spreads. I would like to see more garden articles 
I absolutely love this magazine. I look forward to sitting and enjoying it every month. I only wish it would be a weekly magazine because I can't wait for the next edition. I use so many ideas from Romantic Homes. Keep those great ideas coming 
Poetry Magazine from Chicago has been a fixture in the realm of American literature. It's the THE best and the least trendy, slick, topical publication on the market. There are works in all forms in all concerns and modes of expression plus terrific reviews as well as thought provoking essays. For the best deal on subscriptions, try to hold back until holiday time when they offer reduced prices through their website. If you love good literature treat yourself to these higher standards 
Poetry magazine out of Chicago has been around since stew was invented. (When mankind first crawled up out of the swamp and discovered fire, what they had for dinner that night was stew). Well, ok, they're 75 years old and counting. You don't hang around that long unless you're the best. I first discovered them in a college library - many, many years worth of copies - it was a treasure trove of the 1st magnitude. There's invariably one or more poems (if not the majority)in each issue that'll make you glad you subscribed. No, they're not big on pictures (none but the cover - and I remember one year when it was a drawing that didn't change for the whole year...urg) - but it IS the best Poetry Magazine you will ever find 
POETRY is fantastic, and I've always loved it, and I'd never say a word against it. No, no. But if somebody left me a hundred million dollars, I'd get just a wee bit jazzier. I mean, for god's sakes. I understand staying true to your origins, but you can at least get some pictures or something. For a hundred million, you could print issues on babylonian scrolls. You could have every page play music to accompany the poems. Where are the holograms? Where's the perfumed fold-out centerpieces? Where's the frontispiece of fine Indian silk? For crying out loud, who made these poets so damned austere? I thought you people were hedonists and sybarites. I expected you people to blow half this hundred mil right away, re-enacting the Iliad or something. But noooo.... You have to be sensible, just like everybody else in the world today. Forget you, Poetry. Take care of your 401Ks and your KEOUGHs and your TIAA-CREFs. You're just like the rest of them, you sell-outs. You mutual-fund buying push-overs. I'm heartbroken. I thought you poets were the last vestige of impracticality in America; but you've shown yourselves to be real solid folk. Wouldn't your fathers be proud. Isn't Berryman smiling in his grave? Or Walt Whitman. Or John Ashberry. (Is he dead yet?) Forget it, Poetry. You've let me down. I expected opulence; I expected a party that only poets could throw. I expected a celebration of life worth at least 30-40 mil. I give up. Nevermind. I still enjoyed the issue, however. Fine work. Keep it up 
I've been buying this magazine since it first came out. I let my subscription lapse for a few months and sure missed getting People in the mail on Fridays. It's back and I'm glad! 
I enjoy reading my People magazine every weekend. After a hard week of "real life", it's nice to read about celebrities and their fancy lives and clothing, and also about some of the normal people that have done something extraordinary. People is feel-good reading, but it's a nice break from some of the violent news and depressing economic stories we hear every day. 
This is my favorite magazine. I subscribe to a lot of them but always end up reading this one the most. Keep up the good work 
Everything has gone smoothly from the moment I ordered Entertainment Weekly from this seller. It's a pleasure to do business with them and I plan on using them again in the future for my next magazine purchase. 
The smartest, best-informed, and most, well, entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture. I read it cover to cove 
Indispensable guide to what is happening in movies,television,books,and popular culture. Comprehensive,witty,well-written and,of course,entertaining 
Being a registered Libertarian, this magazine falls along my line of thinking. The articles are varied, easy to read, informative, and accurate. The printing is professional and on good stock. If you are middle-of-the-road politically, give this one a try 
this is just a good magizine it's sprinkled with humor and good inquizative thinking if i could give it six stars i woul 
Meagan Good and Jessica Rabbit made some great covers happen for this mag. Melyssa "Jessica Rabbit" Ford owns this magazine with her stunning [sex appeal]. She is the bomb 
This is the best most complete music magazine out there. The interviews, sections, photographs reviews are all great. The award winning review section is incredibly wide and complete. It's clear these people care about music 
...it is also one of the things that makes me think of home when I am not there. Q has a definitve style in the music market, while most music mags focus on a musical genre or a particular target audience, Q lets any music or artist with an ounce of talent or credibility be their prize. To this end they have featured musical interviews with everyone from Madonna to Leonard Cohen, Blur to George Michael. The breadth is incredible, the journalistic style is artistic and grittily honest. The interest and need to share on the subject of sound talent is endless. The only musical snobbery you will bare witness to here is an avid aversion to the growing "pop stars/pop idol/American idol/x factor", style dross which floods todays market. Thank goodness they do so instead of pandering to it without question like the mass of vile celeb trash mags do! I use the term "celeb" in it's loose sense here since one only has to show ones naked behind on Big Brother to be labelled with this dubiuos accalade these days! The best testament to Q, for myself and many Brits, was that the late great John Peel (Uber DJ and font of all musical knowledge that was worth knowing) loved the magazine. It kind of is a printed "Old Grey Whistle Test" I suppose, Peel's much loved BBC live music show from the 60's, 70's and 80's. If you love music then you will love Q 
...even though I have to agree with the previous reviewer that they do have some favorites (inc. Beatles,Radiohead,Oasis etc) and you find them on almost every issue. But if you sort reviews carefully you'll be alright.. 
Q magazine is a brilliant magazine laden with British humor, bonus CDs, special edition magazines, and more. Being a fan, I bought the Led Zeppelin special edition issue, and it was more complete than any novel! It was about 150 pages and contained full-color pictures, info on each album, concert, experience, myth, book, review and bootleg imaginable. When critiqueing an album, they used the opinions of others and the band members as well as their own. This magazine CARES-rather than gushing, ranting, or offering biased opinions, it gives the impartial truth about bands-new and old 
Great magazine. Published out of the UK. Excellent features and great bits of trivia. My favorite sections are Cash for questions (readers send artists questions and win cash)-someone asked Lou Reed if he really performed Heroin for a conference of psychiatrists and won 25 pounds, NOW (new artists),Instant Karma "where pop and philosophy meet". Also great music reviews, more than 200 in each issue of a wide variety of music genres. But what they do really well are lists -top 100 albums ever, The 90 best albums of The 90's etc...my favorite being "when rock stars go crazy - The 100 greatest acts of Rock'n'Roll Folly"- No.1 being Michael Jackson statue sails down the Thames (river in london 
If you're a fan of science, this is a great magazine that covers a wide range of topics. Most of the time the topics are over my head, but the magazine gives you enough information to get the gist of it and prompt you to learn more about it. The subscription definitely took about 6-8 weeks to kick in, but they did send me 2 consecutive issues to make up for the delay. I would definitely recommend this magazine 
An excellent source of interesting science and technology articles. The magazine covers a variety of topics, and presents information so the reader's knowledge base is enhanced and challenged. Illistrations, within the perodical, further enhance the reader's grasp of the topic material, all excellently done. A must read for those who desire a deeper understanding of our technical, scientific world, and cosmos. 
I guess I still subscribe for the pictures. ;-) Yes, there was a time when Scientific American was so difficult to read and understand that I always felt like an idiot, even when I was an award-winning physics major in college (yeah, hard to believe!). Now it's a great way to keep up with cutting-edge scientific thought. I still don't entirely grasp the latest String Theories or Loop Quantum Gravity, but I can read those articles and--admittedly with the help of graphics--get an idea of the implications of the theories, and how they work with or conflict with other theories. Most of the hard-core articles are still written by research scientists, but these authors have become better writers, and they have learned that the audience is like me: The general population, wanting to keep up on the latest cool stuff. There are still purely scientific periodicals where they can publish their equations and use the latest jargon. I'm thankful they "dumb it down" for the rest of us. In a time when good science is often dismissed by the general public in favor of "What the BLEEP..." and other popularized pseudo-science, I am incredibly thankful that Scientific American is still true to the scientific method. 
I purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew, who just loves it. It is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it. Now only if he would put it down so others can look at it 
This science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person. Articles are good, not overly technical in depth. At times it gets in its doldrums of articles, but generally it holds it own. You don't have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same. But it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot. It does at times takes some thought of getting used to. Their 'special topic issues' may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic.Well received for the high-schooler either as the magazine or the website. At least the layperson can be science informed. The title of the magazine says it all 
I read Scientific American occassionally back in the 80's. At that time I found the articles (especially the physics articles, which I love) to be especially dense and poorly supported by graphics. The quality was there but it didn't quite get across to my younger self. Now, I find the text to be very good and superbly well-supported by side matter and graphics. I would call this an improvement (both in the magazine and, perhaps, in myself). However, I didn't read it regularly back then, so perhaps the negative reviewers are correct in saying the magazine has been "dumbed down". If so, then it was from a very lofty level as the articles continue to require a reasonable background in their subject areas. For example, the article "Computing with Quantum Knots" was just right for somebody who has read a number of non-mathematical treatments of this topic and who, like me, has read parts of the Feynman lectures and things of that nature. It was a sophisticated and intelligent article. There are many more examples I could give. My only gripe with Scientific American (and this has been true for decades) is that I just don't like medical articles and the magazine regulary has them. This, however, is a personal matter and reflects my interests not the quality of the magazine. I strongly suspect the "format was changed", as some said, because the publisher wanted to improve it for everybody and catch a few more readers. Certainly, I would not have subscribed to the old Scientific American. It was too dense and too boring. Now it is just about right for me. But that's me. Your mileage may vary 
After getting a sample copy (no, not because of my illustrious career as Amazon reviewer--as if), I have plans to subscribe for a year or three. The articles are relevant, meaningful and well-written, and what more can one ask for? I sometimes wonder if being subscribed to two science magazines is overkill, but nah... what with all the new discoveries shaping our world, it is a good idea to keep abreast of every little thing happening in Vulcan's Lab. Scientific American is more, well, scientific than Discovery which tends more towards popular subjects such as Darwinism, under attack by a minority in the U.S. political sphere, but largely unquestioned in the scientific community. While I support Discovery's positions, they are preaching to the choir as far as I am concerned, and I do not need persuading as to the relevancy, veracity and applicability of Darwin's theories and the theories of scientists who have built even larger and more fascinating structures based upon Darwin. So if you're looking for Science Lite, go with Discover, but if you're a serious amateur scientist who already knows all the basics, go with Scientific American, or if you're like me and just can't get enough, go with BOTH, because both are REALLY good 
Many readers complain that 'Scientific American' has fallen from its former glory, and that the articles are not written with the depth and expertise they once were. I cannot really comment on this as I was never a close reader of it. What I can say is that as a general reader 'Scientific American' through the years has informed me about many of the latest developments in various areas of science. It has also provided a vocabulary in understanding certain scientific concepts. I have learned often from 'Scientific American' what major experts say about subjects which are of great interest to me such as development of artificial intelligence, human evolution, the search for extraterrestial life, cosmology, and much else. I always find the articles very clearly written and understandable. I learn from it and enjoy it, and on this basis highly recommend it to others 
The images in this magazine are always first rate and the editors get access to houses no one else does. The writing is also very good and the houses chosen for each month are always in varing designs and spectucular. This magazine does have a certain reputation of being on all the coffee tables of the wealthy, but is not Town and Country, it really is a magazine that takes its name seriously and the writers are well informed and have skill. Pick it up sometime, it's worth the effort. 
In summary, this magazine portrays houses that you can't possibly ever hope to own in an "airbrushed" presentation that can't possibly match real life; it is "house pornography". It is exciting to read and puts plenty of ideas into your head. You have to determine whether repeated exposure to this type of media will enhance your life or make you miserable. Hey, if you have a spare million dollars and need someone to tell you what is fashionable or in good taste--this is for you! People complain about the ads--I complain about the articles. People get in the way. I note that none of the owners of these showpiece homes have children--most are living alternative lifestyles. Actually, the house becomes the product of the relationship instead of children. It is a fascinating cultural phenomenon and this magazine is the leading journal of the movement. 
I love this magazine. Some reviewers have stated that they disliked some of the interiors. That's fine and fun! I show my husband some of the things (he's a graphic designer) and we have a great time laughing at some of the designs. Other times it's absolutely great. The latest issue (Aug. 2004) is one of the best and the theme is Exotic Homes Around The World, and they are all fantastic. Of course I wish I could afford a lovely home such one of these in the magazine (maybe one day?) but in the meantime I can look at these homes and dream and also get great design ideas. This magazine is wonderful and relaxing to look at and read 
I'll have to agree with the other reviewer that Men's Jounal may not be quite as good as it used to be. But it is still the best men's magazine around IMO. Flip through the other men's magazine fodder at the grocery store or your buddy's place, and save your money for a subscription to Men's Journal 
People is a weekly American magazine of celebrity and human interest stories,the magazine runs a roughly mix of celebrity and human interest stories,People is perhaps best known for its yearly special issues naming "The 50 Most Beautiful People", "The Best and Worst Dressed", and "The Sexiest Man Alive".I think people magazine is a wonderful magazine because I can keep in touch on what is happy to the actors and actress. What the good movies are that are good for me to watch. I think ya'll do a good job with the magazine. It is worth reading every time I get it.People also includes reviews of new books, cds and movies. 
An interesting and enjoyable magazine if you like reading about celebs. If not: This is not the magazine for you. Very rarely will you see someone on the cover of people for being involved in politics or saving someone's life or whatever. Instead you'll learn about Branjelina's baby, the ongoing divorce struggles of Jess and Nick, and other such stuff. But I am not condemming the magazine; I myself enjoy sitting down with it every week and would reccommend it to you 
I find that many people had a lot of negative things to say about "People" magazine and its coverage of celebrities. Opinion leaders are opinion leaders because they have clout and power and communication lines. What they say and do does make an impact. I don't find it offensive to read about them, and I also create my own life and don't need to be "entertained." My suggestion is to be less critical and more active in making a better world. The opinion leaders are for the most part, doing that better than the average guy, -- that's why they are opinion leaders. Dorothy 
Item was delivered when I was told it would be and I didn't have any other issues regarding this purchase. I'd say that's pretty smooth 
You will see for your self why I like this magazine when you bought it &amp; did you see her big ass 
I've been reading Glamour for the past three years and it has been a great magazine all around. Glamour covers topics on health, career, finances, sex, relationships, style, etc. Of all the magazines on the newsstands, this one is the most intelligent and savvy for women in their 20s and 30s. Yes there are too many ads like in most magazines, but that's how the media survives, they get their salary mostly from ads. I usually don't mind because I feel that its such a great magazine, that the ads are worth putting up with. I have felt that at times Cosmopolitan is a little too focused on sex and "please your man" articles. Glamour seems to have found a nice balance and I don't feel that it dumbs down my intelligence at all. I do wish that they would expand beyond the typical articles. I wish that they would include more sections on culture, travel, and technology. Men's magazines include articles on gadgets and tech, and as a woman I enjoy gadgets as well. Its not just a guy thing. Its not a perfect magazine, some issues are better than others, but I feel that at this time Glamour is the best magazine for women right now. 
I like this one better than Cosmo. Great info on beauty and the like 
I just renewed my subscription to Glamour because they are one of the only magazines I have ever read that feature both a significant amount of affordable items (i.e. less than $100) as well as intelligent, relevant articles about women AND men. Sure, they have their "off" months, but I really appreciate that ads don't tend to dominate the magazine as much as others (especially for as low as the subscription rate is). I also can't wait to see the "Do's and Don'ts" every month 
This has to be my favorite magazine because It has a little bit of everything. Cosmo is about more carnal subjects, Marie Claire has many serious subjects, Vogue is pure fashion, Allure is practically a beauty bible but Glamour has all these things it's that versatility that I like 
After I bought Glamour off the news stand, I read it and completely loved it. The previous reviews were a little bit out of date here on Amazon, and in my opinion, a magazine can transform dramatically in a year, if not less. There's definitely a lot less fluff and a lot of wonderful articles in 2005. For example, there were articles about the emotional hardships with a mom whose kid is mentally ill and the story of up coming star as a happily adopted child. There were articles on women who struggled so that girls today can play in Little League, women can get credit cards and keep their job when they get pregnant. There's a lot of important and powerful article on women's rights with a dose of celebrity life. My favorite article was Aisha Tyler showing us how much digital touchup can do to cover models....it definitely made me feel a lot better about my body. I felt like Glamour had enough dosage with fashion, health news, beauty tips, and celebrity life, but still did a great job to remind us the greatness of being a woman. I gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I had flip through 6 pages of ads before I got to the table on contents. I suppose that's how magazines make their money, but I can do without. Other than that, great mag! If every issues is like the one I read, I'd subscribe to it in a heart beat. 
Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine is the only financial magazine that we subscribe to, as it meets our needs perfectly. We recently purchased this magazine to give as gifts to our two sons, who are just now beginning to consider the best way to save for their retirement. We know that by reading Kiplinger's they will learn a lot about the stock market, retirement plans, mutual funds, and much much more. We highly recommend Kipplinger's Personal Finance Magazine to everyone 
Received the first issue 3 weeks after placing the subscribtion order with amazon, so that was faster than promised. Kiplinger's has a wealth of information and I look forward to receiving it every month. As I am exclusively holding mutual funds and no individual stocks, some of the information in the magazine is of no interest to me. For that reason I prefer Money magazine. But reading both magazines on a monthly basis for $1 per issue keeps me more disciplined and focused on saving money and that's worth every penny of it. 
I have read several financial magazine: Money, Forbes, Business Week, Fortune, Smart Money, and Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine. I must say that of all these magazines, Kiplinger and Smart Money are the two most useful magazines in terms of personal finance. Of this two, Kiplinger is the better one. I find that most finance magazine provide very narrow opinions on investment and finance planning. The writers of Kiplinger, however, provide very diversified opinions on investment and finance planning. This may not sound like a good idea for novice, but it is certainly a welcome feature and the most feature, in my opinion, for a sophisticate reader 
When the Armchair Detective stopped being published, I was without a good mystery magazine. I received a complimentary copy of Mystery Scene and I subscribed to it. The magazine is published 5 times per year and features great interviews and good book reviews. I especially enjoy their reviewing lesser known authors and books by independent publishers. My favorite part is the "Where Are They Now" which features authors who seem to have stopped writing a particular series, many of whom I have read in the past. An excellent publication 
Mystery Scene is a feast of fascinating articles, excellent interviews (check out Alexander McCall Smith, in the summer 2003 issue), intelligent reviews, and all kinds of information about the world of mystery writing. In addition, it's that rare magazine of any genre--an absolutely un-put-downable, cover-to-cover read 
I have been an avid reader for over 40 years, I was always looking out for magazines that gave book reviews, I tried them all including New york Times Book Review, found them lacking at alot of ways. When I subscriped to Pages: The Magazine for People Who Love Books, I was exploring again, but; I found this the best and most comperhensive magazine on book reviews, it is what I've been looking for a long time, give a try, I sure you would be satisfied as I was. 
I don't know why so many people don't like this magazine. It's everything a person who really likes books could want. There's decently written articles, and there's so much information in every issue. I know I should like the other publication better (I won't name it), but I prefer this one. I don't only like reading books, but I also like looking at their covers and stuff too. I love browsing, and when I can't get to the bookstore I open up a copy of "Pages." 
Great Magazine!!!! Do not order it through Amazon--major headache! Go online with the magazine directly. They remedied the problem immediately...Something Amazon Magazine Dept. couldn't figure out after 7 months...really, 7 months. No problems with the book ordering but will NEVER order a magazine this way again 
If you're ordering this, you should know what you're getting, because I assume you've read the magazine before. However, the only downside is, it took a full 10 weeks to receive our first copy. I recommend it, but understand that you will probably have to buy two issues off the newsstand before you receive your first subscribed copy. 
My new favourite magazine! Beautiful photos, smart and entertaining articles, fashion, art, exclusive celebrity interviews... all with a dog focus! Cover models range from Paris Hilton and Tinkerbell to Virginia Madsen and her dogs. Thanks to Modern Dog I now know how to throw a dog-friendly cocktail party (complete with hors d'oeuvres for both two- and four-legged guests) AND actually get my dog to come when she's called. Definitely worth checking out 
I have been very pleased with Family Handyman since receiving my first copy. The featured articles are particularly well done. I especially like how each project they present is well photographed and labeled. If you want a monthly installment of ideas and guidance that will really help you learn and execute some great home improvement projects give Family Handyman a try 
I have been subscribing to this book magazine for over 2 years. During that time, I have been exposed to so many wonderful books and authors that I never would have heard of. Not only does the magazine cover fiction and novels, but it also covers other genres and interests as well. In every issue they interview a book club and the club shares what books they have loved or not liked so much. They also have a "have you read" section which interviews people on their favorite books. So if you want to increase your exposure to books you otherwise may have missed, this magazine is perfect. It's also enjoyable reading in and of itself. Their reviews have also saved me from reading books that I really wouldn't like after all. 
This magazine has it all, and you don't have to leave the comfort of your living room! Smart, savvy book reviews...highlights on different genres such as the crime novel or non-fiction books...spotlights on successful book clubs...and outstanding feature articles on classic and modern authors. Everyone from John Steinbeck to John Cheever. Reading Bookmarks makes me want to revisit old books and try new ones; It also turns me on to authors I've never "tried" before. Recently I started reading books by Amoz Oz because of the feature in a recent issue. And I would have never given authors like Jodi Picoult or Kevin Brockmeier a chance had I not read the reviews of their latest. In addition to all the great goods on books, the magazine is one of the best looking mags on the market--great color, fantastic pictures, and an easy-to-read layout. One of the best things about Bookmarks is its straightforward and intelligent approach to books. It doesn't simply sensationalize bestsellers or cater to the Hollywood version of authors and their work. It focuses on the book, the author, and the joy of reading...and this is perhaps what Bookmarks Magazine does best.Where else do we just sit and enjoy something for the sake of enjoying it? So forget navigating traffic and finding a place to park at a bookstore--just give Bookmarks Magazine the time it deserves and learn what to read next 
I'm a recent subscriber to Bookmarks and I'm finding that it is a very enjoyable and very well edited magazine. Bookmarks reviews books by compiling reviews and ratings from multiple different sources and by citing the representative insights from those reviews. A summary of the book and overall review and corresponding score out of 5 stars is then given by Bookmarks. This has the obvious advantage of giving you many different people's opinions about a book along with those of Bookmarks itself. The selection of books reviewed has a strong focus on literature with a good coverage of the key science fiction, crime and non fiction books. In addition to reviewing newly released books, each issue explores a thematic topic such as ancient greece or the french revolution and finds experts to nominate the best books on that topic. There are also articles that detail famous authors, giving a good discussion of their works and places to start reading if you are interested in knowing more. Key best sellers lists and book prizes are also covered allowing readers to keep abreast of which books are being formally recognised. This would be a great magazine for keen readers or book collectors and particularly those people who collect modern first editions. The less time you have to read the more valuable this magazine will be at pointing you in the right direction. 
As a reader, I become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month. I usually rely on friends' recommendations and more word-of-mouth advice, but that's never been enough for me. Reading a book is an investment to me, and I want to make sure my time is well spent. Bookmarks gives me the confidence that I'm choosing the books I truly want to read. I also find that the author profiles in Bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes (such as the ones on Mario Vargas Llosa and the very interesting Japanese writer, Yukio Mishima, which also shows that Bookmarks looks globally, not only regionally, for classic authors). 
I just received my first issue of Bookmarks and absolutely loved it!!!! It has SO much information in it, and I even went right online to order some back issues! I do wish it was a monthly magazine, but I'm very very happy with it -- definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to read and is looking for reviews of both popular books as well as books you'd not ordinarily hear of 
I bought this magazine as a gift subscription for my sister in law. She raved over it so much I bought it for myself and wow. It is a great magazine. We generally read it cover to cover. It is truly what it claims to be- a magazine about family fun. There is a section on rating or planning family vacations. We could do without this one section but even then it is well written and interesting. Other sections include family games, outdoor games, theme parties, crafts, and more. Kids cooking recipes, how other families solved problems, toy book and software reviews and even more. It is jam packed with fun things to do. Many of the kids things are directed towards children who are about 8. However, my children who are younger than 8 enjoy many of the things here and look forward to the magazine so they can find new things to try. My niece who is older than 8 still enjoys the activities in this magazine too. This is a great gift for a teacher or a person who has children. 
I never had my own subscription to this magazine. My mother-in-law subscribed and then would send it to me when she was done. I have saved every copy. There are so many great ideas in this magazine. They had one to make a playing card holder out of coffee cans lids. It was great for my 6 and 3 year old for playing UNO, especially when you have a lot of cards to hold. My 13 year old is selling magazines for her school and FamilyFun is one of the magazines available. I am ordering it, I miss reading it since my mother-in-law's subscription ran out. (I was hoping she would send me a subscription for Christmas since she knew how much I enjoyed it.) It's a great magazine for parents, grandparents or even aunts and uncles. There are tons of things to do and great advice as well. They have a website that has some of the information from old articles (like the birthday cakes). 
This is the best magazine for the busy kids to keep them busy. I was really impressed with the easy of the crafts and the details in the instructions. I love this magazine 
Unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents/teachers, this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do, that don't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials, and that are very attractive when finished. I also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it -- very important when it comes to encouraging creativity. 
Great magazine for families with kids! My son loves all of the activities that can be done! Great price too 
I have been a subscriber to Family Fun for 4+ years and I have always enjoyed the magazine. I don't remember ever being disappointed in an issue. I usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles ideas I want to keep on file for future reference. In most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most. With Family Fun I always end up with a huge stack of ideas that I want to hang on to. What is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that I actually use and apply in our everyday lives. Practical, useful and fun are all words I would use to describe this publication. My favorite features include: "My great idea" - submitted by readers "Family Almanac" - seasonal activities and resources and the travel ideas. We have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned. Some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by Disney. I'm not sure why that is such a problem, but I do realize some people don't like Disney. The truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway. At least the Disney company has helped Family Fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine. I don't find that Disney is overly promoted (a rarity in the world of Disney I know!) in this magazine. There are plenty of reviews and references to very non-Disney products such as the Harry Potter series, Shrek movies, and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a Disney enterprise. This magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating 
Frommer's Budget Travel always has something I can use - every month. Their 20 quick tips are great, the features are actually trips that can be taken without breaking the bank. 2 thumbs up 
This magazine is one of my nightly treats! I take it with me to bed and read it until I fell asleep, dreaming about the vacations awaiting me. This great magazine covers just anywhere in the world. I have learnt a lot about travelling. I even love it's advertisements(the vacation packages) 
Arthur Frommer's "Budget Travel" is a terrifc magazine for those thinking about travel or vacation. In the 10 issues you get over a year(for a "budget" price no less), you'll find hundreds of ideas for places to go and suggestions on how to get there, when is the best time to go, where and what to eat, where to stay, local shopping, the list goes on. And..the great part is the writers of the articles have done all the work for you. They have combed the web for the best prices, attractions to visit, and for accomodations that suit your needs, and in most cases have actually visited the destination or taken the Road Trip to let you know how it went. There are articles of interest for those wanting a family style vacation( a recent article, listed and wrote about camps that the entire family could attend, with various price ranges), romantic getaways or business trips. Maybe you are looking for the best cruise deal, or want to tour Europe. There's something for every style of travel. Every month there is a "Trip Coach". People write in and have a good idea of where they want to go, and BT plans out an entire itinerary for them. "Road Trip" is another monthly feature that plans out an excursion through a particular area. These articles give lots of details of places to go, and things to do and see along the way. They also give you a breakdown of choices in different price ranges, of hotel accomodations, travel modes, restaurants, and attractions. In a recent article they even listed which hotels where geared toward people interested in environmental issues. So for the person looking for some great ideas for a vacation, or anyone just wanting to get away for a while, this magazine offers excellent advice. However, I thought there were too many ads for vacation spots that were "over-budget". Also, I would have liked to have seen a little more for those wanting to travel for an extended period of time. Maybe for those retiring, and want to see the country in a RV for example.(although there was an article recently on how to BUY an RV, there wasn't much in the way of travel ideas). Overall, you really get your money's worth with ideas for travel, and a periodical that will save you time and money. It's a good place to start your vacation plans, and you may not have to go any further! Enjoy....Laurie 
Most photo magazines handle analog and digital photography as separate entities. This magazine is the perfect bridge between the two media. Besides that, its articles are very insightful, with a more artistic and professional tone than most photo magazines, but without falling into a snobbish attitude. Furthermore, they avoid that commercial point of view that hampers a good photo magazine. The only thing I regret is the lack of technical information about the pictures they show. Anyway, each issue is a pleasure to read 
The target audience of this magazine is really for those interested in keeping up on etiquette and the status of the social circles around the country. I have been reading it for about ten years and I love it. Not only have I learned a tremendous amount but I have been inspired by it's helpful articles and beautiful photographs. Thank you 
Regular readers of my reviews are probably getting sick of me mentioning Kage Baker, but I have to credit her for getting me to try a lot of things that I wouldn't normally try if she hadn't been a part of them. Asimov's Science Fiction magazine is another time where this is the case. While I have bought Fantasy Science Fiction magazine every month for a while now, I would also check Asimov's to see if it had a Baker story. If it did, I would buy it. What I have found, however, is that I have enjoyed most of the other stories in the issues I have bought as well. Thus, from now on I will be buying it every month too. Much like Fantasy Science Fiction, Asimov's contains mostly science fiction stories of various lengths (short story, novelette, novella) along with a couple of columns and some cartoons. The difference between the two is that Asimov's contains no fantasy (though some of Mike Resnick's stories have a fantasy feel to them). However, the magazine likes to concentrate on character-based science fiction, so you won't see a lot of "technology first, character second" stories in the magazine. Personally, I think that's a good thing as hard science fiction turns me off. If you're more into the hard sciences, you may find stuff in here to interest you, but there's a good chance that you won't. Occasionally, there will be guest editorials (they printed George R.R. Martin's Guest of Honor speech from Worldcon in the October/November issue). There's always an "On Books" column, sometimes written by Paul Di Filippo, sometimes by Peter Heck. The authors use this column to recommend books that you may not have come across. Robert Silverberg opens each issue with a "Reflections" column that can cover everything from space exploration to ideas on story-writing. James Patrick Kelly occasionally is featured with an "On the Net" column, examining various science fiction web sites and other online activities. Unlike Fantasy Science Fiction, there is often some poetry included as well. Finally, there is a calendar of upcoming conventions that covers the world so you can always find someplace to go if you need to get together with a group of fans. The bread and butter of the magazine, though, are the stories. Each story has an introduction from the editor (currently Gardner Dozois, though that will change to Sheila Williams with the January issue), which may explain the genesis of the story, or just tell us how long it's been since that author has appeared in Asimov's. One of the things about Asimov's that is different is that it often serializes stories that will eventually appear in book form. Allen M. Steele's Coyote series has been serialized over the last couple of years with all of them being collected in two books (Coyote from a couple of years ago, and the upcoming Coyote Rising). Also, Charles Stross' Accelerando has been featured in recent issues. The one drawback to this is for readers who only pick up the occasional issue. For instance, "Survivor" in the October/November issue didn't really mean a lot because I've missed everything that came before it. It does reward regular readers, though. Asimov's has many writers who write almost exclusively for that magazine, or at the very least the authors submit their stories to this magazine for first refusal. My favourite, Kage Baker, only seems to appear here, with only one story that I know of appearing in Realms of Fantasy. Allen M. Steele is another. Robert Reed seems to be featured everywhere (I swear that guy is churning them out like he's a machine) but he is featured a lot in Asimov's. The magazine is bound just like Fantasy Science Fiction, however the cover is thin paper rather than thicker stock, so it will tear a bit easier. This does have the advantage that you can sometimes leave it lying open for reading (though this only works if you're toward the middle of it). It also means it can be rolled up if necessary. The only other fault I have with it, and this is strictly a personal thing, is that the stories don't always grab me as much as they do in Fantasy Science Fiction. This is mainly because I'm more into fantasy than science fiction, so this certainly wouldn't be the case for everyone. While the hit and miss ratio varies from issue to issue, I can say that I have never skipped a story in the magazine. Again, that's a benefit of short fiction. You're not going to waste a lot of time on them. If I had to choose between the two magazines, I would definitely choose Fantasy Science Fiction. However, Asimov's is certainly good enough that it's easy to make room for both of them. Plus, by picking them both up, I feel like I'm doing my part in keeping short fiction alive. It's only a small part, but every little bit helps. David Ro 
I have subscribed to Asimov's for 15 years. It is the very best Sci Fi Magazine out there. All the best authors that you have heard of and many that are undiscovered treasures. If you are a fan of short Science Fiction then you will not be disappointed 
Yo he leido varias revistas o magazines como tambien les llaman tales como,Seventeen, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Self, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Teen, Lucky, Teen Vogue, Marie Claire, por mencionar algunas,tanto las versiones en ingles como en espaol y definitivamente me quedo con Elle.Es superior a las demas, primera tiene excelente fotografia y muy buenas impresiones, su moda es cosmopolita y global, ademas de que presenta diseadores nuevos que aun todavia no son conocidos pero gracias a esta revista sus carreras son impulsadas rapidamente a la fama, sus propuestas y reviews sobre cine, musica, libros y teatro tambien son muy buenos,tiene cultura pop pero no es del tipo teenybopper como en otras revistas que se obsesionan con ciertas actrices o cantantes y de ahi no salen. Sus paginas de moda son preciosas aunque es cierto que muchas de las modelos que salen posando en estas paginas se ve que son anorexicas o le entran a las drogas, tampoco me gusta el precio de muchas de estas ropas y accesorios ya que por lo general van de 2000 a 1 millon de dolares, por favor pongan algo mas accesible y economico.Tambien tiene articulos de interes para todos, ya sea de salud,relaciones,sexo,belleza,politica,cultura o decoracion, estos son variados algunos son muy buenos, otros aburridos, otros son superficiales o estupidos, y otros son solo trivialidades. Pero en definitiva esta revista es muy buena, pero eso si es muy elitista, esta hecha para mujeres con estilo propio, que tienen educacion de colegio o universidad, que se visten para ellas mismas no para los demas, a diferencia de Cosmo, Glamour, y Marie Claire que claman ser feministas y en lugar de eso son antifeministas o pseudo feministas, Elle si les da un buen lugar a sus lectoras, en lugar de llenarles el cerebro con puro sexo y tarugadas de como contentar a tu hombre, amigo o lo que sea, y convertirte en una Barbie para el como dicen estas revistas que acabo de mencionar 
I love ELLE magazine! It's better than Vogue, in my opinion, because Vogue is all about too expensive clothes that only rich people can afford, too many damn pages it's basically a picture book more than anything. It's filled with nothing but advertisements pictures of anorexic models. I get bored reading/looking at it fast. Elle on the other hand, has articles that are informative more affordable designer clothes are shown. Beauty fashion is featured, but so is some great reading material. 
I was not a very good Christian a few years ago, my faith had slipped and practically dissolved. Then I was blessed by becoming friends with a true follower of Christ with his feet firmly embedded on the Lords path and content in his place with Him. The young man (he was only 45) brought me back into the fold and back to Jesus. I know it was his wife who secretly sent me the subscription for the first time. It has made such a difference in my life and my husbands, we can read the articles together and get so much wonderful information and answers at times, we never knew we were asking! My "Mentor David passed away suddenly last year, and although I know where he is and is watching over us all, with the help of his kindness, love and faith, between him, his wife, and Today's Christian Woman, my home and family and others who I am able to touch with the joy of knowing Christ, it helps to ease the pain of loss and the knowledge that I am "on the right path". IHN 
This is the only magazine I read from cover to cover. I wish it came out every month! I pass it to my sister after I'm finished with it. It is very informative and very well-written 
People building serious MS apps, the kind where you have to figure out just what "volatile" really means, must subscribe. This is the map to the world they live in. There are lots of ads, covering just about every add-in, add-on, API, component, and service you can imagine, plus some. Do you need to know the difference between clusters, multiprocessor board, multicore, hardware multithreading, and application multithreading? You need this. UI, I18N, .NET, COM compatibility - sooner or later, it's all here. However, not all of us work as MS app developers. If you live outside that world, you'll find just about nothing of interest. //wiredweir 
are you sick of those annoying game magazines that give only opinionated b.s instead of real reviews? are you sick and tired of having a game magazine latch on to one console and ignore all the others? are you sick of overrated games getting good reviews simply because they are hyped up? well so was I and I can honestly say that play delivers. you can tell when your reading a review that the reviewer actually played the game.I also applaud play for saying that grand theft auto is overrated (duh ive been saying that for 2 years) and I havent even gotten to the anime section..yes the people who write these reviews write them just as well as the game reviews. they treat anime as a serious form of art which is something I appreciate all in all if you want a game zine that rates games based on how good they actually are...then here you g 
Play magazine is consistently one of the best, if not the best, in its field. Well produced and always well written, it covers gaming and Anime as serious art with the respect they deserve 
Play is definitely a breath of fresh air for someone who was truly engulfed in second-hand suck. For years magazines like EGM, and GamePro (shudder), were the only multi-platform magazines I would read. I later became tired of their increasing ridiculousness, both in content and reviews, so after being suggested I check out this magazine from many fellow gamers I decided, hesitantly, to do so. I mean how different could another multi-platform magazine be? Very. Not only am I captivated by the wonderful choice of cover art each month (Amazon should change the display cover over to the Shadow of the Colossus one), but the pages and size of the publication are more professional than any gaming mag currently out. (I admit to not having read Game Informer, and due to their Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door fiasco, I never intend to.)I could only think of myself stupid for not heeding the words of others sooner. My first copy was issue 39, March 2005, and Sega was the choice for cover and main content of the month. Wow, was there content. A nice spread on Sega's upcoming lineup, and interviews with company people/developers captivated me more. And the reviews were awesome, and still are awesome as well, sometimes spilling over to 2 pages more frequently than "competitors." I knew right away this was what I was looking for: A magazine that liked all kinds of games and wasn't afraid to show it in both previews and in reviews, and a magazine that did not insult my intelligence, nor choice of games. I have not seen one word of "Kiddie" or "Baby Game" in attack because of colorful sprites, or lighthearted content. Quite the contrary, the magazine seems ardent in its protection of 2-D games, and games that are just fun regardless of how they look; something very welcome in this day and age of gaming. I also like how they can have some biting criticism, but still seem upbeat. Take their 2005 E3 wrap-up issue where they criticized everything from the show itself, to the phantom games, to the specs of the next-gen hardware, but still had positive things to say about them. Not only that, but the magazine had, once again, incredible coverage. How about some interviews with people such as: Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear; Boktai), Tomonobu Itagaki (DOA; Ninja Gaiden), Atsushi Inaba (Viewtiful Joe; Okami), Koji Igarashi (Castlevania), Michael Ancel (Rayman; Beyond Good and Evil; King Kong), Takao Miyoki (Phantasy Star Universe), and Masato Maegawa (CEO of Treasure)? Simply incredible. Not to mention their brilliant cover story of Shadow of the Colossus with interviews of the developers.I cannot say enough how good this magazine is. If I could use my years of knowing gaming mags, to sum up what the magazine is like, I would say it's like a cross between the now gone Next Generation, and GameFan with its anime section--but very much with a mind of its own. (For those worried about the anime section, it's located at the back, so you won't miss out on anything gaming related if you choose to skip over it.) I seriously implore you to give it a chance, even if you are a fan of other magazines. Go to your local bookstore and look through it, you don't have to purchase it, just see for yourself. Hopefully, you'll experience the true difference that is Play 
I've been playing video games since my Atari 2600 (and my lucky neighbors CalicoVision) and I'm happy to say that someone who grew up around the same time decided to start a magazine. At Play they go out of their way to show games that they think are great but that are never going to get any press anywhere else. Also, since the mid-1990's I've been into anime but have only been able to go by word of mouth or more recently by what I see on TV (thank you anime and cartoon network). Now I have play to read, as it has extensive, 20-30 pages of quality anime reviews. The reviewers are more than competent and may actually posses brains, unlike the reviewers in most other game magazines. They realize that their reader is not only the thirteen year old Grand-Theft, Tony Hawk player but also people like me who need humor and intelligence in my reading material. Finally, the quality of printing and lamination on the pages will make you want to keep each one forever and I have reread and consulted past issues over and over. Thank you Play for giving me something other than Bills to pull out of my mail box. 
Loved this magazine. They had such great articles and tips that saved my sanity! LOVED IT and HIGHLY recommend it 
Bride's magazine is probably the best, but Modern Bride runs a close second and is more in line with the average bride of today who isn't going to have anything close to one of those "average cost of $25 grand" weddings. Of course the gowns are showcased, but MB gives priceless information on honeymoon planning, registering, wedding etiquette, even buying and setting up your first home. The subscriber gets more than their money's worth. Highly recommend 
The review of new photo products are excellent. Well written in my opinion. Highly recommend this magazine 
Print magazines are behind current news by about 3-4 months. The websites have news about new digital cameras instantenously. The print magazines are destined to be 3-4 months behind. If you are looking for the latest news, you will get them tape-delayed if you only read magazines. However, this magazine goes more in depth than some other ...popular magazines. The reviews are actually 4-5 pages long, not one-page politically correct recaps of the feature lists. (Still nowhere near as technical as the web reviews). Having said all that, and understanding the limitations of print magazines, this is a good, affordable magazine to read if you are interested in digital photography. It has some useful and helpful information, reasonable reviews, and some interesting articles 
This magazine is so delightful! Fantastic tutorials-great photos and wonderful info. I enjoy it very much and wouldn't hesitate to subscribe again. I heartily recommend it 
After reading several digital photography books, and going to grad school classes... I found this magazine to be far superior to anything published in this country. There are many articles on artists, workshop-type tutorials, as well as the latest and most fantastic hardware and software for the digital fan. I believe this magazine has something for everyone... from beginner to more advanced at relatively low cost. In addition, I have found two other British publications, Digital Camera World, and Digital Photography Techniques (both at www.dcmag.co.uk), that I would strongly recommend for those who can afford them 
I LOVE NAKED WOMEN BESIDES MY SON BEING BORN; SEEING A NAKED GIRL IN PERSON FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS 13 WAS THE GREATEST DAY IN THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE... thank you and have a nice da 
Young naked women: that's what life is all about. But you have to earn the naked part. Until then, by all means get a subscription to FHM. Unbelievable. And if you cannot actually have the women in the magazine, enjoy the articles. Or try getting famous or something. (Russell David Harper would recommend trying to go to the moon if you can, so that you can talk about your experiences, to women, when you get back [see his silly but perfectly honest novel called "Bald"]. Good news: according to George Bush, we may well be going back to the moon, so sign up now . . . 
So let's do it---let's get a subscription to FHM Magazine, standing for "For Him", I think. But who really cares? Do you? I thought not. The point is: Life is Suffering. Life is Agony, Pain, Humiliation. The Buddha proved it, thousdands of years ago, sitting beneath his Bodhi Tree. All parties, however amusing, however crazed, must End. Love must die. The big football game on Sunday will end---has, in fact, ended, brutally, even as I type these ephemeral words, like black petals dropping from a birch tree. Hell, the Superbowl this year was in Detroit---that fact alone may very well have killed Hunter S. Thompson. Anyway, the fact is: Life is Cold, Brutal, full of Nasty Surprises. Full of a great deal of delicious treats, too, especially if you know where to eat and can get a good table---but as Jim Morrison pointed out, no one here gets out alive. So bedeviled, Gentle Reader, as you must be by the Terrors of our Age: Jihadists commandeering 747s into skyscrapers, the never-ending War in Iraq, political bickering by the simpletons who pretend to run the country while the rest of us work, fires, earthquakes, thunderbolts and floods and lightning, oh my!---perhaps you'll take this simple bit of instruction to heart. You walk into the bookstore of your choice. You're going to pick up the Financial Times, mebbe, or the Economist, and perhaps a book on leadership. Or managing teams. Or mortgage-backed securities, whatever. And you gaze at the magazine rack, and your eyes light on FHM Magazine, front and center. Or rather, on the kneeling, buxom, oiled-up beauty gazing back at you from the cover. Buy it. Better yet, *subscribe*. Isn't that better than worrying over the horrors of the World, at least for a few idle minutes? Yes? The Buddha would subscribe to FHM. JS 
After seeing the price of a year subscription to this mag i just couldnt pass it up. Thats chump change for the amount of entertainment this will give you in a year and it makes my trips to the porcelein pony that much more enjoyable. The articles are funny, witty, and a blast to read. And the women. My jaw dropped when i saw the shoot of Leann Tweeden in the most recent issue. :o This magazine will make you laugh, cry, and fill you with joy. Every guy 16-30 should have this magazine in his toilet book rack. 
Ah, the men's magazine. So many out there, where to draw the line when it comes to subscribing? Ultimately it boils down to what is worth the money you are shelling out, and for me, FHM is a cut above the rest for the following reasons. 1. Articles are more intelligently written, less sophmoric, and delve on a wider array of issues. 2. Paper quality is high glossy and sturdy, while other magazines feel like cheap pieces of newspaper by comparison. Paper feels like the same paper used by Playboy. 3. Quality of women featured. FHM has by far a higher quality of women. Maxim tends to pull from a rung lower on the quality ladder, while FHM features beautiful, sexy, intelligent, and funny women whose interviews are actually readable. 4. FHM Top 100 Women Special. Wow. Worth the money right there. [...] Only negative with subscriptions is that these companies will send you last month's issue and count that as one of your 12 issues. That is annoying 
This magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men. It has everything you want, including hot babes, cars, gadgets, and sexy bikinis. It is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff, like the new watches they showed by Fossil and DKNY, and some excellent Martini recipes, and then they turned me on to a DVD called "NEW SEX NOW" which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies. I, for one, am hooked. 
FHM is a Great Mag. I subscribe to this, along with Maxim and Stuff. By far, I prefer FHM the most. This magazine offers, not only eye candy (like the other mags) but unique columns which make it stand out. A way better alternative, is Giant Mag. It's a new guy's magazine, which has interesting articles, music and book reviews, and background information in its articles, along with the standard (eye candy) 
A great magazine for those guys who want to be entertained and look at hot looking women. 
I've been playing for about 2 years and can only imagine where I would be without the help of this magazine. It has a few lessons from the greats (How To's, examples and some tabs and practicing techniques). What more could a budding guitarist ask for? It has product reviews and then interviews with a bunch of guys that I don't really give a crap about hearing from and then some from the guys I wanna hear from. It's like christmas one day out of every month! YIPPEE! I have subscriptions to some of the other MAG's and I enjoy finding out what tabs they've (GW) chosen and it gives me a chance to get a peak at what these fools are doing in those sweeet songs (lyrics, stories from the artists that created these songs and the background/origin of the song, etc.). I enjoy all 3 of the subscriptions but I'm partial to this one for some reason. I recommend this one and Guitar Player if your fresh on the instrument. 
i love both guitar one and guitar world, but i like guitar one a Tiny bit more. But i love both magazine 
I enjoy your magazine and found the Manhattan apartment beautiful. However, is there a logical reason for the zip lock bag on the coffee table (pg.45). Over looked??? Dog biscuits?? I don't think these were available for life at versailles. THIS IS NOT A COMPLAINT. COULD NOT HELP BUT LAUGH. HOPE YOU THINK IT IS AS FUNNY AS I DID. 
In Touch is a weekly glossy magazines that retails at newstands for $1.99. It is very similar to Star and Us Weekly. They offer fodder on the Hollywood flavor of the moment, so expect lots of stories about Julia Roberts, Britney Spears, Brad Pitt, Jenifer Aniston, J.Lo and the usual suspects. It is very worth the newstand price. They rarely, if ever have human interest stories, most of the stories are all about celebrities, style, make-up, or fashion. They also have contests some times. A lot of times I notice they run the same stories and pictures as Us Weekly so if I had to choose between In Touch and Us Weekly 1 year subscription is less I would choose Us because it still seems like they get more exclusive stories that In Touch. Also, some of the news they run sometimes is weeks old, I often think they end up filling space close to print time. It's an okay magazine an worth the cover price 
Yeah, In Touch magazine is basically fluff when compared to world events, but I like their kind of fluff. This class of magazine is celebrity driven without being what I would classify a tabloid (i.e. Star or The National Inquirer). In comparison, In Touch magazine most closely relates to US Weekly and People. Of these three magazines, In Touch has the best quality and quantity of photographs. In Touch's article's aren't as good as US Weekly's, but with a much lower cover price it's worth picking up one when in line at the grocery store. On the other hand, if you are looking to subscribe to a weekly magazine, US Weekly is a better bet because their usual subscription price is $.1.00 per issue versus their $3.50 cover price per issue. Meanwhile, In Touch does not give much of a price break for subscribers. Their subscription price is $.1.49 per issue versus their $1.99 cover price per issue 
(...) Other magazines that write about similar topics are outrageously priced and their articles are misleading and you never learn anything of actual relevance to the topics on the cover. One prime example of this is US Weekly. I have read several issues of this in the past usually by way of someone giving the mag to me when they were done with it and I've actually only personally bought US Weekly twice. But it's style annoys me and it is a magazine that wants to write about interesting celebrity driven issues but often fails. Please do not confuse In Touch with US Weekly. That is what I sometimes think that other people might easily dismiss In Touch as being like US especially since they sometimes feature the same celebs and are right next to each other on newstands. In Touch keeps you "in touch" with celebrities and their important/interesting stories happening week to week with their lives. But you don't feel like a stalker or something reading this magazine as I have read other people comment on US. In Touch always stays a safe distance from celebs personal lives and do not cross the line with their articles and no matter who or what article is being written In Touch keeps up a respectful and tasteful point of view about the subject/celebrity at hand. And they also talk about important things in the public eye, such as in this weeks issue these are a few of the stories: In the People in the News section: Cynthia Nixon's brand new life - this article is talking about how Cynthia has now found love and happiness in her life and her lover is a woman. I had no clue about this till reading the article. The article just tells the straight up facts, a quote from one of Cynthia's friends saying "She is totally in love and has nothing to hide. She has two beautiful kids, money in the bank, an incredible career, an Emmy for that career, and now a girlfriend. So for Cynthia, life couldn't be better and she wants to share her happiness with the world!", and nothing bad is said in the article.. as you can tell, quite the opposite. This is the way In Touch handles itself - it tells the facts and is more about happy things in celebs lives and less about the worse. But what I meant before is it talks about even no celeb issues as in this next story in People in the News: *under the Survivors heading* Montana Plane Crash Miracle - about a man and woman that were at first presumed dead in a plane crash, but the woman, Jodee Hogg managed to free herself from the plane's wreckage and then free fellow parks co-work Matthew Ramige. They stayed with anthor fellow passanger while he died and then left to get help and walked two and a half miles - and Matthew had a broken back and burns. It's really amazing. Kelly Ripa's advice for working moms Is Joaquin still mourning his brother? Prince Harry Gets Serious Mary Kay defends her Crime There is a cover story about J.Lo and Jennifer Garner and what J.Lo thinks about "Bennifer 2" and is she still in love with Ben. But even that is handled respectfully and the closest thing that it gets to sensationalizing it is a page entitled Battle of the Jens but it is more in fun than anything and that is plainly obvious. Here is a few more headings of articles within the mag - I think they are pretty self explanatory so I'm just going to list them: Can You Be Friends with Your Lover's Ex? - Three's not a crowd for Renee, Jack and his former wife, Meg. Fashion Trauma - Even Celebs Strike Out, But Can These Oops Outfits Be Saved? Why Chip and Kim Had to Win $1 Million At Home with Kelly Osbourne - Her Pink Paradise Jerry's Favorite Food Stop - Crossing Jordan star Jerry O'Connel takes In Touch to Carney's in LA The 10 Sexiest Men of the Season - It's raining men this autumn, with Hollywood hunks strutting their stuff all over the big and small screens. What makes them the best? She's a Plus-Size Model and Proud! - America's Next Top Model Toccara is happy just the way she is. Fatherhood Changed My Life! - Mark Wahlberg talks about his journey from crotch grabbing bad boy to devoted dad Is Tyra the next Oprah? And several more. I especially like the section: Is It True? - The Real Story Behind the Hottest Gossip. You can read this and know that what is being told is the truth. I have noticed that way more celebrities open up and allow In Touch to have interviews and tell them the first hand facts than *other* magazines. Also featured in this issue is an article on Kevin Costner's wedding and the reception to be fair last weeks focused more on his wedding and this one more the reception. And it featured different pics/angles than last week's so it was not recycled material. Is Katie's Wedding Dream Finally Coming True? - Now that her boyfriend's divorce is final, America's favorite sweetheart is free to tie the knot and she couldn't be happier! (talking about Katie Couric if you didn't know) Nicole (Kidman) - Pretty in Pink - a look at Nicole in a chic pink outfit and how to copy it for less. The shirt and skirt they pick and the accessories are quite cute and all together cost 240 dollars which is really not bad, especially considering that is shirt, skirt, ring, and shoes total. The average well to do person could afford that if they wanted to. And in every issue is: The Stars Above - Horoscope Time to Relax - Crossword Puzzle Best of the Week - new movies at the theater, on dvd, music and tv Last Words - random funny celeb quotes I've said a pretty good bit about this mag but just because I really do like it a lot and think there is pretty much something for everyone interest wise. Yes it is celeb orientated but the articles as you can see are of wide ranges of interest and topics to do with the celeb world and also non celeb world. I think they definitely want to appeal to a broader audience than US Weekly. I always look forward to buying this magazine and learning the new info on my favorite celebs and sometimes non favorite celebs because the articles are so interesting. I will admit that other reviewers have put me off of subscribing to the magazine because of the poor service of arrival of the magazine in that means. So for now I'll just stick to the newstands especially seeing as how my Allure and Glamour are both late this month but that is an entirely different issue.. But to sum this up In Touch is the perfect price. I mean the only thing better would be if they went down to 99 cents an issue. lol The articles are interesting and well informed and the editiors and journalists seem to have a respect and caring for their subject matter that other magazines in this field. If you see In Touch on the newstands buy it once and just take it home and read it cover to cover and see if you like it. I'm willing to wager that you will. 
This is a great magazine. I recently Started reading it and a few others similar to it. It does give helpful business strategies and financial planning advice. It really is an eye opener to all the ways there are to make money and to have a business not just in one market but in a variety of Markets. 
I have been a subscriber since college days at Wharton. Would never let me subscription lapse if you paid me. The real money players read this magazine 
By far the best business magazine that I have read. Really good articles about up and coming (or down and leaving) entreprenuers, markets, and investing. If you like CNN, you might as well stick with Fortune. It doesn't simply reprint the conventional wisdom de jure like other business publications. You also get FYI (lifestyle) and ASAP (technology) supplements, and their top-notch online content is regularly updated with fresh ideas. I'm often pointed to excellent books through their articles, such as the "Emotional Intelligence Quickbook" which was part of a feature on EQ testing (includes an online EQ test with the book). Forbes always seems to think of their readers that way.. 
Blender's a fun magazine that I enjoy reading for the articles and reviews. It covers a variety of artists and there's never a dull page. I especially like "20 Songs You Should Download This Month." I could however, do without all the half naked girls that are usually a part of every issue. Is this FHM or a music magazine? Still, the other contents of the magazine more than make up for it. The magazine's hip layout and quirkiness (the occasional song lyric next to a page number, or "Word" which features a small pic of an artist and a quote) are a refreshing way to showcase music. I find it to be comparable to the UK music magazines that I've preferred over the years. Plus, Blender's cover price is only a fraction of most of UK music magazines and when you subscribe, its even less 
It is a good magazine. Although, it showcases the same musicians on the cover. It showcases bands like Fallou Boy on the cover more like XXL does with G-Unit. The features are pretty good. I like Ask a Superstar, that is probably one of the best of them. Also, their reviews, I agree with them sometimes, and other times, they give way too low ratings. Also, I have had the subscription for a while now and the magazine never fails to entertian me when it comes to Music. I also like the half naked girls. Don't we all? Give a chance when you can. 
1) A "Why Not?" page toward the beginning of the magazine, with short blurbs on useful things to do. An example: Where to recycle corks from wine bottles. Another example: How to turn dead leaves on your lawn into mulch to fertilize your yard, rather than bagging up the leaves. 2) Lots of recipes and cooking tips (The current issue includes vegetarian dishes.) 3) Reader's tips on a "question of the month." Example: "How do you save money during the holidays?" One winner each month receives a prize. 4) A Solutions section, including "New Uses for Old Things." For each item, the original purpose is described along with an "Aha! Use." 5) A section on organizing. 6) "Road Tests." Four items are featured, with comparisons in each category. This month: winter gloves, food processors, cleansing cloths, and vanilla ice cream. Even if you are not shopping for these items now, the info is useful for later. Two years ago, I bought an extremely reasonably priced set of durable everyday glassware based on their recommendation, and I have been very pleased with the glasses. 7) "Life Lessons." Personal, reflective essays that are very thoughtful and ispiring. 8) Home (including decorating), beauty, style, and body (health) sections. I discovered a great website for world art (supported by National Geographic, not of the commercialized Pier One variety), thanks to them. 9) A "Life" section that includes tips on how to navigate conflicts and difficult situations. 10) This month: A wonderful article on creative ways to preserve your family history. I loved the ideas and loved reading about the contributors' families--absolutely fascinating. 11) Lots of tips on saving money, time, and energy. Many of their tips do not involve trips to the store (or online shopping, for that matter). 12) A cardstock pull-out reference page in the back, with perforated edges to make small cards that you can carry in your wallet. There is always an inspirational quote (this month's is by P.G. Wodehouse) that you can use as a bookmark. Speaking of quotes, there is always a great quote near the front of the magazine and another on the spine of the cover. Yes, there is a target demographic for this magazine. I am not sure whether I would actually fit Time, Inc.'s target demographic--I am a single graduate student, living in a small apartment--but I always learn a lot from each issue. Not every article appeals to me equally, but that is always the case with a magazine. I save the best articles and file them by topic in a binder, along with articles from Vegetarian Times (the only other magazine to which I subscribe) and Runner's World (a friend gives me her old magazines). The hefty amount of advertising is annoying, but this is the result of the consolidation of the magazine publication world. Time, Inc., also publishes In Style, Essence, and many other magazines. If you want a non-glitzy, anti-establishment magazine, read something like B*tch (yes, it is an actual magazine, although I censored the title for this review, and I love it--will probably subscribe one of these days). But if you are just looking for ways to make your life a little easier, order Real Simple. It's not going to teach you how to give up all of your earthly possessions and move to a Peruvian village where you can start your own subsistence farm and weave your fabric from a loom, but it will give you tips on how to make your day-to-day life simpler right where you are. Oh, and Real Simple is branching out: a great website, three published books (on organizing, tips, and cooking), and a show on PBS. No, not TLC or HGTV, but free television for everyone. Kind of populist for an entity of Time, Inc., isn't it 
Nice replacement for my Oprah Magazine. Like the concise and to the point articles. Good suggestions sprinkled in magazine. Very heavy with the advertisements...but then the ads rip out quickly, leaving a more simple Real Simple read. 
"As we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people." ~P.G. Wodehouse, Something New Creative advertising (love the GE firefly ad), practical advice for your home and luxurious perfumes all blend effortlessly throughout the pages of Real Simple. There I was wondering when I should replace a down comforter and this magazine had the answer. They also have some lovely quotes and ideas for decorating your home with Liz Claiborne home items, like the lovely bedding and towels. The do it yourself features are fun with ideas like a hostess gift you make up yourself with a basket and candles. Loved the articles like "organizing your recipes; 8 foolproof methods." But their advice on tossing cookbook in favor of just keeping a few recipes! Hello. There are some cookbooks you definitely want to keep. They always seem to put a spin on old favorites, like the modern cheesecake that is gourmet and elegant. The applesauce cake in the November issue uses chunky applesauce so people might think you spent all that time chopping apples. ~The Rebecca Review 
I've been a reader since day one and the magazine is filled with time saving tips on cooking, space saving ideas and ideas and even wardrobe tips. For $5 Real Simple offers great tips and Real Simple is geared towards real people with real lives and not the New York loft crowd or mid-west country living crowd...not to be stereotypical but that's how most magazines are geared one coast of the other. Real simple is a great magazine and it continues to be number one in my book. 
Great magazine for mind/body/spirit. offers lots of calming stress relievers and great yoga poses. As well a some really ads that lead to excellent websites and products. If I have to do some updating on my Yoga or Meditation gear I look here first to see whats recommended 
I live in one of the "Red States" in the deep south. Therefore, unfortunately, quality yoga instruction and teaching is very hard to find. But, fortunately, Yoga Journal is delivered to my area, providing most of the yogic wisdom and learning that I have received through the years. However I agree with other readers, I don't care for the ads for cars and cellulite cream ~ (who needs cellulite cream btw when you have a regular yoga practice?) I also do not care for the models they use is this publication, most of them look like adolescent girls who have just come from the Senior Prom! There are a few exceptions here when they do a feature on Shiva Rea, Ana Forrest or one of the Iyengar family members but for the most part, this gives a misconception that yoga is just for young, skinny women, what a shame. Having said that, there is alot of good material here, you just have to get past the aforementioned. There is some very good advice on fitness, nutrition and health, athletic injuries ~ from hatha yoga and other forms of exercise. There is also many articles on Yogic philosophy and spirituality and living our yoga by bringing it into everyday life. All in all, a decent publication, especially if quality yoga studios and instructors are scarce in your area. 
This is just the best Yoga Magazine out there. Articles cover all areas and are suitable for the practioner as well as the teacher. I've learned so much from the magazine, and enjoy reading the human interest articles too 
I find interesting articles in every issue I receive. I like the fact that the articles offer a wide range of topics. For example, you will find articles relating to diet, travel, relationships and physiology. All the issues provide yoga sequences that you can practice at home. The magazine will offer advanced sequences that are more physically demanding and simplier ones that are much less physically demanding. The articles portray nicely sized color photos of the pose with in-depth explanations on how to perform each pose. I am a visual person who needs to see the more complex poses performed in front of me rather than described in writing, so unfortunately, I can't take advantage of some of the more difficult sequences. However, if have been practicing yoga for some time and are familar enough with a wide range of poses, or can follow in-depth written instruction, you will enjoy these sections. You may be surprised with the volume of advertisements found in each issue. It doesn't bother me because there still remains plenty of good reading in each issue. You will receive only 7 issues in a 12 month period. It would be nice to receive one every month. Overall, an entertaining and informative magazine that I recommend. Yoga Journal also has a fantasic website that you can explore for free. The website offers many interesting articles and provides instruction and information on many common yoga poses. 
This magazine is very helpful to me in my practice of yoga. Not being able to go to classes, I bought video tapes and books, and have been practicing for about 2 years now with my children at home. Since I began receiving YJ about 6 months ago, I have felt a renewed inspiration in my practice. There is always something new to try, so I don't feel stagnant. The only thing I think could be improved upon would be to add more pictures of men and maybe even children practicing yoga 
Buy this magazine without hesitation. Has wonderful articles from a spiritual and holistic perspective. Thank you so much for creating such a creative magazine 
I have been an avid reader of Yoga Journal for a few years now. This magazine is a must for the serious practitioner of yoga - as well as for those who are curious and searching. Each month, YJ delivers. You'll find information on yoga trends, book and music reviews, philosophy, different styles of yoga, interviews with popular yoga instructors, etc. Routines are featured in every issues as well as in depth coverage on poses. You'll learn more about anatomy and the mechanics of asanas than you ever imagined! As a practitioner, this is a helpful magazine - as a yoga teacher, this is an essential reference for me. I learn so much every month, I can't imagine my practice without it! 
This magazine is the real thing. I believe yoga is significantly more than which blocks help with better alignment, and wish that this were a magazine that supported this fact. I also recommend Tao, Tantra, Sex and the perfect lover By Mabel Ia 
To transform the world, we must begin with ourselves. ~J. Krishnamurti My April 2005 copy of Yoga Journal is looking a little worse for wear. I was reading it in the tub and do take a rather extreme delight in ripping out pages of interest. I have to organize the new products to try in one pile and the pages about yoga postures in another. Then, there is the page about freeing yourself from destructive emotional patterns that I should read at least four more times and the recipe for Chocolate-Grand Marnier Dessert. Of course I'm fresh out of Grand Marnier so I have to save the recipe and put it in the "recipe to make soon" file. The Yoga Journal is not just a fun read for me. I literally try to take the teaching and the ideas and put them into practice. Literally in Yoga practice and more intellectually in taming stress and taking control of my emotions. Not that Yoga is not intellectual because it really is a very intellectually enhancing exercise. Through reading about Yoga you can learn how to calm your mind and learn how to focus on what is important in life. To say Yoga has influenced me for the better is a great understatement. The happiest place in my day is perhaps at the end of a Yoga routine when I feel completely relaxed, without any negative emotions and have a sense that in the midst of the chaos of life, there is a place of peace inside me that I can escape to anytime I choose. If you tend to buy Yoga "workouts" then you will appreciate the "yocabulary" to explore various Yoga words in more depth. There are book/video/music reviews for Yoga inspired items. The advertising seems mostly about Yoga retreats or new Yoga DVDs like Sara Ivanhoe's Natural Journeys 20 Minute Yoga Makeover routines, which I love. Now the only question is, is the Aveeno body wash in my shower a result of seeing an advertisement in this magazine and how many more Tazo teas are there to try? As the Wake Up to Your Life article states: "Why wait around for enlightenment when you can enjoy everyday awakenings." You just know someone's life was changed by reading that one line in this magazine. It definitely made me think. If you love collecting quotes or you enjoy learning more about your Yoga practice, this is an essential Yoga magazine. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
On any list of pure English-language business reportage, BARRON'S would figure in the top ten. This newspaper-style weekly compiles more numbers than just about any other publication. Though 'fluff' is not a word commonly associated with the Wall Street Journal, think of BARRON'S as 'WSJ without the fluff'. That's how focused it is. Electronic availability of business numbers has pushed BARRON'S off the 'must read' list, though it has its guild of old faithful readers who consider nothing else its equal. Published by Dow Jones, it is as focused on Wall Street as any publication could be. Business people appreciate its 'Review Preview' section, which at a glance brings a reader up to speed on last week's business news leaders and next week's announcement and world holidays affecting business. WSJ and the Economist will give you more extensive analysis. Without slighting its columns and feature articles, BARRON'S is for the pure numbers guys and gals among us. They're all in here. Honest 
My students really enjoy this magazine. It always contains very humorous things that my students love. I teach students in grades 3, 4, and 5 and it is always checked out from my classroom library. I would recommend it to parents and students (as long as they watch Nickelodeon) 
This is one of my favorite magazines. It tells you about shows and new ones, movies, celebreties, and more! It also has some interviews with actors/actresses. It has fun puzzles and comics. I love the Scene but Not Heard comics. They are hilarious! Overall, I would get this magazine if I were you 
My nephew loves this magazine. He watches for it to come in the mail for weeks before it arrives. It encourages reading and relates to a variety of current television and reading materials on his age level. He reads it and rereads it. It includes age appropriate jokes and editorial type information on Nickleodeon characters and the Nickleodeon life 
I subscribe to many magazines, but of all the magazines I receive every month, my two favorites are "Dwell" and "Metropolitan Home," which both focus on the contemporary aesthetic in home design, renovation, and decorating. "Metropolitan Home" is my preferred magazine for decorating related tips, while I rely on "Dwell" more for renovation and design ideas. I particularly like the comparative articles, which show how to achieve a specific, expensive, look within the confines of a smaller budget. Make no mistake about it, most of the homes in this magazine are upscale (read "expensive"), but are much more mainstream than the homes featured in more traditional magazines like "Architectural Digest." I also like the attention that "Metropolitan Home" places on details like fixtures and finishes, and I appreciate the balance it strikes between urban and suburban homes. I find "Metropolitan Home" to be an excellent value, and read every issue thoroughly. I am in the midst of some remodeling and home improvements now, and have found many useful tips in this magazine. Anyone who appreciates contemporary architecture or design will appreciate "Metropolitan Home," and as a related aside, I also highly recommend, "Dwell. 
Looking for a nice well-rounded magazine with the major focus on contemporary interior design? Miss superb printing quality, clean European lines, meticulous attention to details? You've got it all in this magazine. After moving here in the US from a major European capital, I have frankly missed a good magazine with the latest trends in metropolitan interior design. Architectural digest is great if you live in a grand mansion in Ladue, but what if you want simple and elegant functionality of a nicely designed European apartment or loft in your typical suburban house. This magazine has been a delight to read (nice coffee table edition too). It has been a source of ideas and inspiration for me for several years now. Recommend highly 
I've been buying this magazine since it first came out. I let my subscription lapse for a few months and sure missed getting People in the mail on Fridays. It's back and I'm glad! 
People is the most incredible magazine. The writers of the magazine know exactly what you want to read as a subscriber, but there will always be an extra section that just does not interest you because no magazine can attract every ones personal interests. No matter what this magazine always makes Friday a great day. I feel the best part about People magazine is the fact that they give you special issues, like 50 Most Beautiful People, Sexiest Man Alive, and Eligible Bachelor. You get a variety highlights in each People issue. You will find inside each issue many sections pertaining to your interest. A section called the mailbox where you get to read other people responses to the articles in the last issue released. The passage page where they will give you all the details of celebrities such as marriages, births, divorces, deaths, injured, or convicted. Finally, I love getting toward the end of the magazine just to be able to read the true crime stories because they are intriguing and quite interesting. The only bad part about People magazine is that most people, just like myself, buy the issues to read about celebrities. But you also get the human interest stories which don't seem to interest everyone. Now I do not have a subscription, but I read every issue, whether I buy them myself or read the magazine at work. I would say that if you wanted to purchase a magazine this would be a great one to choose because the magazine reaches out to any one in their teenage years and up 
I enjoy reading my People magazine every weekend. After a hard week of "real life", it's nice to read about celebrities and their fancy lives and clothing, and also about some of the normal people that have done something extraordinary. People is feel-good reading, but it's a nice break from some of the violent news and depressing economic stories we hear every day. 
This is my favorite magazine. I subscribe to a lot of them but always end up reading this one the most. Keep up the good work 
From a subscription point of view (about $12/yr directly) this magazie is a decent value. While half the information is fluff (looking back - 15 years of innovation, etc.) there is some timely relevant information hard to find easily in a consolidated way. The focus is not just on laptops but mobile solutions - this includes peripherals, PDAs, mobile phones among others. There is some opinion (RIAA vs Sirius) but the focus seems to be vendor/advertiser driven. For example, the cover story of the Mar 2006 issue is on First Four Core Duo notebooks. They review Centrino Duo notebooks from Acer, Dell, Gateway and HP. They run benchmark tests and provide charts, etc. Fairly useful info. Except they don't give the information consistently. The weight of Dell laptop is not even mentioned while those of others is. They do mention a few cons for each notebook but do it gently without a strong opinion. Two of the four systems reviewed are selected as Editors' Choice. The other two still are rated well. There is no single table that compares them all in a single view. You get the feeling, they were trying to please the advertisers and avoided any direct head-on comparision between multiple products. I disagree with their choices as well. How could the Editors' choice be a 6.6lbs laptop from Acer that has an average battery life just because it offers some value? In the same Mar 2006, there is a review of Windows Treo 700W; a showdown between slim phones Moto RAZR V3c and Samsung MM-A900; a short test of Nokia's pocket Internet Appliance and Kodak's first dual-lens digicam; Wifi routers; list of restaurants for business travelers; etc. For a $1/month, I recommend this to anyone who travels a lot and is looking for a quick update on the mobile computing world. If you want in-depth technical info, stick to Toms Hardware or other web sites 
Laptop Magazine is an excellent resource for the mobile professional. The staff has done a great job of reviewing products relevant to those individuals attached to their laptops and related gadgets. Despite the name, the magazine is not merely about laptops but also the tools and strategies for the peripatetic white-collar worker. With information on laptops, mobile phones, hotels and airlines, Laptop Magazine is loaded with great insights. Its layout is excellent as it appears far less cluttered than other computer magazines - much like how the Harvard Business Review differs from Star Magazine. Yet, it is a bit light on specific computer tasks and tweaking. This may be due to the demographic of the audience, which is most likely a collection of mid-level executives and sales professionals instead of hands-on technology gurus. As such, the magazine is well worth the read as it will certainly save time with your work, travel, and technology purchases in the future. Pros: Excellent product information Great organization and layout Cons Light on nuts and bolts computer technology No concise source of the laptop reviews (i.e. like Motor Trend has a summary of tests with dates and results with every magazine). 
I haven't actually read Analog for about 20 years, but it was my introduction to science fiction very nearly 40 years ago, when I shared a flat (sorry, must use American, an appartment) in New York with one of John W. Campbell's editorial assitants! Since then, the genre has provided education, solace, amusement - and some disdain from others - and I despair at how few really good new English SF writers there seem to be. However, anyone (and I do mean anyone) who tries Analog with an open mind will find it a revelation 
Disclaimer up front: I've had three novels serialized in ANALOG (Nebula winner THE TERMINAL EXPERIMENT; Hugo and Nebula nominee STARPLEX; and the just-completed HOMINIDS). But I'm also a long-time reader of the magazine (28 years now), and I love it. The fiction is real SF -- stories in which the science is accurate and the speculation credible. But I also love the editorials by Stanley Schmidt; the Alternate View columns by Jeff Kooistra and John Cramer (some of the best science writing available anywhere these days), the spirited letters-to-the-editors section, and Tom Easton's book reviews. This is the number-one bestselling science-fiction magazine in the world, and justly so 
I've been a subscriber for about 40 years, from when it was named Astounding, and almost never disappointed. In addition to great authors (many of whom I met first on Astounding/Analog pages), great short stories, reviews, and feedback - don't miss the thought provoking editorials. No matter who is the current editor, the editorials make you check your firmly held beliefs and preconceived notions, and *think*. You may not agree, but you'll definitely think. Well worth the money 
I ordered this magazine for my husband and he can't wait to get each issue! He especially loves the free cd dvd that come with each issue. He's heard alot of cool, new music and read up alot on some of his favorite bands 
When it comes to music, culture, and overall coverage of meaningful entertainment, Paste is where it's at. Fairly a new publication (starting in July of 2002), the magazine has soared in popularity and holds its own in a marketplace saturated with bland and repetitive articles. If you're sick of reading magazines that only focus on mainstream trends, surface culture, and the next teenage sensation, then this is your magazine. The publication focuses on a wide array of music, but emphasizes the folk, indie-rock, and alternative genres. In its pages you'll find very useful album reviews, articles on an array of films (especially indie ones, which are hard to come by these days), as well as book suggestions. But by far the best part of the magazine is that every issue includes a Sampler CD, which can include anything from short films, new music, and/or documentaries. Paste prides itself on catering to its consumer and is the perfect reading material for anyone who still enjoys stumbling onto new music, learning and growing in their song crafting, and keeping up with good quality... not quantity. The magazine blatantly states that it looks for "signs of life in music, film, culture..." and if you find yourself looking for the same, then you'll definitely find satisfaction with Paste magazine. Never a bland issue. Never gets old. Always interesting 
PASTE magazine was made just for me! I don't even know how it came to be...I had started to receive the now-defunct TRACKS magazine (unsolicited - - probably a last-ditch effort to build a subscriber base) and when they finally went under, I was credited with two issues of PASTE. WOW! This magazine is utterly awesome! Besides the cd (or dvd - - or sometimes both!), the music, the films, the cultural issues are all enlightening and well-written. It is obviously a labor of love for all those involved in its creation. It is literally chock-full of interesting stuff, particularly not-necessarily-mainstream stuff. In all honesty, I find the advertisements particularly helpful in turning me on to new great artists, which I probably would not have heard of otherwise. I also appreciate the thicker-than-average cover, since I tend to carry it around with me for a while, to devour it by bits and pieces in every spare moment. Each issue ends up plastered with sticky-note reminders to check out or follow-up on something or other, and I've even resorted to folding over pages of interesting articles for later reference. The magazine holds up very well to my attentive abuse. So, if you are ready to escape the pablum that the entertainment industry has been spoon-feeding you for so very long, be sure to check out PASTE. Support real artists, you won't be disappointed 
Absolutely love this magazine. So much, I gave it as gifts to my family. Perfect for music fans tired of the same old Top 40 radio and craving for some fresh new sounds. Each isssue even comes with a compilation CD and DVD of movie shorts, videos, etc. Sometimes I feel this was created just for me 
As an aging,53,appreciator of music,I find Paste to be a welcome read every time it shows up in my mailbox.Granted- I do not know every artist mentioned in the magazine nor do I care to, but the artists I do follow are treated with respect and with a sense of genuine interest! The CD that comes with the magazine will help you decide beforehand whether or not to purchase that Winterpills or Eddie Spaghetti CD!As previously mentioned,in another review, the print can be small and my reading glasses are always nearby! Gre 
I've been subscribing to Paste for over a year now, and it's a great magazine. I agree with what others have said about the writing: the interviewers often seem in love with their subjects and deal with the musicians as fans instead of as journalists. There are tons of reviews in each issue on a wide variety of bands and music, and the sampler CD and DVD are worth the subscription price all by themselves. It's a great way to listen to bands that you would never have heard otherwise. If you love music and are spending a small fortune on CDs, this magazine is for you. My only real criticism of the magazine is that it is very text heavy, with tons of small print jammed onto each page, often with a background picture/design behind the words, which makes it a chore to read. I would love to see larger print and less eye junk on the pages. Then again, I'm closing in on 40 so younger eyes may not find it as problematic 
This is my #1 favorite decor magazine. It's full of very creative ways to decorate with antique furniture and linens. The end result is classy and ecletic and something everyone could do. 
One of my FAVORITE Magazines! I would'nt live w/ out it! Thanx! Artchalet @ msn.co 
Although it has a lot of advertising, it is an informative magazine and gives helpful info about decorating in the country style 
Even when I lived in the city - yearning to be in the country - I loved this magazine! As a matter of fact I just picked up 12 year old copies at a yard sale this summer and the articles, recipes and tips are just as valuable today as they were back then! While other magazines get leafed through from friends and visitors to our home, Country Living always seems to get well worn, well actually devoured is likely a better word! Even my 12 year old reads it 
I like the different projects and items you can buy - plus they give prices and online addresses. Overall I'm quite pleased with this magazine 
An outstanding magazine even if all you wish to do is look at the pictures. Great ideas and for a great price 
That's what J-14 stands for. It's for teens pretty much yes. If you like gossip, posters, and info on your favorite celebs, music,and movies. I just started collecting them last September and I think their good. I don't care abou the gossip that much but I like the rest of it. I'm sick of seeing those kids off of High School Musical though. I wish they would take them out of the magazine. Especially Zac Efron...blech. Their good magazines though 
i think j-14 is a really good magazine if u like to hear the latest gossip about all your favourite celebrity's, or if u like to get nice posters of all the hot celebrity's, or even if u like to take those quizes to find out lots of neat different things!! i recomend this magazine to anyone who likes either of those things 
This is a very cool magazine!! You won't regret ordering it!! In every issue you get awsome pin-ups of your fave stars, celeb info,plus hair and make-up tips!!! What's not to love about that !!! Ignore all the one star comments!!! I'm 12 and this mag TOTALLY has what I want!!!!! Your teen daughter will too! To any of the people who gave this magazine a poor rating: Maybe the REAL "superficial" morans are people who can't respect others opions- not everyone dislikes this magazine like you do! 
Interview is a small magazine with big ambitions. All the latest news in entertainment, fashion, and politics can be found within it's colorful pages. The photography is amazing, and grand in scale, although the magazine is packed full of ads (which are equally as colorful I might add). This is NOT entertainment weekly- Interview is the indi-film of magazines, and the people and films it covers are not usually those found in typical magazines. Instead of focusing on the actor du jour, Interview covers the up coming, the soon to be, and the undiscovered. The interview formats are fascenating and unique, as most are done by celebrities, of celebrities. If one is looking for typical hollywood gossip, Warhol's masterpiece is not for them. At such a cheap price, Interview is a gem that is yet undiscovered by many. I highly recommend it 
I know "Interview" has been around awhile, but I just recently got into it. In short, if you're into the arts, it's your magazine. It touches on music, movies, fashion, and everything inbetween. And often the interviews of celebrities are done by other celebs, like "Jim Jarmusch" doing a Q&amp;A with "The White Stripes", just like they're sitting in a room chatting, very casual. I like that. Also the photography is tops, and often takes up the whole page (good mini-posters). They're good about not exposing the same old people too, lots of fresh faces, usually cool. Hey, if it's good enough for "Andy Warhol", it can't be bad, huh 
This is *the* magazine dedicated to advanced topics on the Windows NT series (NT, 2000 and XP). As the most popular and one of the best operating systems, Windows NT series is incredibly complicated, and this magazine, issue after issue as well as on its cluttered website, gives you lots of detailed information. A lot of the contributors are respected programmers who really know Windows internals. You also get the "inside" view of Microsoft managers and developers from time to time. This is just one incredible resource for expert Windows uers. (After all, even an expert still has a lot to learn.) Now, this is going to make Amazon mad: if you subscribe on Windows IT Pro website, you save another $10 plus you get free access to their entire article archive 
This is THE magazine for Windows IT pros. I have been a reader of this magazine since it first appeared at Windows NT Magazine. Over time it has gotten thinner, but the articles are as informative as ever. 
Taking the reins from Erwin Knoll (R.I.P.), Mr. Rothschild has very ably continued the great work of progressive / left commentary and articles. A terrific publication. Check out www.progressive.org for timely updates on national goings-on 
I subscribe to a few magazines, most of which are somewhat longwinded and tedious. The progressive does not follow that path. It's also a very informative magazine. For example, in one article I learned the following items about Democrat John Kerry: (1) He gets a good bit of money from a telecommunications industry's lobbyist "Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo". (2) "He has sponsored legislation to help telecommunications companies buy up the public airwaves." (3) He thinks "we should all have `smart cards' - electronic IDs with our health history encoded on them." (4) He "has voted for every free trade pact to come his way in the Senate since the Cold War." (5) AFL-CIO is backing Kerry even though he declined to answer there questionnaire on trade. All of these came from one article: "Triumph of the Bland" by Ruth Conniff (page 12-13 in issue April 2004). If your like informative information, check out this magazine 
This is a great magazine. As a liberal I find every month full of socialist articles. Great publication 
As a freelance graphic designer only 6 months out of school, I would recommend this magazine to anyone else who is in the same boat. Not only does this magazine site books that may help designers, but it also gives advice on what works - the profiles of top design studios would give anyone ideas on what they need to do to keep business flowing. I come from an entire family of designers, illustrators and art directors, all whom love Communication Arts - but that one is far too boring for me. HOW is more exciting, and for only $30, it is at a very reasonable price 
... I highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry. I have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas, reference, or to simply get those creative juices flowing. HOW's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship. HOW does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business 
This magazine really fills the voids that design school leaves behind. I have developed some serious guts in fighting for what I am worth due to this publication. When you are a new designer, you get taken advantage of frequently. College did not prepare me to stand up for myself in this competitive market, and this magazine not only keeps you up-to-date with the latest in the design realm, but also serves as a gutsy, motivational read as well. This is a must have subscription for budding designers. What a relief to read a killer design publication from the midwest 
There are different types of film magazines. Many are how-to's. Others just give the same blurbs over and over and rehashed and rehashed. This magazine uniquely targets a specific era when this short of films was at there best with a few exceptions due to today's capabilities. The magazine will take only a hand full of topics or subjects and have a full spread on them. This magazine is more of a filmography or a focused biography that just happens to be in magazine form. The accompanying black and white photos are relevant to the subject at hand. Just one of the articles would pay for the whole magazine. 
I'm happy that I ordered a subscription to this magazine as it not only matches, but surpasses the content provided in the Foreign Affairs Journal. The student discount rate I received (at the official foreign policy website) has the most reasonable price. Each new issue of FP contains a barrage of perspectives on numerous topics that are very relevant today. Photos, graphs, and charts also help to breathe life into each article and helped me to better grasp the content presented. This content is also available to subscribers online, with the addition of "web exclusives" and a "FP Blog." I haven't been this happy with a magazine subscription since I first subscribed to The Economist. Well worth the investment of time and money required to read each and every article as it acts as an outstanding supplement to anyone's current subscription to The Economist or Foreign Affairs Journal. Like myself, you won't be disappointed 
Very interesting and enjoyable to read. As a student of political science and international relations, this is a great way to keep updated about the current issues and problems in the international arena. It is not dry or boring. 
Foreign Policy is a terrific journal. It goes beyond the conventional wisdom in an effective manner: Topics are well-chosen; orientation is not as predictable as New Republic or tendentious as an academic journal. Good links and bibliography. Stimulating arguments and perspectives. I enjoy it; recommend it; and often give subscriptions to friends 
This magazine provides interesting stories and information about American history and cultural life. Most often it is very pleasant reading. 
American Heritage is a fine magazine brought to us by the same publishers who bring us Forbes Magazine. It is a magazine that examines history in all shapes and forms, examining past events and cultural changes that have shaped the American nation. One thing about this magazine that you will notice right away is that it is not just a magazine about American political history or the type of history that you remember from your school days. It does talk about this type of history, but it also includes stories about music, art, and other topics, breaking them apart and explaining how and why things happened the way they did and how they compare to the present. It also points out facts from the past that are more obscure, making for some very stimulating reading. Current events are also covered in this magazine, and in these instances, American Heritage discusses present- day phenomena from an intellectual and critical standpoint, often comparing it to similar events in the American past. This helps to keep the magazine current and more in- tune with important issues of the day. History buffs will love this magazine, and so will those of an intellectual persuasion. The articles here are more thoughtful than other magazines and many of them require greater concentration. For these reasons, American Heritage is not really a casual reading type of publication. It is intended for those who like to read, think, discuss, and debate. It's one of my favorite magazines of its kind on the market today. 
I am "historically impaired". I enjoy hearing "stories" from our past but I can never remember who did what, when. Therefore I don't usually make time for history. Enter "American Heritage" magazine. It is not a tired old rag about the Revolutionary War or who was the best Civil War general. No, it is a magazine full of lively articles on UNUSUAL facts from our history. Get this magazine and get the scoop on the flu that killed a million, the fascinating story of a secret mountain masacre or the plan to play God by cleansing the "feeble minded". Who knew!!

I've been a P subscriber and reader (even when not a subscriber) for years. I've also tried various other writers' magazines, such as The Writer and Writer's Digest. The latter two were fine when I was just beginning to dip into the freelance market, just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts, but when I gained more experience, I soon realized those just didn't make the cut anymore. The articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that I was no longer gaining new insights. P was the next step up. P provides advice, inspiration, informative interviews, current resources for the more experienced and discriminating writer. The bimonthly issues include articles, detailed listings of markets, contests, grants, and helpful, relevant ads. For the price, this is the best magazine available today for the writer who has a portfolio already underway and keeping an ear to the ground for more, staying up to date with what's rumbling in the literary world. With its up-to-date information, I've been able to leave the others aside, including that old bible, Writer's Market, which was, unfortunately, obsolete the moment it was off the presses. Highly recommended for the writer wanting more. 
This review refers to "Writer's Digest" Magazine Subscription... I renewed my subscription to WD magazine late this time around, and had withdrawal symptoms for the two months I went without. This is a fabulous periodical for all writer's, especially for those hoping to be published. The Magazine is chock full of helpful articles to point you in the "write" direction. Newly published Authors are interviewed and share their experiences and secrets. Every month there will be some kind of grammar(not my strong suit) or spelling quiz, that may seem easy to some, but may also come in real handy some day. Tips for writing the query letter that will get noticed by editors,words of wisdom from editors and publishers letting you know what they are looking for(and what not to do as well), monthly writing "assignments"(these make great warmers for the blocked writer)that you can send in for a possible prize,and advice for both fiction and non-fiction is abundant. WD will answer the gazillion questions you have. Should you use a Print On Demand? How to tell the good from the bad. Finding a good and honest agent.How to spot a fraud! What to look for when signing a contract.Advice for the writer of every age and every genre. They always seem to know the questions I have. Each month in "Pitch This Niche" a list of publishers looking for specialty articles or books can be found(could be anything from travel to video game articles), and in "The Markets" you'll find Trade magazines, book publishers, agents, contests for a variety of styles. You'll find out what they want(fiction, non-fiction, number of words etc), and how to submit you manuscripts to them.There is something for everyone. I have found this section most helpful. Everything, even all of the ads are geared toward the writer. Added to WD's own annual writing contests, which has many categories to enter in, you will find other contests that may interest you.Websites to share experiences with other writers are listed, ads for self-publishing, for workshops, and of course books about writing are to be found as well. I'm always happy to see my WD in my mailbox. It's always on time, and the subscription price here is better then the one I pay from the kids who come around selling magazines. I read it cover to cover, and have a hard time throwing even the really old ones away. Whether you are writing a mystery,a book of poems, a spiritual essay,a screenplay, or an article for your favorite magazine, this a treasure chest of useful info for the aspiring writer, and it is quite motivating as well. Write On!....Laurie 
I don't subscribe to many writing magazines, but Writer's Digest is one I subscribe to. It's packed full of useful information for the novelist, short story writer, poet, or freelancer. Writer's Digest has helped me to learn the craft of fiction writing, and the articles here are the best you'll find anywhere. Subscribe to this awesome mag. You won't regret it.

I call Writer's Digest a writing tool because for years many writers have relied upon the information given within the pages of this thin monthly magazine. As soon as I began writing I started buying this magazine and reading it with a highlighter close at hand. It provides information for all corners of the writing industry, whether it's from starting a story to selling an article to doing the taxes at the end of the year; everything here is geared toward making a writer's life just a bit easier (and for those of you who are attempting this as career, you know just how important something like this could be). To add to that, there are a lot of inspirational articles and sections that can give a young writer the push needed to get writing. So, to anyone interested in writing of any form (fiction or non-fiction) then this should be your first step into the field (followed by some education, of course). Writer's Digest to me is almost as important as my Word Processor or dictionary. 
I look forward to recieving my magazine every month. I really love this magazine. It has articles, marriage, sex, women's lives, etc. I don't know why the others didn't enjoy it. 
I really like this magazine, even if its a woman's magazine. Often I find these types of magazines filled with advertisements and articles that never seem to fit a real persons every day life. This magazine features a nice cross section of information on fashion, decorating, cooking, and relationships. I always find something interesting to read in here 
I really like the fact that the publishers really listen to their readers. Every year (or is it twice a year?) there is a survey included in the magazine for people to give their opinions about articles they enjoy and those they would rather do without. I've been reading this for the past 2 years at my local bookstore (and finally subscribed earlier this year). I've seen an improvement not only in the magazine's layout, but in the content as well. I really like how there are "sections" on personal well-being, fashion, motherhood, etc. Since I'm not a parent (yet), I can easily skip over the motherhood section. Because of the layout, it's not hard to flip through and find what I'm looking for 
I get a magazine every month and I have to say Redbook has gripping stories, and amazing deals. I bought my first copy of Redbook in August of this year and lets just say I wasted no time sending off for my subscription. I look forward to recieving my magazine every month and if you haven't signed up already... your missing out!! 
American Girl magazine is geared to girls aged 7-13. Much younger than that and many girls aren't reading at the appropriate level yet. Much older and they may be ready to move on. But honestly I'm surprised to read so many reviews by 10 or 11 year old girls who feel they're too old for this magazine. I don't believe girls that age NEED magazines based solely on makeup tricks, flirting with boys, etc. AG has articles such as dealing with relationships with friends. Like when you and your best friend start to grow apart. Or when she moves away. Articles like one about a girl whose family travels around the world on their sailboat for two years. Crafts that you can actually be proud to give at the age of 10. Several reviewer have complained that the magazine is short and expensive. It is. But here's why: there is NO advertising (short of anything American Girl related). In many magazines, advertising accounts for easily half the pages. And advertising enables publishers to sell magazines for a low cost. AG has no advertising and so has to charge a fair price to produce it. I'm more than willing to pay for that kind of publication. Parents ordering for your daughters, you know your girl. If you've got a 10 year old going on 16, this may not be for your child. If you have a precocious 6 year old, she might like it as well. AG is the kind of magazine I'm glad my daughters enjoy 
I have been subscribing to American Girl magazine since I was nine or so, and I am now thirteen. Here are the Pros and Cons : Pros: -Appropriate for younger children -No advertisements! -Has section on fun and unique crafts -Fun quizzes -Advice on frendships in basically ever issue Cons: -Way too expensive ($4.77 for one issue? Please) -Usually less than 60 pages -Only comes out every other month -Should have at least a little bit on fashion, though it sometimes has hair ideas Overall, this magazine is perfect for ages 8-12, but I feel like I am getting a little too old for it. You may like "Discovery Girls", which is basically the same thing as American Girl, but has some stuff on fashion and has more pages 
I've been checking this out for years. I love the paper stock, very high quality and bound well - they're almost like books. The photography is uniformly excellent and the graphical design is terrific. This is the kind of magazine that makes long trips via airline more tolerable. It's packed with information. HOWEVER, there is one subject they never broach, and it is to their detriment - I'm talkin' 'bout ANAL SEX. You never see questions or articles about it. I suspect it is avoided so as not to offend certain markets, to be able to have the widest distribution possible. It's just funny. In any event, it's still worth looking at even if it is referred to as the male "Cosmo", or the "straight man's gay porn" 
You can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. In the issue in front of me, they flog the Lincoln MKZ, Range Rover Sport, and Audi A6. There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55. Well, 52 maybe. But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH. It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs. To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS. In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, where there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you. Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either. I kind of like it 
My brother dismissed magazines such as "Men's Health", due to an errant assumption that such publications were not for typical suburban Dads like him. A heart attack and quad bypass later, he changed his mind! I bought him a subscripton to enjoy during his recovery, and he has really gotten a lot out of it. It's not glossy "fluff"; it actually has stuff he reads and uses each month. This is one subscription that is worth every penny 
A monthly journal (10 issues annually) established almost 25 years ago, THE NEW CRITERION has covered the world of the cultured arts with a keenly critical eye, disposed towards high artistic standards and sound moral judgments. Delightfully un-PC, its critical stance remains unmitigatedly harsh towards the often flaccid and self-satisfied artistic endeavors of "post-modernity" and the sanctimonious aires of radicalized professors blighting the universities. Yet, for all of the (largely justified) editorial spleen, THE NEW CRITERION's virtues are located in the variety of outstanding contributors. In the literary field alone, luminaries such Joseph Epstein, John Simon, Guy Davenport and Christopher Ricks have graced the pages of THE NEW CRITERION ( whose title alludes to, and takes up the mantle of, T.S. Eliot's "CRITERION", 1920-39 ). There is an admirable aesthetic evident in THE NEW CRITERION's visual layout, unchanged for many years, the cover featuring the journal title with the date and table of contents of the particular issue located directly below. Mercifully, the font used for essays is both pleasing to, and easy on, the eyes. Based in a bustlingly artistic city (Manhattan), THE NEW CRITERION takes advantage of its location to survey the world of theater, art and music. Particular critics are deployed in the aforementioned "departments", a move that allows one to glean consistency in point of view (agree or disagree as one may). Mark Steyn is often devastatingly funny in his theater reviews (one can easily imagine impresario's cringing at the prospect of his notices) and classical music critic Jay Nordlinger ("New York Chronicle") is admirably forthright in rendering opinions devoid of equivocation. Poetry, from famous and unknown writers, is regularly featured in THE NEW CRITERION (new executive editor, David Yezzi, is a well respected poet and critic). Symposiums on various cultural/political issues, with contributions from learned panelists, are arranged once or twice a year. Book reviews, undertaken by various (commissioned) writers, are reliably informative, often a spur to read more than just the subject under review. Despite its "conservative" label, most of THE NEW CRITERION's contributors display little of their political beliefs. In fact, many contributors could quite easily be referred to as "liberal", in one or another of the aspects that protean word admits ( such permutations are just as easily applicable to "conservative", lately quite a supple term, readily conducive to metamorphosis according to agenda ). However, the editorial perspectives of Hilton Kramer and Roger Kimball do, lamentably, fit within a general pattern of thought one could label "neo-conservatism", especially as regards their support of the Bush administration and its "war on terror". It pains me to mention this Achilles Heel, especially out of the respect due to Mr. Kimball, whose wide-ranging essays have displayed moral as well as literary acumen. How can an admirer of George Santayana and T.S. Eliot be so blind to the hubristic foolishness ( nay, immorality ) of this foreign policy disaster? When Mr. Kimball (no fan of the Jacobin or Bolshevik revolutions) defends the Bush administration, he endorses ideological premises clearly related to those diabolic social experiments: military adventurism in the name of global democratic revolution ( freeing the world from tyranny; igniting "fire in the minds of men" ). Evidently, Mr. Kimball associates opposition to this war with the counter-cultural movement of the 1960's. While anyone of sense would deplore the excesses of that epoch, it is clear that the problems which have ignited the current conflagration have roots in something more substantial than Ginsberg, Haight-Ashbury and "soixante-huitards". To be fair, THE NEW CRITERION, more than any truly neo-conservative publication, does invite writers (Roger Scruton, RJ Stove, et al) with differing perspectives; this redeems the journal from the monomaniacal, stultifying tendencies exhibited in COMMENTARY or THE WEEKLY STANDARD. Nevertheless, mistakes and all, THE NEW CRITERION, in terms of sheer quality and comprehensiveness, remains a vital and impassioned advocate of high culture. In doing so, it does honor to the memory of the journal ( and *its* editor ) that inspired it. High criteria indeed. 
If you enjoy politics, TV, museums, art all the gifts of the enlightenment, the open society, and the liberty we all enjoy --- spare no expense get this product. 10 issues per year (off jul/aug). The -oh so sophisticated- people who run the universities/networks/opinion mags do not get it right all the time. Want to know why how ? I really can't wait for the first week of the month when a new issue shows up. I love this gem have for 3 years + now 
i like getting good stuf in the mail and one day i received this mag from my grandma and i really enjoyed it, seeing as i had just enter hi skool and there we TONS of things i wasnt real sure on...however my mom discontinued it, saying i was too young for it...many reviewers say this, so i will say what many of them fail to specify: This magazine is geared more for girls who have entered the high-school, teenager period, and deals ALOT with makeup and boys, a bit of fashion, and keeping close to your friends. i will take a stab at saying its mostly for teens, if not for the younger ones, ages 15 and up...but realy, dating and makeup are things a girls will decide on when shes ready...i have neither dated, nor wore makeup, and im an older girl, and the ONLY reason i am more interested in boys and trying to put on eyeshadow is age-curiousity...the mag has not affected me in any way...except provide a few hours worth of reading and quiz-taking, plus help on everyday worries (ie, body, social probs, and so forth) great mag if you know you have a mature daughter who doesnt change overnite to please people at skool...age isnt the real big issue if u are maturer (15 and up, or have just matured 5x faster than most girls ur age) and want a mag that is more real life than just made up stories (they have a fiction section), more diverse girls (all kinds of body types and ethnicities), and all around more mature theme, pick up Seventeen...its a great mag, but parents beware...is talks about sex and has real life stories that can be very disturbing...just to warn u...my rents didnt realy like it, but if ur well rounded and have good morals, u realy need not worry... see y 
Road and Track is like the tortise and the hare. It doesn't move with lighting speed from trend to trend as some other publications. But its slow and methodical evolution yeilds a contemporary classic. It's format and photography are faultless. The editorials are engaging, particularly Peter Egan's. And no one can match the prowess of technical editor Dennis Semantis. Quite possibly the best automotive magazine in the industry 
Road Track is arguably the best automotive magazine out there. It has the best photography, and covers a wide range of intriguing cars. It provides excellent coverage of the latest from Ferarri and Porche, along with great articles on classic race cars. Where R slacks, however, is on its coverage of every day cars. Your not going to find too much about the Ford Focus in this magazine. If you are looking for a magazine to learn about the standard cars on the auto market, go for Motor Trend, but if you are looking for a magazine that covers exotic cars the car-lovers way, this is the magazine for yo 
Like everyone else, I have read them all over the last 15-20 years. But Road Track is the one that I have consistently subscribed to over that time. RT offers the least biased, most informative articles and comparisons out there. Car and Driver on the other hand, seems heavily biased towards Honda and BMW (I call it the Lemming Factor) and their comparisons are overly subjective. RT's format, photography and writing are 2nd to none and the monthly columns and auto news bits are entertaining 
Road and Track is different than most car enthusiast magazines. Not only does it spend time on the cars of today, it also has articles on vintage models and racecars. I have found that Road and Track goes much more in depth than others, rewarding the reader. However, if you do not like performance cars look for something els 
I have subscribed to this colorful, useful little magazine since issue #1. I just used the last issue to prepare my family's Thanksgiving dinner, which was easy, quick and delicious (well, that's what everyone said). You can see a photo in the customer image section above. You can see the turkey, the cranberry compote, the brussels sprouts, the mashed potatoes and the pecan pie - all made from recipes in the magazine. Every issue is well-organized with main courses, side dishes, desserts, and special focuses. Issue 38, the one I just received for December, has features on shallots, pomegranates, holiday cookies, vanilla, and liquid measuring cups. Each recipe is designed to be quick (usually under 30 minutes), has nutritional information, and is well-organized to help you get the job done. Just to let you know, I'm a 60-year-old man, I have never read anything else by or associated with Martha Stewart, I have never watched her on TV, and I started to enjoy cooking more after I started reading this magazine. And kudos to Brandon Hansen, another reviewer, who found a much-needed index to these volumes at the omninerd web site (and even more kudos to the person who did the index). Just do a search for "everyday food" at that site." 
In recent years, Get Martha Stewart has become one of our nation's pastimes. From the feds to hamstrung kitchenistas, all have lined up for a piece of this nouveau icon and is it really a surprise? The backlash had been building for some time--weary were the legions of housewives and gay men unable to keep pace with the exacting standards set forth on her morning show, and the seeming mountains of magazines and how-to books. When the queen of household perfection went to jail, a collective sigh echoed throughout the land.  All the bad publicity obscured the fact that in 2003 her company launched a new publication called Everyday Food. Difficult to recognize as a stepchild of Martha Stewart Living--on early issues, her name appears in the magazine world's version of fine print--it literally snuck onto newsstands with barely a whimper. It's a shame because this slip of a magazine is the antithesis of the glossy tome that filled many a reader with apoplexy. Everyday Food accomplishes something I never thought I'd see: a recipe book that's actually useful, presenting delicious dishes that for the most part, are do-able no matter how late you get home from the office. Rarely do they require an excess of time, or ingredients that have to be shipped from in Timbuktu. The layout is gloriously simple. A glance at the table of contents reveals five sections: pasta, more main dishes, sides and dessert. The variable fifth part might include suggestions on light meals, using the seasons as a guide--for instance, soups and stews get showcased in winter, while in summer attention turns to salads and seasonal vegetables. For time challenged people who love to cook, the biggest revelation is the minimum prep. While no one can rival Martha for organization--yes, most of your chopping can be done while you wait for the water to boil--some of these dishes actually come in under time, like the creamy polenta. Watching those calories? I discovered dishes requiring olive oil or butter could be made with the recommended portions of fat reduced, like the shrimp with garlic and lemon. Unlike a lot of recipes, these don't suffer terribly if you're missing an ingredient or two. Sautï¿½ed Broccoli Rabe is nice with the toasted pine nuts, but if they're not readily available, the other ingredients (lemon zest, salt and pepper) provide plenty of potent flavors. Culinary techniques and housekeeping get their due (the cult of Martha isn't entirely dead). Sprinkled throughout the booklets are informative pages on ingredients and equipment care (the section's title phrase, "What is it?" has become a buzzword in our household) that will benefit even the seasoned cook. If you think couscous is a clever name for someone's poodle, a page covering the grades and methods of preparation will put you in the know, while a primer on vinaigrettes got me out of my salad dressing rut, inspiring me to incorporate unconventional ingredients (cinnamon works great as a pepper substitute). I was grateful for the tips on wrought iron skillet care (coarse salt as a cleaning agent-who knew?), and you'll swear that your mother wrote the section on how to achieve perfect egg whites. Everyday Food isn't perfect - included are time-eating wrestling matches with phyllo dough, and a recipe for chicken enchiladas made with corn tortillas that is a mini opera (could someone tell me how to keep the tortillas from breaking when you roll them?). The Martha of old also lives in the baking sections; Brownie Hearts and Brownie Bites are classic examples of an idea overworked - this type of food engineering telegraphs that we're un-chic philistines to settle for a simple tray of brownies cut in squares. Thankfully most of Everyday Food is free of such excess. Humbled by her recent experiences, maybe Martha is finally thinking about the little people. And that's a good thing. 
Our growing row of Everyday Food issues has the potential to become an extremely resourceful cooking library, but where is the card catelogue? If I want to find a particular recipe or a new recipe that I can make with a particular ingredient, I'd have to flip through hundreds of pages. Luckily, I located a downloadable Everyday Food Index at OmniNerd.com. When used together, the magazine and Index truly make something that can be used effectively everyday 
I subscribed to Everyday Food on a whim and am so glad I did. Fresh, seasonal recipes, also very well illustrated and documented recipes, not to mention easy! I subscribe to other "higher end" cooking magazines, but find myself always grabbing this one to sort through first. The recipes (typically) will not be complicated for most and will not require an ingredient that most Americans cannot find (which I find so refreshing!). If you are a novice or experienced chef, any home cook could benefit from this magazine. Now, if ya'll would excuse me, I have some cranberry scones in the oven (from this magazine, of course! 
This magazine has really blown me away. I wish there was some way to measure the amount of time it has saved me in the kitchen! I bought it at first because of the master shopping list in the front which allows me to stock up my pantry and freezer at the start of each month and then make smaller trips for each weeks' worth of food. I like the Have You Tried? feature which helps me introduce new foods to my husband and toddlers. I really like how the recipes are designed to use the same ingredient several times... I'm not left with 3/4 cup of some odd condiment which will sit in my fridge for a year and then get thrown out. I absolutely love the meal index; I check off each recipe as I make it which allows me to glance at the overall picture of our diet and see if I have given my family enough variety of different meats and vegetarian entrees. There are side dishes, after school snacks, breakfast ideas, a microwave recipe, a freezer recipe... they really have taken the time to cover all bases. In fact, in just a few short months it has gotten to the point where this magazine is all I cook from. My cookbooks are gathering dust :-) It has simplified my life to such an extent that when my mother called to see if I would bring a dessert to a family party, I grabbed the magazine and read her the list of 6 recipes. We picked one that would be easy to make and transport. It was a lot easier than brainstorming what to choose out of the hundreds of desserts one could possibly make. I like that the recipe is all on one page - I attach it to my range hood with a magnetic clip and everything is easy to read but out of the way, not getting food spilled on it. I also love the size which fits perfectly in my handbag and in a Ziploc bag once the month is over. I put the magazine pages for each issue in a bag with the index on top and when my husband asks about a recipe, I can easily glance at each one until I find the dish he wants. And I'll tell you another thing... many of the dishes contain salt and pepper and maybe one other spice. The food is light and fresh tasting and delicious. In fact, since I throw out my jarred spices after one year and replace them, my pantry shelf is down to just a handful because that's all that are called for in the magazine. This magazine has saved me a TON of money. Not to mention time! My kids are 3, 1 1/2 and 6 months and this magazine has been a lifesaver in every way. The cooking techniques are so easy that I can often prepare dinner with my oldest daughter, which she loves. And I love that I am in and out of the kitchen quickly (most recipes I have found are less than 30 minutes) and I am enjoying my time in there more than ever. In fact, I even have the energy most nights to clean up the kitchen after I'm done :-) I could go on and on but the most salient point is this: I feel healthier cooking from this magazine. My fridge is packed with produce like it never was before! I'm actually proud of the food I feed my family and that is worth every cent I've paid for this subscription and then some. 
I never subscribe to anything! This magazine is great. There are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes. I'm on a health kick right now and find most cooking magazines aren't that useful to me. I might enjoy reading them but I don't actually use their recipes. I've made 4 of the recipes out of this last Everyday Food issue and they were very healthy (lots of veggies, chicken, brown rice, salmon etc.) tasted really good, and were also fast which is a bonus for me. I'd give this magazine 10 stars if I could :- 
I have looked at many photography magazines - many of them are just filled with ads....not what an amateur is looking for. I wanted indepth articles, helpful tips and information to help me improve my craft. I found it here. I read every issue cover to cover and back again. I find helpful information in every issue. I highly recommend this magazine - even if you aren't purely an "outdoor" photographer 
We tried this for a short term, wondering if it would come on the day it was supposed to, so far so good, missed one day being on time, Snow Storm. My husband enjoys this paper, now he doesn't have to go to the store to get it and find out they are out, by noon he has todays issue. Very Pleased 
Scoffed at by journalism purists when it first came out, USA Today is great for what it is: a fast,colorful easy-to-read summary of national news.This is the trendsetter that changed the look of american newspapers 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS makes no apology for its antiquated typescript, large print, and generally stodgy appearance. It hardly needs to. It is simply one of the consistently finest sources of foreign policy discussion available from an American (thus *foreign* policy means USA vis-ï¿½-vis the world) point of view. The design folks have correctly discerned that toying with appearances could only interfere with a train that rolls just fine as it is. FA is often the vehicle of choice for American foreign policy officers who have moved on to think tanks and other private sector roles. For example, see the Richard Holbrooke (he of the Dayton Accords) piece entitled 'Liberalism and Foreign Policy' in the most recent (July/August 2006) issue available to this reviewer. The voice most often heard in FA is decidely that of the Washington establishment, broadly defined. Yet the editors occasionally toss in a dissenting viewpoint like that of Hugo Chï¿½vez' Ambassador to the US ('A Benign Revolution: In Defense of Hugo Chï¿½vez', July/August 2006) for color. The writing is well informed and superbly edited. Roundtable discussions on issues of concern are common, as are themed issues. Again from the recent issue, the topic 'The Rise of India' provides space for four essays entitled 'Unshackling the Economy', 'India's Global Strategy', 'America's New Partner?', and 'The Kashmir Conundrum'. FA's genius lies in that the globe's foreign policy experts will have digested these contributions with great care, yet the business traveler on her first trip to India can easily do the same on the first flight of her journey. Such is the quality of FA's editorial work. Long-time readers often discern an editorial drift to the right or the left, a perception that may owe as much to the changing currents of international affairs and the constantly moving matrix in which any statement must be written and read as to any real shift in the journal's political leanings. FOREIGN AFFAIRS is a must read for career internationalists, a worthwhile educational tool for those who want to know what America's brightest (thought not always most in touch with facts on the ground) policy makers are thinking, and a diversion for hobbyists whose curiosity regularly yanks them tornado-like out of Kansas 
I've been reading Foreign Affairs since 1980 and have always admired the well rounded scope covering everything from Social Cultural issues, Media/Public Opinion, International law, Human rights, Economics, Trade Finance, Science Technology, Intelligence, Energy, resources environment, International organizations, and the list goes on. What I love most about this journal is that there is no agenda - the journalism is highly ethical and thorough. You'll also find out about great new books. I've loved and studied International Relations since 1980, and this is the one magazine that has never let me down. Its coverage is the pinnacle in print journalism. Deserves 10 stars! 
This magazine is written by many of the most influential people in the realm of foreign policy. If one wishes to know what the Establishment thinks on foreign policy issues this is the magazine to read. But I have often found it to err in its judgment and evaluation of situations. A most recent example is a recent long analysis of U.S. - Iranian relations in which the experts led by Zbigniew Brezhinski posited that Iran would be open to conciliatory economic gestures to the U.S. in relation to its nuclear program. This analysis was so far of the mark , so naive, so uninformed as to what the Iraniians were saying to their own people publicly and in the mullah to mullah conferences that I was astonished it had been printed and taken seriously. Since that time of course the uncompromising determination of Iran to attain nuclear weapons, its fanatic Anti- American policy has become clear for all to see. So my advice is that whoever reads 'Foreign Policy' on any major world program would do well to read many other sources as well. i.e. the reader approach that by reading 'Foreign Policy' one now knows about the world is simplistic, and most often, wrong 
I've been reading FA since 2001 and have found it to be consistently good. There are only six issues each year, so I have time to read it front to back each time. The articles are more in-depth than something you might read in the Economist or other weekly news magazine. This is not something you read for headlines, but something you read for issues. FA seems to me to be non-partisan. Condi Rice, Chuck Hagel, and Donald Rumsfeld get space to write, but so does Madeline Albright and Samuel Berger. Recent articles I liked: "How to Counter WMD" by Ashton B. Carter, "How to Stop Nuclear Terror" by Graham Allison, and "The Outsourcing Bogeyman" by Daniel W. Drezner 
 This is an excellent deep think magazine that is put out every two months with the best writers of Foreign Policy in the world writing articulate and current articles about the state of affairs of various countries, problem spots and emerging issues. Each issue contains fact full essays that give you an accurate state of affairs and makes you think globally about the situation in Iraq or any political hotspot. What are the long the term ramifications of our dealing with Iran, Russia and Venuzuela nationalizing oil etc.? If you don't know, this magazine's writers will give you the full view.   
I will give this publication five stars because it is one of the few magazines that has maintained its professional integrity without begging for a commercial outlook or seeking partisan funding. Foreign Affairs has so far offered the most relevant articles by the world's top experts and decision makers. For instance, Foreign Affairs was the first magazine to publish Samuel Huntington's article The Clash of Civilizations in the early 1990s. The article, which Huntington later developed and published in a book, proved to be one of the most controversial ones and provoked a debate that has been going on until the day these lines were written. The articles are more often than not comprehensive, simple and written by experts. This is not to say that all the published pieces are flawless. Yet, the articles are overall enlightening and a must-read for all those interested in world politics 
Over the last year, every issue of Foreign Affairs has been punctuated with significant essays from political and academic notables. The magazine also includes occasionally heated responses to previous essays and candid reviews of current books on international affairs. The publication frequently serves as a means for those aspiring to be in or recently pushed out of power in American government to express their views. Political figures such as Condeleeza Rice writing during the Clinton administration, former middle east envoy Dennis Ross (most recent issue), or Clinton National Security aid Strobe Talbot might fit into this category. Current executive or legislative eminences are much less frequent contributers - although Senator Chuck Hagel did provide a recent, but not especially enlightening, offering. There were a number of informative articles in the last two publications of the magazine. Each issue had one particularly worthwhile essay. For November/December Gal Luft and Anne Korin wrote about unarmed oil tankers, narrow, crowded and poorly guarded sea lanes and what steps terrorists may have already taken to position themselves to exploit these vulnerabilities. In the January/February issue Edward Luttwak presents the first persuasive argument I've seen for immediate disengagement from Iraq. He explains convincingly how a withdrawal coupled with extremely deft diplomacy might shift the burden of establishing a stable Iraqi government from the US to Iraq's neighbors and provide the added bonus of an improved US image in the Muslim world and continental Europe. Foreign Affairs is well worth the time of anyone who has an interest in becoming conversant with current political issues. 
The only magazine I read from cover to cover is Foreign Affairs, published by the distinguished bi-partisan Council on Foreign Relations. Ideas and issues presented in each issue are discussed six months later in the news. A recent example of this phenomenon is the publication of Daniel Yergin and Michael Stoppard's The Next Prize, about strategic issues surrounding the future of natural gas as an energy source. The article appeared in late 2003, and since then the concerns raised in the article have reverberated in business publications, energy conferences and Sunday talk shows.  Since my childhood I have thought of Foreign Affairs as an influential publication in leadership circles. Over a quarter century ago, I remember reading that Henry Kissinger promoted Daniel Patrick Moynihan as US Ambassador to the United Nations on the basis of an article he wrote in Foreign Affairs. As the founder of a company dedicated to cultural and business travel to Russia, I need to stay ahead of the knowledge curve with regards to the world, rather than just be informed of events. I find Foreign Affairs to be the single most valuable tool to stay informed about foreign policy, trends in world affairs, and current political thought. 
Yvette Linton-Smith and many other women can attest to the absolute love and passion as shown in his work of the desire and wanting of the female form. Mr. Da Silveira has no reason or motive to be with a woman other than the fact that he cares for the passion and friendship.

Sometimes the National Enquirer is the only place to find the true story about a subject - for example it broke the story about O. J.'s shoes. I guess you have to pick and choose your articles. Some of the articles, I admit, are useless. However, other articles are interesting and some you can't find anyplace else 
This is truly one of my favorite magazines! It's been a favorite gift for friends and I know that it is being passed to others so each issue gets multiple readings. Of course, my issues are safely in my home library since some things are too good to share 
I've been subscribing to mental_floss for about two years now, and still read every issue from cover to cover the same day it arrives. It's fun and light-hearted without being stupid, and touches on a wide range of topics. I've given several gift subscriptions, and most of the recipients liked it so much that they've renewed their subscriptions on their own 
MENTAL FLOSS provides some of the wittiest, entertaining, and might I say even thought provoking reading available today! It's a great way to start the day or to take a break from work, life, stress, dissertation writing, etc! When you need to laugh or go just "hmmmmmmmmmm...that's interesting", pick up MENTAL FLOSS 
I've been reading this magazine for years. It never fails to entertain me while it teaches me fascinating new things. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to feel smart again 
Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area. Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine. Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers. Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families. The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the "Currents" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price. Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel. Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans. Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more "unknown" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property. 
You don't have to live on the coast to enjoy this magazine, you only have to love it. "Coastal Living" is informative and enjoyable reading that covers everything from decorating a beach home to getting involved with environmental causes. From Alaska to Rhode Island,from Hawaii to Florida, and everyplace in between that has a coastline, you'll find well written articles on the best vacation spots,places of historical interest,great seafood recipes,architecture,saving the coastlines,travel and decorating tips. If you are a lover of beaches or boating,a sunworshiper or have a strong interest in the coastline, the price is right for a subscription. For those just looking for some ideas on travel or a few decorating tips, you may just want to pick one up from the newstand and check it out first.It is a good size periodical,with many articles and beautiful pictures, that will make you just want to pack up and head for the coast...any coast! Nice change of pace for the coffee table too....enjoy...Laurie 
W.. W is an excellent magazine (excellent + very big) Although i must say to ensure you dont want waste your money.. W isnt for everyone! This is such a good magazine though, i've being reading it for such a long time. And in my opinion every issue is worth it. Just to give you an idea of what W is all about..its about: *Amazing High Fashion spreads and fashion updates, etc etc *A Backstage pass into the lives of Americas High Society *Informative articles, offering opinions by the writer and the readers of the magazine *Amazing and very unique interviews of celebs and other upcoming people whos names will be very well-known in a very short time. Overall, if you like reading about High-Fashion, and the lives of the Rich and Famous and indulging in abit of luxury, then W is definetly the magazine for you. 
As an aspring graphic designer who is addicted to fashion, I have found this magazine to fulfill my needs. It's not the type of magazine that going to tell you which bathing suit works well for your "bum type." They are not interested in what the tabloids say about their featured actor/actress/model or whoever. It's more about having an slightly in-depth conversation. This is a magazine appropriate for those we a refined sense of fashion, satricial writing, feature writing and the many ebbs and flows of fashion "trends." Cosmopolitan as to can of Bud Light. W...savory this one with a glass of champagne. In the vary least a merlot 
W makes it clear what industry it serves, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to read and look at. It does have some interesting insight into the fashion business, such as a column on deals, mergers, CEO's, designers, new talent; plus there are photos from the runways in New York, Paris, and Milan. You can really see a designer's theme and imagination, and that is an art of a sort! The party photos are fun to see, because you can do your own "what not to wear" with some of the women pictured, who are trying as pathetically hard as we are in the sticks to make the most of what we've got. Interestingly, the articles usually do not gush over their celebrity topics (except Reese Witherspoon, and what's not to like?). There can be quite a tone of sarcasm when the subject warrants it. Of course, the product articles are pitched to sell the product, but you can still glean some hard information. And last but not least, the fashion photography can be compelling. Sometimes you're compelled to say "this is stupid" but you're compelled to look. One thing about W that keeps me subscribing: the prose may not be deathless, but it isn't breathless. (Pay attention, fashion editors 
this is a riot get the W it rocks! and email this to mom .my sister sent it to me 
What do fine dining, high fashion, celebrities, beauty tips, travel, exceptional photography, and entertainment all have in common? They can be found in W magazine. A magazine of women's interests, W is a huge publication measuring approximately 9" X 13". Which is one reason I like it, it's like getting a magazine from the 1940's with 21st century fashions. I would put it in the same category as Vogue. Anyone will love viewing W., but it's not hard to figure out who it's mainly aimed at, especially when you occasionally see jewelry priced between $20,000 and $200,000, and when you notice who some of the advertisers are, namely Prada, Calvin Klein, and Armani.W also has superb photography, photography that borders on Art. I have a subscription and share it with family and friends, then place it in my collection( I collect magazines ). If you like magazines such as Vogue and Harper's Bizarre, you are sure to love this fine publication 
I was never so bothered by ads. Other are, I guess. I found this magazine to be very good. My kids both loved and read and reread it. It has shorter articles in some parts which is great for those with limited attention. It also has interesting facts which is also great for boys who tend to like reading nonfiction. If you are the parent of a boy who doesn't like reading, see if your local library has this magazine and try it out on them. They just might like it. I teach ESL to newcomers in highschool, and I think I can bring my worn back issues to class for them to read. Frankly, I think the magazine is fine, and I would consider a subscription for my class 
WHY is almost everybody giving NG Kids a bad review? I LOVE NG Kids almost as much as i love Discovery Girls and i don't think it has THAT many ads. I have a 1 year subscription to NG Kids and a 2 year subscription to Discovery Girls. NG comes out once a month, DG twice a month. So i'll have twelve issues of NG in 1 year and 12 issues of DG in two years. Actually 13 because i ordered the Special Edition. 
Those arriving at this Amazon page doubtless have some interest in books. In reading the reviews I note some disappointment with the contents of the London Review. Maybe if I provide a brief summary of one issue you can decide whether or not this is the book mazazine for you. About fifty percent of the contributors to a current issue are PhD academics. Here is a sampling of the articles in this issue: 1. Writers, Readers, and Reputations: Literary Life in Britain 1870 to 1918. 2. A University of Chicago philosophy professor explores philosopher Alisdair McIntyre's conceps of truth and ethics as found in the recently released 2 volumes of McIntyres essays. 3. A review of Kostal's book "A Jurisprudence of Power:Victorian Empire and the Rule of Law". You like fiction? In this issue you'll find reviews of the books of novelists Edward St. Aubyn, and M.J. Hyland. There is also an article about the German author Gunter Grass who reveals in a book that he was a member of the Waffen SS during WWII. Unfamiliar authors? For me too. Next month though they will be reviewing American author Richard Ford's new novel. Now him I know. Rather than write a review of glowing praise or bleak condemnation I thought it best to simply tell you what's in it, and let you make up your own mind if this is the kind of book magazine you would like to read. Like the New York Review of Books you'll find a variety of articles that aren't about a book at all, and some books that are reviewed merely serve as a Hitchockian mcguffin for the reviewer to expand at length his opinions about the subject of the book. I suppose a hierarchy of book magazines in terms of sophistication might be Bookmarks for the everyday fiction reader (It's a good magazine, in my opinion), and then, a step above, the New York Times Review, on up to the New York Review of Books, and then at the top the London Review of Books. Mind you I am not categorizing these mags in terms of the quality of writing. They all are good. It's just that if you want to be able to enjoy all of the London Review's article it might help if you were a polymath. 
There is no comparing the incredibly honest reviews on Amazon with the high-brow reviews found in the LRB. One surveys average readers, and the other is the opinion of people who make a living writing about books. I, Brockeim, am more like the people than the professionals, and believes most of you are as well 
Dog Fancy is an excellent magazine for all parents of the furry four-legged tail waggin' love bugs out there. It is very informative and I, myself, refer to previous magazines all the time. It's your own personal library full of information that you can use now and even in the future. I've subscribed to Dog Fancy and Dog World. Dog World is for parents who are mainly in dog shows and agility. While Dog Fancy is for the average parent who is not in the sports realm. I love Dog Fancy magazine and I know that parents who love their "kids" as much as I love mine, will enjoy this magazine as much as I do. 
My mom used to subscribe to this magazine when I was growing up. I used to read it often throughout my adolesence. However I always found the magazine to be lacking. (Quality, Information.) Now some 10 years later I decided to try the magazine out once again. Since there has been some recent hype going around about it. I got this months newsstand -- April -- issue and the Special Puppy issue. I am in Love! It seems the Dog Fancy has improved by leaps and bounds since my last read. Now it contains an enormous ammount of extremely helpful information as well as stories and such to entertain you 
I have read Dog Fancy for a year now and I find it to be full of useful information for people that have a dog or thinking about getting a dog. The only problem that I have with it is, that sometimes a whole issue may be designed around a topic that you are not interested in, so the whole issue is of no use to you 
A friend of mine used to subscribe to Bon Appetit and flipping through the magazine I found so many interesting recipes. 
I love to cook. I am not a professional by all means but I do enjoy the concept of preparing food. Other than tv, "Bon Appetit" is one of my main sources I refer to that inspires me to create my next meal. I have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now. I have to admit I don't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that I read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas. Some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue (I love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years) and Thanksgiving. What I am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end. From my point of view, a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make. I am blessed to live in a big city where I can find most of the ingredients but if I lived in a smaller city or town, it probably would be difficult to find. These recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed. All in all, I still enjoy reading "Bon Appetit" and being inspired by the magazine 
I can give this great music magazine no greater praise than to say that pretty much all of my favorite new bands in the last couple of years have been discovered through Under the Radar. On top of that, they also write great articles on some of my pre-existing favorite bands. Under the Radar generally has much better writing than some of the other indie music mags out there (Devil In the Woods, Rockpile, Big Takeover, etc.) and fits my musical tastes perfectly 
as a new subscriber i have only gotten one issue of under the radar. however the one issue i have recieved is fantastic. it has pages of great reviews and a very in-depth story on the cover artist. there is virtually no filler and there's page after page of stories on up and coming talent and lesser known musicians. this also isn't a magazine that you breeze through in 20 minutes and never look at again. my only complaint about this magazine is it's quarterly publication, i wish i could have one every month. under the radar is worth the money to subscrib 
It may be called "Under the Radar," but this indie-rock music mag is way above average. Stuffed with insightful articles, relevant news and outstanding bands, Under the Radar is a must-have for fans of good indie-pop, rock and blow-your-mind alternative. Don't look for greasy gossip or trends -- just music, music and music. It starts off with some smaller interviews and Q, which still manage to be insightful as they interview people like Stephen Malkmus and Interpol. Then it's on to the major articles -- in-depth studies of the bands and the individual people. But Under the Radar also delves into the background of the music, how the bands feel about their fans, the inspiration, the side projects, and much more. Under the Radar also keeps an eye on the future: They cover future music releases by bands like Hot Hot Heat, the Doves, and Sparklehorse, as well as giving tabs on what other bands (Broken Social Scene) are doing in the limbo between albums. And of course -- new bands! They offer some good looks into promising newcomers who are just starting out in the musical world. The music-journalism world has undergone a bit of a revolution -- commercialized, aging mags like Spin and Rolling Stone are being supplanted by smaller but more relevant magazines like Filter and the online Kludge. Under the Radar is one such magazine -- except for frequency, there is nothing to complain about in this wonderfully in-depth, well-written exploration of good music -- Modest Mouse, Dntel, Beta Band, Clinic, the Decemberists, Sun Kil Moon and much more. Let's get this out of the way quickly -- compared to most music magazines, Under the Radar comes out infrequently. As a result, if you pick it up in a bookstore, you may find that the "future releases" have already come out. However, the insightful content and all the music it can introduce you to are worth the wait. The interviews are the best part of it all. The writing is calm, without the hyperactive, jokey wannabe-coolness that most magazines are infected with. The interviewers and columnists for Under the Radar are respectful and laid-back -- no "about your girlfriend" questions, thankfully. In these interviews, the musicians seem relaxed and at ease, like they know they're in good hands. But they can also be solemn -- in the sixth issue, Marcus Kagler gives a poignant tribute to the late Elliott Smith, remembering what Smith was like. While still a relative newcomer, Under the Radar shows that it it should be up there with Mojo and Filter as a must-have for music geeks. Toss out your copies of Rolling Stone and pick up Under the Radar instead 
I agree that Veranda has too many advertisements, but that's the trade-off for this very affordable, high quality publication. I'm not sure I'm the intended target for this magazine because I can't afford most of the things in the ads, but I've gotten lots of ideas about color, layout and accessorizing that I can use, and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style. 
A woman that is passionate about beautiful things writes this review. I am an avid do-it-yourselfer and love to do things around the house. This magazine has been one of my favorites for years. I look forward to each new issue and the decorating ideas that it will provide. This magazine concentrates on upscale decorating, architecture and landscapes. Many of the articles feature European country looks. The photographs in this magazine are absolutely beautiful. The July / August 2006 edition contained the following: 1. Venetian Villa (Adrienne Vittadini in Sarasota Florida) 2. Nantucket Renewal (Enlarging a Classic Cottage) 3. Blooming Intensity (Saturated with Color) 4. Coastal Hues (Seaside Radiance Captured) 5. British Accent (This side of the Pond) 6. The Art of Dining 7. The View from Veranda (Summer Place) 8. Tableaux (Staged Elegance) 9. Personal Luxury (Cool Coral) 10. On Exhibit (Jungles in Paris) 11. Trade Secrets (Summertime: Fabrics, Rugs, Lighting) 12. Passions (Birds of Paradise: Home Aviary Design) 13. Showcase (Summer Seating: For Pool and Porch) 14. Verdant Paths (Annevoie: Belgium's Water Garden) 15. The Last Word (Vanity Flair: Adrienne Vittadini Sketchbook) There are many photographs of this magazine of both house interiors and exteriors that I find to be very inspirational from a decorating perspective. If you are looking for either painting or decorating ideas this magazine has much to offer. I have replicated some of the interiors in my own home. The exterior photographs of this magazine are always very appealing. I have been slowing changing the landscaping on my property to reflect a more Italian way of life. I think you will be inspired to create an alfresco dining space after you have seen some of the beautiful landscape photographs. The merchants that advertise in this magazine are fabulous. I have purchased many items from them and have always been happy with my purchases. I highly recommend this magazine to anyone that loves interior design, or just likes nice things. This magazine is top notch all the way. 
This magazine is so packed full of goodies that you may need something with wheels to carry it out. The paper alone is worth the price. There are a lot of good books on decorating. And more on picture of foreign places. This one however is of items that you will want and maybe even afford one or two, if you have not spent all your discretionary money on books and book cases. Every library should have a fire place and this magazine often shows some of the best surrounds. The furniture and art work is well within the norm but just beyond the ordinary. Even if you do not take advantage of the ads and articles to spruce up your abode, you can sit back and dream of being there. 
1) A "Why Not?" page toward the beginning of the magazine, with short blurbs on useful things to do. An example: Where to recycle corks from wine bottles. Another example: How to turn dead leaves on your lawn into mulch to fertilize your yard, rather than bagging up the leaves. 2) Lots of recipes and cooking tips (The current issue includes vegetarian dishes.) 3) Reader's tips on a "question of the month." Example: "How do you save money during the holidays?" One winner each month receives a prize. 4) A Solutions section, including "New Uses for Old Things." For each item, the original purpose is described along with an "Aha! Use." 5) A section on organizing. 6) "Road Tests." Four items are featured, with comparisons in each category. This month: winter gloves, food processors, cleansing cloths, and vanilla ice cream. Even if you are not shopping for these items now, the info is useful for later. Two years ago, I bought an extremely reasonably priced set of durable everyday glassware based on their recommendation, and I have been very pleased with the glasses. 7) "Life Lessons." Personal, reflective essays that are very thoughtful and ispiring. 8) Home (including decorating), beauty, style, and body (health) sections. I discovered a great website for world art (supported by National Geographic, not of the commercialized Pier One variety), thanks to them. 9) A "Life" section that includes tips on how to navigate conflicts and difficult situations. 10) This month: A wonderful article on creative ways to preserve your family history. I loved the ideas and loved reading about the contributors' families--absolutely fascinating. 11) Lots of tips on saving money, time, and energy. Many of their tips do not involve trips to the store (or online shopping, for that matter). 12) A cardstock pull-out reference page in the back, with perforated edges to make small cards that you can carry in your wallet. There is always an inspirational quote (this month's is by P.G. Wodehouse) that you can use as a bookmark. Speaking of quotes, there is always a great quote near the front of the magazine and another on the spine of the cover. Yes, there is a target demographic for this magazine. I am not sure whether I would actually fit Time, Inc.'s target demographic--I am a single graduate student, living in a small apartment--but I always learn a lot from each issue. Not every article appeals to me equally, but that is always the case with a magazine. I save the best articles and file them by topic in a binder, along with articles from Vegetarian Times (the only other magazine to which I subscribe) and Runner's World (a friend gives me her old magazines). The hefty amount of advertising is annoying, but this is the result of the consolidation of the magazine publication world. Time, Inc., also publishes In Style, Essence, and many other magazines. If you want a non-glitzy, anti-establishment magazine, read something like B*tch (yes, it is an actual magazine, although I censored the title for this review, and I love it--will probably subscribe one of these days). But if you are just looking for ways to make your life a little easier, order Real Simple. It's not going to teach you how to give up all of your earthly possessions and move to a Peruvian village where you can start your own subsistence farm and weave your fabric from a loom, but it will give you tips on how to make your day-to-day life simpler right where you are. Oh, and Real Simple is branching out: a great website, three published books (on organizing, tips, and cooking), and a show on PBS. No, not TLC or HGTV, but free television for everyone. Kind of populist for an entity of Time, Inc., isn't it 
Nice replacement for my Oprah Magazine. Like the concise and to the point articles. Good suggestions sprinkled in magazine. Very heavy with the advertisements...but then the ads rip out quickly, leaving a more simple Real Simple read. 
REAL SIMPLE is exactly what the name implies. There is no clutter on the pages, which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter. It's excellent for those individuals that can't multi-task well and never throw anything away 
I am not a big magazine reader -- never have been, never really had time to! However, a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read...after falling in love every time read it I finally I had to get a subscription of my own! This magazine covers everything! It's got tips for life, cooking, decorating, organzing, and getting the best deal for your money. A lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas, for instance, are stuff that I use and apply to my normal life. For example: the July 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler. The result of that recipe was a WONDERFUL dessert for my family of four that took me... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great! They don't endorse products NEARLY to the same degree that most magazines do, and when they do it's in an article where they had comparisons done...always a recommendation, and usually more than one. The important thing here is they don't say "buy this product" they say "buy products that have such and such feature, make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair, and oh here's an example of what we're talking about." They make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme. So, in conclusion, if you're like me and can use a few extra ideas about EVERYTHING in your life...this is a great magazine. The information is helpful, applicable to normal everyday life...and it's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers 
I just wanted to comment on some of the other reviews that are posted here. Many try to sterotype the type of readers who like Real Simple, well I love this magazine- and didn't manage to fit into any of there categories. My aunt sent me this magazine and then I began to read it monthly, I enjoy the tips and sections like "No time to clean?, quick solutions for every room"- yes they do have product suggestions, but much of the information that is provided can be done with things you already have. Others have called this magazine- " a slave to fashion", as a woman in her 20's I would say this magazine is the one that contains minimal clothing information. Overall I enjoy this magazine, as others have mentioned the recipes are great and I always find plenty of good tips. The photography and layout are amazing, I always use the old editions for reference or crafts 
My mother bought me a gift subscription when I moved in to my first apartment. I love this magazine. I pass the recipies on to family and friends, who have enjoyed them as well. The simple solutions to everyday needs are extremely helpful and well worth the $30 or so for a subscription. I am buying it for a housewarming present for a friend this week. 
I've been a reader since day one and the magazine is filled with time saving tips on cooking, space saving ideas and ideas and even wardrobe tips. For $5 Real Simple offers great tips and Real Simple is geared towards real people with real lives and not the New York loft crowd or mid-west country living crowd...not to be stereotypical but that's how most magazines are geared one coast of the other. Real simple is a great magazine and it continues to be number one in my book. 
"true detective" is a classic old magazine. my 83 year old father in law loved seeing it again. an early father's day gift. he read it from front to back in a day. we were surprized to see it was shipped from England! my mother in law and i split the cost. it was well worth the money to order it, because he "truely" enjoyed it! thanks! lyn 
I bought this for my nephew last year for Christmas - and he reads it cover to cover every month!! I have renewed for him and he is delighted to have this magazine. 
SI for Kids is even better than the one for adults 
Both of our grandsons love getting SI for Kids. It is a great way to introduce them to reading for fun 
We are very happy with how quickly our fiest issue arrived. We ordered on 1-25-06 and our first issue arrived 2-24-06 (almost a month earlier than anticipated!) 
We bought a subscription to Sports Illustrated for Kids last year for our Grandson's birthday. He is interested in all sports, but especially football. He enjoys the magazine so much we renewed the subscription for his birthday this year. Happy 11th Birthday, Matt. With love, Grandma and Grandp 
What kind of magazine can you get for that age in between? To old for the "Highlights" or other kids mags and still to young (girls anyway) for Seventeen, Teen People or Young Miss...RANGER RICK!! My daughter is 10 and just LOVES Ranger Rick. She has a great love of nature and wildlife and this just fuels her curiosity. Filled with outstanding pictures, fun facts and great information, she enjoys it all! Highly Recommend for a gift when your not sure what to get 
This is an excellent magazine. My young son has been recieving this magazine and has enjoyed it every month. It provides factual information in an interesting format. It has lovely pictures. There are stories, crafts and games that all teach about one main theme with the over lapping idea being all about nature. It is educational and yet it is not boring or overwhelming wtih facts and figures. It is great for the age 7-10 crowd. 
I grew up on Ranger Rick, and was overjoyed to find the mag again. Its just as good as ever and perfect for nature loving kids. Its highly educational and fun. I still remember 20 years ago running to the mailbox waiting for Ranger Rick. Great magazine, truely. Your kids are likely to learn more from RR than at school. 
We ordered Ranger Rick for our kidergartener grandson. He loves receiving the magazine in the mail. The gorgeous photos pique his interest and encourage him to "read" through every page. We spend time reading the articles aloud to him, thus enjoying some "quality" time with each other. He remembers much of the information, which enhances his learning skills. All-in all, the Ranger Rick subscription is a plus. We figure, as time goes by, our grandson will enjoy the magazine for years to come, especially when he's able to read the articles himself 
My 4 year old son will not go to sleep with out reading this mag. front to back. We have sent subscipts to all our younger family members. To this day my nephew @ 11 yrs uses it for book reports in school. Can't say enough wonderful things. Thank you to the editors of Ranger Rick. P.S. we also ordered the 2 younger series for babys and toddlers love them just as much. I highly suggest for everyone, @ 40 yrs I am learning new things and love it. My son LOVES the Ranger Rick Adventures (comic). You will be thrilled every month 
I purchased National Geographic Kids, Your Big Bad Yard, Animal Baby and Ranger Rick for a family of four children. They fight over each issue and now want renewals. How much better is this than a $20 toy for them, their parents and me? How does it feel to have a child remind me in July that he loves his Christmas gift? Immeasurable. There is no down side 
I thought since Zoobooks is such a hit in my house that my son would enjoy Ranger Rick. That is not the case, but he does enjoy having this magazine between the mailings of Zoobooks. Ranger Rick arrives always on the first of the month or thereabouts. It is more punctual than Zoobooks. I have never had to call to ask where the current issue was. The focus is on animals and published by National Wildlife Federation. There are poems, fun pages, photos, letters and more. I think that the focus is on activities and not so much pictures of animals. My son can peruse through the Ranger Rick in one sitting and then says he has read it through. He does not refer back to the issues as often as he does with the Zoobooks. There are more pages in each issue. The Sep 2005 has 39 pages. This issue has pelicans, bears and mini beasts. It does not spotlight one animal for each issue. We have saved each issue and will be renewing. Teachers can get a free gtuide online to the magazine 
I got a free subscription to this newspaper and I am thoroughly enjoying it. The Olympics coverage was wonderful along with the color pics. I like their editorial pages too and my favorite part is the Life section. I love the color pics and the celebrity news and the reality TV news synopsis. I used to only read this paper when travelling or on vacation. Now I am reading it daily and they may have a subscriber for life 
as a subscriber to the washington post and a reader of usa today i can say that usa is just alot more interesting. sure it may not have all the details, but it give enough information without making it boring. the color is great as are the graphs and feature articles. it may not be good for a buisnessman looking for information but the usa today is just fine for everyday news 
Ever since USA Today started publishing, it has been made fun of. And can't understand why. This a great paper that gives its readers the facts that they need to get though the day. One of the main reason that I enjoy USA Today it has little advertisements,unlike my local paper. It also give me news from everystate. USA Today is great paper for readers looking for just the facts and not alot of fluff 
Its a good magazine that doesn't have hysterical or over hyped pieces. While I do not always agree with the conclusions of the writers, the magazine does what Time, Newsweek etc do not do. Make one think. I also applaud them for being honest and having articles taking the currant administration to task for failings and for being honest in challenging conservatives to get their act together. While William Kristol and Fred Barnes are often noted as being the most notable at the magazine I actually like other writers like John Simon, William Doino Jr, Vance Serchuk (who wrote a great review of a book I own The White Man's Burden Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good by William Easterly),John Podhoretz, Gerard Alexander. Now I know as far as subscriptions go the price may seem high. But I suggest you subscribe and then donate the copies to your local library. They will appreciate the gift. I also have to note that I really love the artists who do the covers and that as a subscriber I can also read issues online 
I read part of the 'Weekly Standard' each week online. I do not know if that means I qualify to review the paper as a whole. I find its articles informative and straightforward. There is a certain economy about the publication. It seems to me sometimes as if it is a kind of 'Wall Street Journal' in color. I suppose one reason I do not take objection to it in any serious way is that I most often agree with its politics. When I read its articles I feel I am getting the most for my money in the short time it takes me. 
This is the only political magazine I will read. It is a great read if one is a conservative, but someone with liberal ideas may not care for it 
Although I'm a Casey Democrat, meaning a social conservative and a fiscal progressive, I enjoy the Weekly Standard as probably the best neo-conservative magazine on the market. I find it timely, informative, provocative and in-depth in terms of its coverage of issues. I particularly like their "Week in Review" feature, whereby they review events of the week and provide some pointed commentary. But where I particularly came to appreciate the Weekly Standard is in the debate over moral issues -- they offered innovative and clear arguments in favor of traditional family values, using solid research and up-to-date statistics from numerous different disciplines, while avoiding the usual worn rhetoric of the family values crowd (among which I include myself as a Casey Democrat.) 
PC World keeps me up to date with what's new in the industry and gives me lots of helpful hints to improve my computing experience. 
Great magazine for those who are not tech professionals, or who have just started in a tech field, who want to stay on top of the latest products, ideas, and technology news. Good troubleshooting tips for your computer, software programs, and other electronics as well. Loved it so much I decided to order a year's subscription. ***DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON. I ORDERED THE MAG SEPT 7TH AND AS OF DEC 3RD I AM STILL WAITING FOR IT. Amazon is a reliable party, however the subscriptions are outsourced to others. If you have a problem with a subscription order, it is not handled through Amazon.*** UPDATE: Finally received 1st issue in late December and the subscription was backdated to continue through Nov 2006. However, if you want quicker delivery, order a subscription elsewhere 
I've had a subscription to PC World over the past few years (as a gift) and I love it. The articles are very insightful and relevant. I can always find at least one article in each magazine that helps me with a computer issue I'm having at the time or provides me with reviews on electronic devices that I'm looking to buy 
NYRB and the Atlantic Monthly are among my favorite subscriptions; In terms of sheer intellectual depth and range, it is very tough to beat the NYRB. While I do not read the NYRB cover to cover, I end up spending at least 5 hrs on each issue. The main strength of this magazine is the fact that a typical article is written by an expert with deep knowledge of the subject (some times opinionated; but always intelligent and engaging). While the article typically draws on more than a single book, I like the fact that the article is typically written as a commentary around a theme and is more than a summary of the books under review. 
THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS is published 20 times a year, biweekly except in January, July, August and September. It is a respected publication which is devoted mostly to reviews of current books and an occasional movie. It also contains articles of social or political interest. The Letters section is usually brief with little waste. Contributors to a recent edition included Mark Danner, Sister Helen Prejean and Daniel Mendelsohn. Reviews covered such diverse items as a collection of short stories by Graham Greene and two books about the actress Anna May Wong in addition to ALEXANDER, a film directed by Oliver Stone. THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS consistently offers provocative writing in a highly readable style. It definitely deserves its reputation for excellence 
NYRB features long, in-depth articles about recent books and events. The "reviews" frequently take the book under discussion as a starting point for a wide-ranging essay which then becomes a work in its own right. Indeed, I've seen articles in NYRB referred to in academic papers. Don't fear that NYRB will bore you, however. I've often found a NYRB article to be a great introduction to an area of thought or literature previously unknown to me. The only negative is a rather tedious Michael-Mooreish political stance. I have no objection to seeing Bush bashed, but wish that NYRB could do so in a more creative and less repetitive manner. Maybe once in a while we could hear from someone who actually likes the man? Nevertheless I find NYRB an indispensable periodical. I find it a great complement to The Economist, which features a more pro-business and pro-free trade economic stance and wider, but less deep, coverage of the world 
A playground for the mind. Covers a wide range of subjects. Each review is a full essay on the subject of the book. Many reviews compare and contrast several recently published books on the same subject. Learned and sophisticated yet fully accessible. An on-going liberal arts education and the easiest way I know to keep the eclectic learning that a liberal arts education aspires to 
This magazine couldnt possibly get any more helpful than it allready is. My only complaint is the 4 issues a month. Other than that it is allmost flawless. Anyone interested in film making at all should get a subscription 
Moviemaker is great for the beginner and the pro-indie alike. This magazine features interviews with Hollywood moguls as well as independant greats. There are helpful articles ranging from what DVDs that can serve as film school to festival information. Everything is informative, even if it's just a short bit about a new type of equipment. Moviemaker may not come out monthly, but each issue is worth the wait! 
My daughter LOVED this magazine and couldn't wait to take it to Grandma's house to make the recipe's and do the projects. She's now into Spider age level but when I have my 2nd child I'll be ordering this magazine again for them 
These are SOOOOOOO great. The pictures really help the kids to learn the words, and the entire product is first class. A really fun monthly mailer that parents and kids alike will enjoy 
We received this magazine as a gift subscription last December. Beautiful illustrations and interesting short stories with large letters so they are easy for children to read. My daughter (age 4) can read some of them herself, my son (age 3) looks at the words and the pictures and listens to my daughter read and I have even enjoyed reading this magazine from time to time. This is a great children's magazine! I recommend this magazine for children who have just learned to read and for children and parents to read together 
Product was shipped promptly and asrrived as described by seller. Would recommend to anyone 
keeps you up to date on the worlds sports news of the week. is better than t 
Sports Illustrated is a great magazine, the premier magazine for sports. The writing in it is spectacular as well as the clear and helpful visuals that go along with every article. To make this short, I highly recommend this a subscription for any sports fan -- it's a great gift for a husband, boyfriend, or just any sports fan 
I ordered a subscription to SI for my boyfriend's birthday, he was so excited and surprised! His first issue came even before they said it would. I highly recommend the magazine for any true sports fan 
'Sports Illustrated' is the one sports magazine which covers in a good way all the major sports. It has been a feature of American life for over half a century. One of the features I recently took great interest in reading was its list of the one- hundred greatest sports books. 
For me, the September issue of Vogue, with its 700 page issue, is more than eye candy. It's art. It's that simple. I no longer look at most of the fashion in the magazine, nor the models, as realistic, something that can ever transfer into my own life, nor would I want it to. It reminds me of trips to art museums where I can admire one painting half the afternoon, but it doesn't mean I want it hanging on my wall at home. Vogue's photography is exquiste, pure art. The glossy pages, the vibrant, sometimes muted colors, seem to jump off the page. The images make my mind wander and explore. When I finally got over the ridiculous prices and the more ridiculously thin models with legs longer than I am tall, I was able to fully appreciate the artistry of the ads and fashion spreads. I find the ads are as engaging as the fashion spreads, which is a good thing, for the magazine is at least half ads. Some of the articles are good as well. I skip over the few society articles, and I've been surprised at the number of well-written pieces that apply to the average well-educated, sophisticated person. No, Cosmo readers most likely won't find much in Vogue, but I'd say women over 30, who are relatively world-wise, will find articles geared toward them. Overall, Vogue is a high end publication that has high end photographers and produces rather sweet eye candy with some decent non-fashion articles 
If you love fashion, you need to get Vogue. Vogue will familiarize you with designers, classic style and the fancy-schmancy side of fashion that most other magazines will not get as deep into. However, most of what is in Vogue is way out of the average person's reach. I, for one, could very likely not afford one thing that has ever been in a single copy of Vogue. However, for whatever reason, the Vogue empire continues to publish this fashion tome and sell the subs for a VERY low price (usually $12 for 12 issues). Now THAT I can afford. It is an unbeatable deal. Will you glean anything from it? Yes. You will see how the other side lives and you will see some really wonderful photography and fashion at its best. Is it practical? Not really but it is fun and well worth the very low price. 
When I was a little girl I always tried to steal my friend mother's "Cosmopolitan". I didn't really understand what Cosmo really was, but at the time I truly believed that was what every women read. My mother found me reading it with my friend and almost lost her mind, when I came back from school a vogue was waiting for me in the mailbox. I thought it was my mother's but she told me if I was going to idolize a women's magazine and wouldn't stick to my Highlights or American Girl, I would idolize something sensible. I was just a little girl glancing at the glossy pages of high end clothing from Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent, loving each beautiful model, amazed by the greatest photos ever taken for a fashion magazine (Annie Leibovitz has become the most used and artistically drawn photographer used by Vogue), and the best articles that can be used for brainless reading material or important advice. Six years later I'm still reading Vogue (and can use the advice more productively than I could have when I was twelve.) I sort of matured faster than other girls, while they were talking about who were they taking for the dance, I was discussing why the price of silk and taffeta were lowering due to China's economy expansion and about Tom Ford designing for the retired Yves Saint Laurent....well not exactly but you get my point. One down side is I've gotten addicted to the evils the Vogue brings. From it's amazing ads, I've come to love the more expensive things in life, like designer handbags and beautiful coats. I've even gone on more diets I can count (but this comes from Anna Wintour, who even told Oprah "I would love to be on our cover--but you have to loose 30", the woman is persistant about thinness in her magazine.) However, I truly feel that I have become the woman I am today instead of boxer wearing tomboy with no manners at all, because of Vogue. The reason I gave only four stars is because I'm truly starting to apperciate W Magazine. It has the need to know gossip, the longer pages, and more of a down to earth approach for those who really don't associate, or can stand, the socialite world. 
Interesting May 05 issue. When I saw the cover I sighed and with a somewhat sinking heart picked it up wondering who "now" had declared war on America. Oh! why it's only the Christians now. This was a great issue. I had not read one in quite awhile and forgotten how funny and sad they could be. The Harper's Index page is full of eyebrow lifting information. Readings was great. The articles on the market economy and the religious right was a jaw dropper. I had to get up and look under the table to find where mine had fallen and rolled. Most everyone knows this information in some depth and degree but . . . these articles were different. Like some other books and articles I have read they are couched with the attitude of, "Wake up, please. Throw some water on your face, look around and Wake Up, hurry before it's too late". Once you get through the large amount of heartbreaking information contained (Please tell me that America did not `sell' cornmeal that we knew was going to starving people etc., etc., etc.) you are deposited at Karbola for an account of the Sunni versus Shia and then on to Katmandu and the monarchy and Maoists. The final article is on Tango dancers and somewhat of a relief. After reading this you might want to go home and just pull the covers over your head. Don't. Waddle around to another section and fiind a magazine called "What is Enlightenment?" The April/May issue has a equally jaw dropping set of articles on the market economy. It's the perfect follow up to the Harper's. Harper's is a wake up call if you've slept late. WIE is the what can we roll up our sleeves and do about it. The people they interviewed are not Pollyannas. Several are quoted as saying that they really think there may be nothing left to do but totally dismantle the old system but they are willing to put that aside and focus on fixing instead of destroying and trying their hardest to make the new ideas work. They have some incredible contributers to the articles and to the new system they are trying to impliment. Short articles from Dadi Janki and Joseph P. Milton are included. The article about Tex Gunning - President of Unilever Bestfoods Asia and his new direction for his company is wonderful. These are people who are trying to shift the whole attitude of companies. It's not the current spate of altrustic activity that is geared more toward upping sales with profit as the end result but a real shift to business conducted with the end result as a healthy, sustainable world. The end result would benefit humanity first, the business second and the shareholders third. Novel concept eh? They make you believe that it just may work. They are however very up front about the timeline and how many people have to be shifted - quickly - in order for it to work. Read them both - it's worth the time and I think that they both have something very important to say. 
In the several years since my retirement, I have come to wait by my trusty old rusted metal mailbox around the third or fourth of every month, waiting for my monthly issue of two magazines, the Atlantic Monthly and Harpers. Each in iuts own way is likely the best amalgams of intellectual articles on a variety of subjects one can find in contemporary America, and each features a stable of highly regarded writers and authors. For good reason; from subjects as arcane as the supposed imminent fall of the Soviet union based on demographic and economic analysis in the mid-1980s to the recent synopsis of former spy Robert Baer regarding the evils of dealing with the highly corrupted Saudi regime, the magazine consistently offers an erudite, informative, and provocative look at aspects of contemporary reality one cannot find elsewhere. Needless to say, I really enjoy reading Harpers, especially under the guidance of editor Lewis lapham, and its articles often lead me on Amazon searches for tomes by the talented authors, which in the case of said author Robert Baer, or perpetually sagacious satirist P.J. O'Rourke, or a whole raft of noteable others. All of them lead to some worthwhile reading experiences indeed. It avoids the trendy, so we are spared the suffering through the latest and greatest mass experiences in favor of intellectual roads less traveled, being grassy and rather wont of wear, makes for better and more satisfying traveling, whether trudging through the snow with my Wintertime Dunham Tyroleans or padding down grassy fields in my summertime Birkenstocks. Just keep on trucking! Enjoy! 
I always enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mom -- while she shopped, I hung out in the magazine section reading Mad, Cracked, and FANGORIA. Now, 25 years later -- I finally got my own subscription -- and unlike retro video games, nostalgic 80's cd's, and Members Only jackets, this is just as good as I remember. It gives the inside scoop on the up coming major studio horror releases, the low down on independent, if not underground, extreme horror DVD's, and, as always has awesome pictures of rocking special gore effects. Any fan of the horror genre would love this magazine. It is a great read and a lot of fun. 
You've got to take your hat off to Fangoria. Whether their style of gory, visceral coverage of the horror genre appeals to you or not you can't deny their success. The fact that they've been doing it for 20 years is really a marvel in the world of magazines, let alone genre magazines. Fangoria is still tops in terms of their production values and photography although newer mags like Rue Morgue and some of the imports are certainly as good. Fangoria each month checks in with a very large array of reviews of both current releases and older releases that you may have missed. Since many of these films go direct to video, chances are you probably did miss them. Besides movies they also cover Horror fiction and non-fiction, TV and even a smattering of music where appropriate. If there's a minor complaint about Fangoria it's that sometimes they come off a bit fannish and perhaps not as critical of movies as they should be. Honestly I've watched movies they've given favorable reviews to and wondered just what in the heck they were smoking when they watched. The other complaint would be that they devote almost no space to classic horror, but that's just a pet peeve 
Fangoria always has and always will be the greatest horror magazine around. Terrific on the set previews of the latest films, retrospectives on classic films ,dvd reviews and always dependable for bloody photo's from your favorite movies 
I totally love this magazine I would marry it in a heartbeat even though Ive never had a subscription 
I have always enjoyed Marie Claire. I don't know why I took so long to actually get a subscription. It's a well rounded magazine, and well suited for women who are younger and older 
Every issue of Marie Claire covers everyhting: fashion, makeup, beauty, men, events, how people live around the world, and ways you can help other women suffering from abuse, natural disasters, etc. I hate magazines that only shows clothes and models, and this is not one of them. Marie Claire covers everything and every month, I learn something new after reading it 
As women's magazines go, Marie Claire is definately the best of the bunch. It focuses on more than just fashion. It has serious articles and some cute fun ones, besides. They have had articles on: A woman who obeys an 8-ball for a month A man who wears make-up for a week Thai prostitution Self-image Stress What women around the world keep in their underwear drawers And lots and lots on fashion They have a nice mix of articles. You can always find an article or two that you really like in each issue 
Still think that Marie Claire is a cut above most women's magazines 
If I could only subscribe to one magazine, I'd pick Marie Claire in a heart beat. It offers everything other women magazine have, including love life, diet, beauty, fashion and celebrity. In addition, Marie Claire focuses on issues larger than the domestic US. Being an educated young woman, I am interested in real life issues that other magazines tend to ignore. Not only does Marie Claire have the guts to discuss issues that are hard to read at times (domestic abuse, prostitution in Asia, weight discrimination, etc.), but they actually tell you HOW you can help. By listing numerous websites and phone numbers along with their article, it allows me to research the topic further and makes taking action just that much easier. The cover of Marie Claire may not look any different than any other women magazine, but open it up and I guarantee you will see a difference 
A great magazine that puts the rest of "womens magazines" to shame. This one talks about women's issues worldwide, what you can do to help, as well as the more mainstream fashion stuff. Also not heavy on the advertising like so many. A great magazine 
I am a professional cook who has an expansive collection of cookbooks and food magazine subscriptions, and Gastronomica, without a doubt, is in a class by itself. It's a magazine that relishes all aspects of food culture, from indepth explorations of particular cuisines to quirky analyses of fun foods. Topics as diverse as coca-cola, Vietnamese pho, the parrot eaters, egg creams, irradiated foods, tea drinking, and the all-American butter cake are just a few of the always interesting, usually provocative, and oftentimes entertaining articles you'll read. This offbeat, classy magazine is for the thinking food lover. What a treat 
Gastronomica is a thoughtful, inspirational magazine, filled with insightful commentary on all aspects of food. The well-researched articles reflect the individual passion of its contributors; it is for the "thinking cook" who values substance over fluff. 
Well, they've not got a new Editor-In-Chief, the former executive editor, and well seeing as how I dont like him, I think it's brought the whole magazine down. There still is the now playing column in the Eyewitness section, and some of the staff, have gotten new pictures. I believe it was the June issue when this started, and they also changed the design of the magazine too, which of course bothers me less than the EIC. Of course, if u want to go with the old editor, then start reading the Official Xbox Magazine, because he's the new Chief there and I think he's increased the quality of that magazine ten-fold. The disc is still fine as usual, but for a good and humorous PC games magazine, pick up Computer Gaming World 
I unfortunately didn't renew my subscription to the Week years ago due to constant travel and never being around to read it. I have missed it deeplyt in that time. Having just gotten the first issue of my new subscription it lives up to all of my memories. A mixture of news items on all kinds of issues, from all sorts of publications and many points of view is refreshing and informative. I find out about important and interesting things about which most never hear. I cannot say enough good things about the Week 
Remember when the dawn of 24/7 cable news networks seemed to be a godsend? Now we know that that led to 24/7 garbage (Breaking news now means a peek at the food menu served to the self-confessed and deluded killer of Jonbenet Ramsay, the elevation of trivia to news status to fill time on a slow news day, the absence of any sort of perspective or background, the application of insane levels of urgency to minor health scares, endless celebrity gossip, etc.). I had enough of this nonsense. All I wanted was a brief summary of what was important with some context thrown in. All the truly significant news can be relayed in a brief period of time; the rest is junk meant to fill in the time between commercials. More time spent on news does not mean being better informed because 24/7 news is simply obsession with the same few stories, repeated ad nauseum. I tried the Christian Science Monitor. They have excellent standards but it is expensive to get every day. I then tried this publication. It met my needs. You get a complete summary of everything that was important in the previous week's news with a minimum amount of fluff. Celebrities are lucky to get a paragraph, if anything, in the entire issue. You come away from this magazine (easily read in an hour) with a great overview of all that mattered in the previous week. International and world stories get much more coverage than what you see on CNN, FOX, or your local paper. There doesn't seem to be any bias that I could detect. Get this if you want to decrease your time spent on news but still be well informed. Move over, you stodgy Time and Newsweek magazines 
The Week always seems to reflect at least three sides to every major story 
This one's my "must read" of the week. In my job, we have access to a plethora of news sources. Still, I don't have time to see what was important in the world by reading each and every one. The Week reduces information to the key arguments, citing recognized media with differing viewpoints. Sixty percent is dedicated to current news and smoking issues, with the remaining forty percent divided among blubs from the entertainment, real estate and epicurean and literary world. They also pick a salient current essay for each issue that runs about two pages. With The Week, I've read key points in world news in sixty minutes 
I have recieved "The Week" for over six months now. When I subscribed it in the begining I really hadn't a clue how much I would actually get from it as far as knowledge goes.I thought it Looked interesting enough and hay it was cheap, so I decided to give it a try. After recieving my first magizine I was hooked. This magizine seemed to cover a variety of things. It covered Politics, Current Events, Heart Touching Stories, Funny but True Stories, Cartoons, Information about different Hollywood Stars, and so much more. I never exspected it to be as info. packed as it was, trust me I have never felt dissatified with any of the magizines from "The Week" that I have recieved. I actually get all excitied when I get them in the mail and I tell my husband, " Yeaaah, My Politics are Here!" I also now got some of my other family hooked on The Week also, We Love It! This magizine has so much information and covers more current events than any other magizine I have seen. It is truely My One Only. I've saved a ton of money and space since I discovered The Week. It's very affordible and I used to buy at least Three other magizines twice a month, (Spending about $20.00 a month) to get the same information I get from The Week for less than a dollar an issue. 
We are charter subscribers to THE WEEK and have been so impressed that we give subscriptions as gifts 
I've been wanting to write a review about this magazine for some time, however, I haven't taken the time to do so until now. After reading the most recent review written by; Bryan Carey, there really isn't much more I can say. I couldn't have written a better review myself, other then the fact I've given the publication 5 stars! As far as I'm concerned this magazine is far better than Time, Newsweek, US News World Rpt., or any other news magazine on the market. I look forward to receiving the new issue every week 
The Week is an interesting publication among magazines! It likes to boast on the cover that it contains "All you need to know about everything that Matters". This magazine doesn't have a huge staff of writers like most magazines. Instead, The Week is a compilation of the best articles, columns, critical reviews, etc., from many different publications. I have read articles in The Week from such noteworthy publications as Financial Times, Business Week, The Chicago Tribune, Fortune, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and many more. The goal of the editors of The Week is to sift through hundreds of thousands of articles each week and look for the cream of the crop in journalistic inspiration. These best articles are then compiled together into one short magazine. What I like most about The Week is that it contains short, concise articles that get right to the point. It's rare to find any reading material in this magazine more than 1 page in length. In fact, most of the reading material is nothing more than short, 2 or 3 paragraph snips from other publications. While the articles don't go in- depth, they are short and simple and that makes them less intimidating to start reading. You feel more at ease to read with this magazine because you can turn directly to an area of interest and pick an article with the knowledge that you will be finished reading it in less than one minute. With other magazines, the length of some articles is often so great that readers will just skim through quickly, due to limited spare time. Another thing I like is that this magazine is basically unbiased. Anything that is significant in the news, politics, arts, etc., has a chance to get printed. That includes articles that are conservative, liberal, and everything in between. The editors of The Week are not concerned about what angle a story takes. They just strive to print articles that are among the best of the week, regardless of what political bias is shown. The Week is a short magazine, averaging only about 40 pages in length. There are very few advertisements in this magazine, which is also nice. In a typical issue, only about 6 pages are covered with ads, which equals only about 15 percent of the total pages. Of course, since the magazine consists of articles from other sources, some might say that it's really just one large advertisement. But it's still nice to have good, quality reading without so many of the ads. Overall, The Week has made me a satisfied subscriber. It's a good way to stay abreast of the latest happenings, trends, and news on a worldwide basis. The articles are short, fun, simple, and direct with splashes of humor throughout. I recommend The Week to just about anyone. It's one of the few magazines that's short enough and entertaining enough that I can read a full issue completely, while still looking forward to the next week's edition to arrive in my mailbox. Give it a try the next time you see a copy. It's a fun and informative read! 
The Week is a great magazine for anyone who is interested in current events but doesn't always have time to consume a lot of media. The snippets of world news are interesting and useful, the more in-depth excerpts tend to be on unusual and interesting topics, and the fun fillers (comics et al.) make it a fun, quick read. We really enjoy it from cover to cover. Nothing boring to skip 
I was surfing the net and I happened upon this site. It is obviously a amatures site, but it is chock full of valuable information. The photos on the site were vivid and intriguing. Not to mention that this site actually has links available for use when I was ready to book my travel. I discovered things to do in my destination location prior to leaving the comfort of my home and well in advance of taking my trip. As a long time traveler I highly recommend this site to any and everyone who travels. So give them a chance they are at http://www.mytravelscenes.com 
A lot of reviewers share similar views, as seen in the recurrence of similar criticism of today's magazines. What these complaints also have in common is that they can tend to be fairly uninformed in regard to certain issues. First off, we all know that T+L is for "affluent travelers." Read the publisher's description, and it will tell you just that. So if you're not an affluent traveler, then don't waste your money on T+L and stick to Budget Travel. T+L occassionally has "affordable" stories, especially in their affordable issue in March. But don't expect the hotels to be to be under $200 a night. You know why? Because nowadays under $200 a night means you're a step above a youth hostal, especially in Europe where you pay an extra 20% on top of every dollar with today's exchange rate. The point is that T+L never positioned itself as an affordable travel mag, so to criticize its shortcomings in that respect is an invalid complaint. Anyone who claims the photography is blown out and out of focus hasn't picked up a copy of the magazine since 1999. Furthermore, if all you saw were straightforward photographs of hotel rooms, you'd go out of your mind with boredom. There's nothing wrong with adding a little art to your photography, after all photography is in fact art, and T+L does a pretty good job of that. And so what if there's a beautiful woman in the photo. No one's saying you have to look like her or promising that she'll be strewn across the bed in your hotel room. Use your imagination - this is travel photography in Travel + Leisure magazine - it ain't Newsweek. And with all of the other offensive problems with media today, only in America do people complain about too much skin. Lastly, readers need to understand that magazines don't put in more ads for giggles. A magazine is a business, and ad revenue is THE way a magazine earns money. So the more ads they have, the more profit they have, the more money they have to pay better photographers and writers and hire more staff and do more research, etc, etc, etc. No magazine is going to choose to throw away money in order to not offend its readers with fewer ad pages. In fact, high ad content is an indication of a high circulation, which is an indication of reader satisfaction. The more people a magazine reaches, the more companies want to advertise there. The fact of the matter is that there is no perfect travel magazine in existence. They are either too service heavy, or editorial fluff, or too scientific and adventure-y, or just a b-level publication. T+L has its shortcomings, it has its top whatever lists and there's a lot of high-end service in there. But it's stunning and has its share of well written and interesting articles 
This reader thoroughly enjoys the photos and articles about 'exotic' vacations in Europe, Asia, the Southern Hemisphere (New Zealand] and Central or South America ... one can dream ... and possibly one day live the dream. One learns of vacations in out-of-the-way unique locales. For instance, in the July 2004 issue, there is a feature article on "Puglia' dubbed "the next Tuscany". There one can rent space in a 15th century convent or room at the most modern resort. In either case, one can taste the finest Italian cuisine, fresh food, grown and raised in the region. Another adventure which appeals to this reader is "perfume tours in Provence". This reader is in love with Mayan ruins, so reading about how Richard Hansen, an U.C.L.A. archeologist, has worked for 25 years to excavate and preserve, El Mirador, one of the largest mayan cities, is of great value. This reader shares his dream to designate the region a national monument and turn it into a living outdoor museum. It would become a top tourist attraction, such as the Tikal National Park (Guatemala's most popular). Another fascinating article featured "Shanghai". Here one learns of where to shop for silk slippers and the beautiufl blue and white porcelain for which it is famous. A person can have designer clothes copied by tailors at huge savings ... The contrast of ancient and modern China is amazing. Going antique shopping would be most satisfying ... Featuring, Ming Tsai, a Chinese chef and owner of "The Blue Ginger" Restaurant in Massachsetts is quite the perfect ending to a wonderful magazine. He is often featured on PBS channels sharing his recipes and techniques for Chinese cooking. This reader enjoys every article and looks forward to each monthly issure. Highest recommendations.

For lovers of audiobooks, Audiofile Magazine performs a valuable service. While I read book reviews from many sources, Audiofile Magazine is the only reviewing service I've found that provides feedback on the quality of the listening experience. Highly recommended 
As someone who loves to read, and finds it increasingly difficult to find time to do so in a time crunched world, I rely on Audiofile magazine to point me in the direction of what will provide a great listening experience.It provides reviews which I find are very accurate and illuminating. Through the magazine I have been guided to many authors, narrators and subjects that I might previously have been unaware of, or overlooked.The review section covers several different categories of book in every issue, describing content, and highlighting excellence.Sometimes the authors of a book will be interviewed with the review of a narrators work side by side. This I find fascinating. The articles give an insider look at an ever changing industry, and "connect up the dots" of this fascinating, mysterious world by discussing anything and everything that is audiobook related. Audiofile is the only place I can count on to recieve accurate information about this growing and rapidly changing industry, that remains largely unsung elsewhere. It is a highlight when I recieve the latest copy, go through it and plan what I am going to listen to next.It has led me to many works I might never have considerd and helps me follow my favorite narrators, audio related events etc.Whether you are an everyday listener or an industry professional,AudioFile is a lifeline! Life would be a lot duller without this irreplaceable guide 
For lovers of audio books, this is a must have magazine. The reviews are thorough and interesting. I have seldom found I review that has not been helpful. f I enjoy the articles and even the ads. The magazine has a service whereby they send you, via email, upcoming reviews. I am a knitter, handspinner and weaver and audio books are my constant companion. It is important to me to have a source of reviews. There is nothing like renting or buying and audio book and not liking it. I highly recommend this magazine 
This magazine will aid you in your quest to become a PC guru, however it tends to be ad swayed in its reviews of products, software and hardware. You'll learn alot from this and other PC magazines... from basic firewall configuration, to knowing how to install missing files in sub-directories you never knew existed. Good for the PC enthusiast who want's to improve his 'skills', and for the techie who needs advanced PC info. The info is good, the reviews tend to be weighted by advertising, so take reviews with a grain of salt and look for reviews for that particular product, software etc, elsewhere 
Have enjoyed PC Magazine since the early 80's...an invaluable source of information and insight...a must read 
PC Magazine is the largest, most expensive magazine of its kind, but it is well worth the price. I used to have a subscription and found its detailed product reviews helpful in making decisions about purchasing PCs, hardware peripherals and software. These reviews are among the most extensive I've come across in computer magazines. It is not a magazine for those who are technically illiterate, since its intended audience seems to be those who might call themselves "techno geeks". And it is not a magazine - like Wired, for example - that seems interested in covering the future of PC computing. Nevertheless, it is a fine magazine well worth its subscription price 
a front page title: is your health making you fat? it was related to some kind of hormones that causes a series of symptoms and make a woman to gain weight waist up 
Ladies Home Journal provides practical advice on how busy women can be happier and more effective. The articles are straightforward, easy to read, interesting, and assume the reader is intelligent (which is more than I can say for many women's magazines). I especially like the health and fitness news because it usually pertains to women exclusively. The celebrity interviews are fun, too, and the recipes are easy enough for anyone to follow and enjoy. I give it four stars because I can always find at least one topic that really interests me in each issue 
This is one of those industry trade journals that they "charge" for but if you are in the business send for free. Visit their site and see if you qualify before you pay for a subscription 
I got a subscription to this magazine as a gift and at first glance, thought it was going to be nothing but lightweight glossy fluff mainly meant to push new products. To be fair, there are plenty of lightweight reviews of new products in each issue, but there are also a surprising number of very useful, practical how-to articles-- mainly geared to novice or intermediate digital photographers (like me!). Yes, I've purchased big thick books on Photoshop before, but somehow, I never gotten to far in actually reading those books (maybe too much info for a hobbiest who doesn't need/won't use 1/2 the features in the product?). I recently switched from using Photoshop to using Photoshop Elements, and this magazine seems to be a nice compliment to that software package. In recent issues, I've learned when and how to effectively use RAW vs JPG, how to take better advantage of graduated ND filters, how to use Levels correctly, etc. The contributing editors are all top-rate as are the photographs and examples. I highly recommend anyone with a new digital SLR and/or new PC image software such as PS Elements, to get this magazine. It's well worth the subscription 
This is one of the best magazine for learning how to take great pictures with your digatal camara 
Rue Morgue is a true horror magazine. You get countless articles on upcoming, recent, and past horror with interviews from writers, directors, stars, and more. There's always tons of reviews on everything from theatrical horror to festival horror to those silly straight to video horrors. Crave more horror on the 'net, then Rue Morgue is always giving you your fill on websites. And what I've always found to be an awesome thing about Rue Morgue ... there's always full page ads of upcoming horror movies which serve as mini-posters, and they're glossy paged. Rue Morgue, you just slashed into my heart and did it right 
I've read The New Yorker since 1963 and though it seemed a better magazine then, it is still a very good magazine now. As magazines go, it may even be one of the best this nation has ever published. For good writing, reporting, cartoons, and opinion one can do no better than this well known magazine. And their occasional special issues offer abundant pages that double their weekly issue. I don't believe any issue in all the years I've read it hasn't had at least a couple items of interest, with some of the issues being read from front cover to back. Try a copy, it might just be for you. Semper Fi 
Although I often disagree with the 'New Yorker' politically and find the writing of Seymour Hersh offensive I believe that the 'New Yorker' publishes exceptionally fine pieces of non- fiction. I stress the non- fiction because this is what interests me in 'the New Yorker now'.Once it was the fiction of Salinger, Singer, of S.J. Perelman. But in recent years it has been the writing of Malcolm Gladwell, Adam Gopin and a number of others. This is without speaking of the special feeling of class the New Yorker gives, its still topnotch cartoons, the 'On the Town' feature, and the first-rate 'Talk of the Town ' calendar 
Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future. What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate. On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics. Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled "Sources" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue. Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day. 
I have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my 2 cents. Yes, the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities. But this is exactly something I want to read and evaluate, the marketplace of business opportunities. Many of these are franchise opportunities, which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start. The articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful, but not all. The value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process. It was not until I read the E-Myth Revisited that I understood the value of these franchises. This magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy. The magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise. Hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there 
It's true that Entrepreneur mag is loaded with ads--but those ads can be interesting in themselves. I always find it fascinating to see what ads pop and what ads are junk--and it's easy to see the difference. This is an opportunity to develop your own advertising strategy! As for the content, there is certainly room for improvement. I personally enjoy the entrepreneur profiles, though I wish they were longer. I would like to see more meat here. Having been in business for several years now, I find the most value in this magazine comes from the front section where they list interesting tips, new products, and survey results. Not a month goes by that I don't bookmark a page so I can follow up on a new product or check out a website mentioned in a short piece. For that alone, the low subscription price is worth the investment. There is a lot of information on franchising, which is great for those interested in this business model. Though this is not my personal cup of tea, I still find it interesting to read the lists of franchises and notice the trends in popularity. Who knew there were so many pet service franchises available! Sure, it could use more real-world advice, but I still consider this one of the best general magazines available for entrepreneurs. Not every topic can appeal to every reader since we all run different kinds of businesses and seek different information. If you're looking for something more specific to your industry, a trade magazine would make more sense. But I still recommend you keep your Entrepreneur mag too so you can keep an eye on the climate of the small biz world. 
This is probably the best magazine I subscribe to. Over the past 5 years I've noticed the quality of my other subscribed videogame magazines to have deteriorated dramatically. But this one stays true. I thought by now one would see a drop in quality, but the quality of the writing just keeps getting stronger and stronger. The demo disc, for example, continues to stay chock with demos of most current and even retro games. The quality of on-line reviews is and continues to get better! I love the CD Rom video tips, and even enjoy just watching the videos of new and upcoming games. Other magazines, especially ones like Gamepro, act like they give you demos, but this is the only magazine that has a demo disc each ad every month. I have even seen these demos for sale on auctions sites on-line (including the Big one that starts with E). I'm one of those gamers that rarely pays full price for videogames, and I appreciate being able to play the demo of some of them, until I feel like paying for them. Amazon is a great site to get used videogames on the cheap, and I appreciate the reviews helping me to make a decision to buy the game. Hope this review helps somebody. MC White said: CHECK IT OUT!! 
I have been subscribed to this mag since before PS2 came out, and it has always proved to offer reliable, well explained and accurate reviews, as well as early previews and interesting articles. Not only is it good to read, but it comes with a demo disc, which is packed with demos, video previews, game files, and other helpful and interesting features. If you are trying to choose one mag to subscribe to, this is the one you want 
What is not to like, from cover to cover. All beautiful models and international models. Great magazine 
It did take a little while to get to me, but still happy with the experience 
Harper's always takes chances to get noticed. This can be good or bad depending on your tolerance for shock factor i.e. Britney Spears naked, pregnant and with black hair. It's worth a salon read 
I THOUGHT MY FIRST ISSUE OF YOUR MAGAZINE WAS A LITTLE SPARSE. IT WAS A VERY THIN ISSUE. THE MODELS WERE BEAUTIFUL. THIS WAS GOOD.BUT YOU KNOWIF YOU WOULD INCLUDE MORE IN DEPTH ARTICLESSUCH AS REALLY IN DEPTH STUFF ABOUT SKIN AND HAIR. LIKE I SAID BEFORE AGING SKIN NEEDS MORE DONE TO IT AND SOME THINGS LIKE MICRO-DERMABRASION COULD BE HELPFUL. ALSO 8 GLASSES A WATER A DAY IS THE MOST HELPFUL THING A WOMAN COULD DO FOR HERSELF. BESIDE PLASTIC SURGERY,THERES NOT MUCH FOR THEM TO DO. BUT I WILL SAYTHIS, TO ENLARGE LIPS I PUT A VITAMIN E CAPSULE ON MY LIPS, AND THEN HONEY AND THEN A GOOD LIP MOISTURIZER AND LEAVE IT ON OVERNIGHT. IT DOEES MAKE THE LIPS PLUMPER. ALSO I USE BABY POWDER ON MY FACE AS A FACE POWDER. SOMETIMES I USE THIS JUST ON MY NOSE AND CHIN. SOMETIMES I USE HALF MAYONAISE AND CONDITIONER AND MIX THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE THE MAYONAISE SMELL BETTER ON THE HAIR. SOMETIMES I USE VITAMIN OIL IN MY BATH WATER SUCH AS VITAMIN E A PERSON CAN BUY THIS AT THE DOLLAR STORE. IM NOT RICH BUT I DO SOME THINGS TO HELP THE WAY I LOOK AT MY AGE. THEN YOU COULD INCLUDE PICTURES OF MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS AND STORIES OF PEOPLE . THEN YOU COULD HAVE ARTICLES ON CELEBRITIES LIKE FRANK CONVERSE,ROBERT BLAKE,REALLY INTERESTING ONES LIKE THAT. PAUL NEWMAN HAS ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY INTERESTING. ALSO WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ACTOR RICHARD HATCH WHO STARRED IN THE HITCHHIKERS? someone told me the other day that the most handsome actor there was or is was yul brynner. i didnt see that as i should. i dont know if you agree with that or not but it would be interesting to see a profile of the way he lived .i like brad pitt and those people are always great. i love jennifer anniston because she she is higher up than most women in her thoughts and actions.angelina jolie i really like too beacause women do like these women. i miss johnny carson and they really need to find someone to replace him. yes there is people like that still in the world. ive found some of them. well thank you 
Harper's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine, second only to InStyle. It is great and packed with great fashion. It actually does have some good articles too that I thoroughly enjoy reading. (The articles are MUCH better than the ones in Elle.) If you can only get one sub, get InStyle. If you can get two, get InStyle and Harper's Bazaar. It is well-worth the money 
... in the U.S. is Harper's Bazaar. You need only check out the recent covers in black and white, featuring Charlize Theron and Demi Moore, to see why this mouthwatering magazine is the high water mark for the best of the best of what's on offer at the supermarket check out stands stateside. In a market crowded with magazines which look increasingly the same and seem to recycle the identical set of celebrity photos over and over again (snooze), Bazaar has cast an eye on the illustrious typography and design sense of its own past years. The results are evident on every glossy page, with very little of the guilty aftertaste here that you'll surely feel after flipping through the advertising book that is any issue of its bloated, mainstream market competitors. Are the clothes ridiculously expensive for all but the richest among us? Of course. Do we really care about who showed up at what swanky party in NYC? Probably not. Will we ever look like any of those models? Darlin', you jest! But we do care (admit it) about the fantasy, the luxe, the allure of beautiful clothes on beautiful people -- they're lovely to behold, it's only natural, and it's fun -- you could do a lot worse than dropping a few bucks on this class act and its peer in the "shelter" magazines group, House and Garden. Another magazine not overstuffed with ads and perfumes and heavy on design sophistication, also highly recommended. I'm sure she's a perfectly lovely person, but I have to say that the recent spread featuring the Duchess of Cornwall (that'd be Prince Chuck's new wife, Camilla) sitting at her vanity with an iPod in her ear was somewhat less than captivating ... unless you count all of the delicious little Corgis showing off at her feet (and I do) ... I don't understand how this got in, but sometimes these things are random, and she is after all the royal consort. Ho hum. Just a blip on the Bazaar radar. Excepting things like that, way to go, Bazaar! Show them how it's done! 
Harper's Bazaar is the very best fashion and high style magazine out there, nothing compared to the always disappointing Vogue. Better fashions, editorials, articles that I actually want to read and keepsake editions that are just classics. The true bible if you want to be in style 
As a subscriber to Newsweek for the last 2 years, I'm happy to endorse it. The topics covered which interest me the most involve national/world politics and science; however, I'm pleased to discover other subjects covered that I wouldn't typically seek out(entertainment, religion, etc.). I'm puzzled by the ranting of other negative reviews. While it's not perfect, I consider Newsweek to be solid overall in its coverage and general interest 
i love newsweek. its the perfect mix of important news and interesting stories. articals arent too long, i like the frequent sidebars that help to break down the information. great value. 
I watch CNN, too. When there is a big story, I get parts of it on CNN, then Newsweek comes and it fills in with a larger story, the bigger picture in a way that I understand. Then I relate to other news sources as a more informed listener/reader. If it in fact has a liberal bias, I have not detected it, but I tend to have a slightly liberal bias myself, so I can't speak to that. I buy Time on the newstand when there is something that seems to be particularly well covered in Time. I do not consider Newsweek lesser. I used to take Time years ago. Now I prefer Newsweek. The only complaint I might have is that both magazines seem to be having more "magazine", or feature type stories, that I do not see as "news" and am not interested in. I think that is driven by these magazines (both Time and Newsweek do it) attempt to find out what works in this expanding world of media. Ninety percent of those human interest subjects are not my interest and that annoys me. But the few that speak to me, yes, I will buy a magazine for that. For instance if Time has a good article on the older groups of people in America, I will buy that single issue. At the same time I am usually disappointed in whatever is featured in either magazine if it is not news driven. Newsweek has been my news magazine that comes in the mail for years. For me, it remains my choice. Mary P Jones 
Newsweek is an easy to read and interesting magazine. However, it is not as balanced as the Economist or Time Magazine but does come up with some interesting articles on developments worldwide. If you ignore the conservative slant of the magazine, you can enjoy the coverage and analysis of various current world events. Newsweek helps me to keep up with developments in a diverse range of subjects including business and society, international affairs, politics, arts and other areas. I also appreciate its compact yet comprehensive nature. The magazine helps put news into context. For instance, I was often frustrated during the recent Israeli-Hezbollah conflict in Lebanon as I could see the news on TV but did not understand the story behind the news. However, after I read about the conflict in Newsweek, I got to know the background going back into decades and I could now appreciate all the news stories in their proper context. 
This was my weekly newsmag when I was a student and starving artist. Itï¿½s a budget priced version of Time. As I got older and more established financially, I found that I wanted the same from my main weekly news and pop-culture sourcebook, so I switched to time. The information is not much different. It's kinda like Hertz and Avis. Now that I can afford it, I just prefer to be with #1 instead of #2 
Photo Techniques Magazine can help serious photgraphers hone their craft, with extensive tutorials on shooting, printing, Photoshop, scanning, and other topics. It's invaluable for both film and digital photographers. Film photographers will treasure this publication because it's one of the few that still provides tips on traditional film photography and darkroom work, even with medium format and large format cameras. Where else will you find artciles about toning? This publication deserves your support. Once it's gone, it's unlikely we'll see anything like it again 
This is the best photo mag for those of us passionate about photography. It has long in debth articles on technique and equipment. Moreover it features "how to" examples from some of the best fine art photographers of our time. It is thus quite different from other magazines that feature some no name staff writer pretending to be Paul Strand. This does make this magazine perhaps less than ideal for the first time casual shutterbug trying out his/her first pocketcam. But for all of us striving to do good photography this magazine has no peer. It is not a glossy magazine and its print quality is rather low. It is a far cry from Phototechnik International or Spoon, but it is about the creating of rather then the displaying of photographs. Having read every photomagazine in the english and german speaking worlds in the last 15 years this is the best 
The articles are fun I've learned alot of useful information, like last month's article on depression - the fish oil exercise worked almost immediately. It's not a professional or academic journal - if you're a general person on the street, you will learn a lot about psychology 
If you are looking for the quality of an APA journal, this is not one. But if you love the field of psychology as I do, it's a fun and relevant periodical. Kind of a Enquirer of Psychology. I find it a fun read when I'm relaxing, but be careful of their interpretation of research. You know how that can go. It's also got a flavor of Maxim or Cosmo type topics. Sex, relationships, dating, what do men/women like as well as diet/nutrition. Overall recommended 
May be pricy, but it's hard to beat. Can order significantly cheaper direct through www.uncutsubs.co.uk 
very much lives up to it's name by focusing on the Past the present. the free offer of a Disc makes this cool. the magazine has some really good Interviews as well 
Uncut is without a doubt the best music mag in the world right now....but why on earth would anyone buy 12 issues for the price of 15? This mag is 8 bucks in any of the stores mentioned in the other reviews here, not 11 an issue which is what this subscription breaks down to....whats up with that? Also, if you get a subscription direct from Uncut's wesite, it's literally half the price they're selling it for here 
Some times I feel like it was written just for me. The music articles cover everything from classic rock and punk through the best of what is going on today. The movie articles have a great balance between reevaluating the great 70s and 80s films and new movies. Plus the free CDs every month are usually outstanding and have introduced me to new music I would have missed. It's an absolute must have 
I'll get to the point ... if you are looking to stay abreast of what's going on in popular music, including the Indie scene, the Americana world and the major elders still around, this is as far as you need to go. The quality of the writing, be it an in-depth article (many of which are excellent) or a short review (you can expect about 200 per issue) is consistently high. Furthermore, I have been introduced to many great bands that don't even show up in any domestic magazine's radar, although -ironically- many of these bands are American. So, if you can't believe that best it gets is Spin or, much worse, Rolling Stone (how did it ever got to the low point of having Jessica Simpson on the cover ... yikes!), you will be immensely rewarded by trying Uncut. Tip: you can get any single issue at B&amp;N, Borders or Tower Records for the same amount, that way if you don't like it you won't have to mourn 100 bucks 
This is the one that I subscribe to, even though, strictly speaking, Q magazine does a better job of covering contempo musica mondo. Uncut is for those of us who feel nostalgic for popular music figures whose stuff has held up over time. The writing is superior, VASTLY superiour to anything in print today. This is because the mag is staffed by geezers who cut their teeth writing for the likes of the NME and probably something like the top of the pops back in the day. The writers are veterans and this is good for a number of reasons, among them is that they bring great perspective, journalistic professionalism, acute insights, otherwise forgotten trivia and the realization there is more to life than just listening to the tunes, i.e. there is a whole other culture happening simultaneously, to their writing. Actually, apart from the FEATURE ARTIST feature, this magazine is more about film, past and present, and I love this aspect of it because the editors choose an actor, director, genre or actor/director and focus in on the oevre of xhosen subject and then just lay out a whole wackawackapacka stuff that you are definitely going to go out and buy/ rent/ borrow and view. I ALWAYS find a new movie that I have just GOT to watch after reading my latest edition of UNCUT. Plus, each issue comes with a complimentary CD. The selections on these CD's is spotty and I find that the poor ones I spin through just a couple of times, the good ones, I keep and play lots. You won't be sorry that you subscribed to this mag but you will likely be sorry that you didn't if you ever get the chance to see what you missed by not doing so 
Well, it might not be quite the same level as Rolling Stone, remember clout and tradition have something to do with the interviews THEY can get. The writing and reviews are a lot better... since it's British it gives quite a different spin on things and emphasizes other than the mainstream. The downside is the price...You do get a free cd, which is cool I guess 
I absolutely love this magazine. I find amazing things I never new off and especially the new inventing are very interesting 
This is a great magazine for those who are curious. Every month is packed with a wide range of interesting articles on diverse scientific subjects. A lot of fun, and very stimulating 
Popular Science is a great magazine. I love to look at the new stuff coming out. The amount Tof ads inside is the only downside to this magazine. Almost half the magazine is fullpage ads 
This is a very nice magazine for those who like to stay up on current and possible future technologies! I love to read the articles about technologies that may come in the future or that are in the design and research process 
Okay, I've read the other reviews that call this publication shallow, lacking in depth, geared toward young teenagers, etc. I guess if you are looking for twenty page, in-depth technical articles that delve into every minute neutron of a particular subject, then yes, this publication might not be what you're looking for. But, if you're a regular, average, ordinary guy like me (who would not understand those deep, brainy articles anyway) and you are looking for an entertaining, informative view onto what's new and what's cool, I think you'll be pleased. Very pleased! Take, for example, a couple of recent issues (see the date of when this review was written). Last month was focused on the future of personal aviation and the people behind the effort to make personal flight more available and affordable, and about the aircrafts they are inventing. Fascinating! Now, can I run out and build myself a prototype after reading the articles? Ummm, no. Do I know a whole lot more about an incredibly fun subject then I did before? Yes! This month's issue focuses on similar theme: The future of personal space travel and the idea of a space-hotel. When you're done reading it will you be able to build a rocket and fly to the moon? Of course not. But it's informative and educational to the exact level I would want it to be... just enough to make me aware, enlightened, and entertained. So to all the non-nerds, non-rocket scientists, and non-brainiacs who want a scientific publication by the people, for the people, I think your yearly subscription money will be well spent. Enjoy 
Touchstone is one of the better magazines/journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past. The editors, numerous in number, are Orthodox, Roman, and Protestant Christians who take seriously the creeds and scriptures of the Church. In other words, they realize that Tradition is the glue that holds the Church together, and by extension, sanitizes and sanctifies culture. First Things is also an excellent journal that you will want to check out as well. Enjoy! 
This is a conservative magazine from the perspective of protestism, catholicism, and eastern orthodoxy. The perspective is based on the Bible and Early Church Councils. This is a good magazine, I recommend it 
As an owner of a wonderful loving pit bull dog, I adore this magazine because every issue there are pit bull faces smiling at me. I love the insightful articles, the wonderful vendors. I love this magazine! Thank you for all you do 
I like that The Bark ISN'T a monthly magazine. I usually get sick of a magazine after a while. When another one comes, reading it just seems like something to add to my "to-do" list. But I'm always happy to see the beautifully photographed cover of The Bark when it arrives. I've subscribed for several years and have seen it go from something that could barely be called a magazine to its current slick and fabulous format. 
I've received and read one issue of The Bark so far. I am amazed at the great pictures of dogs (posed and in action). It's a fun magazine to relax with and enjoy. The articles are well written, and very interesting. I'm glad that I treated myself to this subscription. Usually, I stick with Dog Fancy, The Whole Dog Journal, Your Dog, and Dog World, as they serve the very necessary topics of wellness, what to do/not do, meeting the breed, and much more. The Bark is intelligent and modern 
Seriously, I perused the Summer 05 issue in a reading/tv area of a large corporation and was tempted to take it home. It was outstanding. I will subscribe 
This is an extremely "well rounded" magazine! I thoroughly enjoy every issue. Bark covers all issues concerning dogs. From articles on veterinary issues, understanding your dogs behaviour, dog gear....and outstanding well written short stories and articles written by people about their dogs and how they have impacted their lives. Very enjoyable reading....from cover to cover. I highly recommend Bark. If you get your "paws" on your first copy, you will definitely look forward to the next 
Every issue is so exciting you'll look forward to buy/receive them in your mailbox every 2 months!beautiful pictures,neat ads and so many articles(some really touching!).they focuses probably more on real life heroes rather than celebrities which makes them unique 
This is one of the best dog magazines of all time. The issues just keep getting better and better. This magazine goes beyond purebreds and honors mixed-breeds as well. It has wonderful rescue-related stories. One of the other reviewers compared the quality of the articles in this magazine with that of NPR. That comparison really opened my eyes as I have for years enjoyed and appreciated the quality and fairness of the information provided by NPR. 
This magazine is packed with great articles. It's one of the only magazines I read from cover to cover. A MUST for any dog lover. A perfect gift for a dog lover. 
This is a good place to get idea's for small businesses. I like to get idea's from people who have thought of it and the business works. But be more careful cause i think some of them only works for certain cases only. Try taking a look at this magazine and be your own judge on the quality of this magazine 
My husband got this magazine in hopes of finding ideas for starting a home based business. He admits, that he is jealous that I work from home and get to spend so much time with the kids. As a work at home expert, (I am founder of WebMomz.com and have written a book on the subject) I QUITE familiar with the subject matter. THESE GUYS HAVE DONE THEIR HOMEWORK! There is a wealth of information in here. They offer both entreprenuer type businesses AND "franchise" type ideas for the "not-so-creative" home biz wanna-be. I found myself bookmarking pages left and right. I have read some others that are all MLM hype - no thank you. Small Biz Opportunities is the REAL THING with REAL opportunities. Overall an Excellent Magazine 
I've been to a lot of concerts, met a lot of bands, seen a lot of hype, seen a lot of scandal. This magazine is pretty much the best source of any up-and-coming band that you may be hearing on the radio or seeing on MTV. Not only is SPIN the best magazine for music for "kids my age (22)" but the picture quality is some of the best quality that I have seen in any magazine. I have framed pages out of previous spin magazines, because they were pictures I wanted to keep forever. I would recommend spin magazine to any fan of indie rock especially. Death cab for cutie, the shins, and the flamming lips are just some of the bands that are talked about in SPIN magazine monthly. SPIN magazine does include some rap/hip-hop music that I try to avoid but the indie-rock and rock band information that I receive is some of the best. 
SPIN covers pretty much every type of rock music out there...like electronic, altevernative, metal, EVERYTHING. They don't sugarcoat anything, and it's really funny at times. Definetly 5 stars 
I picked up a copy of British Vogue when I had finished reading my American Vogue for the month, interested in the British Vogue and its take on fashion, plus I've had subscriptions to British magazines in the past and was impressed with them. There are many, many things that set this magazine apart from American Vogue. First, this magazine's main focus is fashion. They devote more space to models than celebrities, socialites, or noblility types. They don't only focus on the high and unreachable fashions but also feature more affordable clothing (granted, its mostly at British stores, but the thought counts) . The articles in British Vogue are more educated, and they cover more ground. Another thing I really liked was that this magazine not only shows fashions and trends but also shows you HOW to put them together, what mixes with what, and what you should be looking at getting. They also talk about staple pieces in this magazine, how and where to buy those. This magazine also has a pride for country that you don't see in the U.S. anymore which is a breath of fresh air. The snootiness of American Vogue, the parading around couture only, the $900 first night sets and whatnot are left out of this magazine. It almost seems like this magazine is more practical than its American counterpart. Lastly, this magazine is of higher quality, with full, glossy pages, a glossy cover, and is overall about 2 inches bigger all the way around than its American counterpart. This magazine is very, very good, I just wish a subscription were more affordable. 
Nylon magazine is amazing, with a creative touch no other magazine has. Based in the great NYC, this magazine oozes creative sophitcativeness, originality, and a sarcastic charm with amazing fashion, art, and espicially music. The photography is pure genius and the layout will just want you to flip through the magazine again and again. Witty journalist contemplate to the magazine's superiority, who are honest, witty, charming and sarcastic. If you have any taste for underground culture come pick up Nylon magazine now 
as a high school student aspiring to attend art school, nylon has provided me with countless sources of inspiration in their creative photography, layout, and decoration. i look forward to reading the magazine each month, and i honestly devour every last word and picture. nylon is a creative, whimsical and fantastic magazine. i highly reccomend it to anyone interested in a fashion magazine that goes beyond a "beach read. 
Since the first time I picked up Nylon a few years ago, I fell in love. The layout is great (as an artist, I'm always inspired by the great pictures). It offers a great variety of articles pertaining to music, fashion, art and pop culture. It's definitely a great escape from the masses of bubblegum girly fashion mags that dominate these days 
I was so happy to pick up Meridian. It's a great mix of fiction and poetry and I couldn't put it down until I finished it 
I have been reading History Today for years. It covers largely European, and especially British, history, with occasional articles on American and world history. Articles are written by established scholars and sound popular historians, such as Antonia Fraser and Alison Weir, and are accompanied by brief bibliographies. Illustrations are usually drawn from sources contemporary with the subject of the article. Its only drawback for Americans is the price. However, after years of freeloading in libraries, I decided to get a subscription. Believe me, it is worth it. 
By far and beyond the best history periodical I have come across. And consistantly one of the best magazines I have read. I have subscribed for three years now-and that says a lot for me, especially given the price, since most magazines don't keep my interest for longer than a year. I find myself dropping anything I am currently reading, magazines and books alike, until I have finished each one. Easy to read and yet usually contains much detail that you can sink your teeth into. The articles do a fantastic job of appealing to both the uninformed and the seasoned student of history. Ever have one of those teachers that would tell a story and then, at the end, after being rivited by the narrative, you actually found you had learned something in a way that made you feel almost as if you had experienced it yourself? Well, many times I find that this magazine does just that. Every now and then they do get a little fluffy but all in all, unbeatable 
in a world where hype and superficial journalism has reached new dimensions, the new yorker is an amazing world in itself. there goes rarely an article left unread by the time a new issue arrives, the lure of many worlds to explore and promise to really learn about life as it is now. most of all, it's definitely worth the time. 
The New Yorker has made it's way to our kitchen table since I was tall enough to see over the edge of the table. My Mom was an avid reader and now I buy the magazine, cause she would have wanted it that way. I like it for the cartoons and I'm absolutely naive when it comes to politics, so I need this magazine to get some idea of what is going on. With all the Blogging and other nonsense, I feel secure that the New Yorker does diligent fact checking before it prints something, so I rely on it where I won't rely on news printed on the internet. Regards, Lar 
Along with the New York Review of Books, The New Yorker is a must weekly read for me. I read it, cover to cover except for the ads, for 45 minutes to an hour each night before sleep. Roger Angell on baseball is the best; Lane and Denby tag teamming on the movie reviews; Joan Acocella on dance (Dance! I've read more about it than I've ever seen), and the list goes on. Left wing? Several reviewers here said the magazine is left wing. This is hilarious. Obviously these people have never read a left wing maqgazine, and such comments only illustrate the extent to which the political spectrum in the US has shifted rightward. For left wing try: The Nation, The Progressive, Dissent, or Monthly Review. The New Yorker is as middle brow bourgeois as it gets 
I have been a reader for 20 years, but am considering canceling my subscription (I did this once before when it became a Vanity Fair look-alike under Tina Brown). I think the writing is exceptional. My complaint is that the issues have become thinner (with an embarrassingly small "Double-Issue" mid-August). The articles are shorter and edited to end at the bottom of a page, which sometimes breaks the article's flow. It is full of advertising, which pays the bills, but now seems to have squeezed out some of the writing. The articles also do not seem as essential as they had in the past. The political writing is great and the movie reviews by Lane and Denby are the best you will find. 
I got to read this magazine in my local library where you can actually check out magazines and keep them for a week. Soon decided to subscribe it instead of running to the library everyweek. What I like about this magazine is the time it takes for me to finish one article is about the same amount of time it takes me to get tired and want to go to sleep after reading. It covers a variety of issues, such as world politics, health, environment, art, you name it. One thing I need to point out is, English is my second language, so it also helps me improve my vocabulary. And I totally agree with one of the previous reviews, that is you never get to read 3/4 of its content, one thing is certain for me, I never read its fictions. 
New Yorker is one of the best magazines available in the US. It has a good mixture of articles on current events, culture, fiction, humor. And one shouln't forget those notorious cartoons. The lengths of the articles range from the very long to the very short, and should amply sustain one's weekly need for reading material. Please be aware that all articles have a coat of liberal paint. But the New Yorker is probably the most sensible left of center media source in this country 
I have been subscribing to the New Yorker for five years now, and it has been a very enlightening experience. The New Yorker does its part in covering big news stories, but it's not really a news magazine. The perspectives are unique (and admittedly lean to the left), and the kind you're not likely to get elsewhere. The authors use the first person because they tend to be part of the stories they're covering. Take Jon Lee Anderson, probably the most credible reporter covering the Middle East today. His "Letters From" various cities involve accounts of his meetings with locals and leaders. Other segments are more like NPR stories--unique perspectives on largely uncovered topics that aren't time-sensitive. You'll get in-depth looks into developments in medicine, law, architecture, etc., that otherwise wouldn't get on your radar unless you were in that profession. And, the writers incorporate the "larger questions" in stories focused on recent events. Like Malcolm Gladwell's recent account of a playwright who plagiarized material from a former article written by him. He parlayed his personal struggle into a good summary of legal and ethical positions on the use or development of one person's idea by another. I have grown to look forward to reading the Fiction selection each week. Sometimes I don't like the piece, but I enjoy getting the chance to read writers that I normally wouldn't and those that I normally would. Additionally, the magazine has added more dedicated issues--most recently the "Food" issue, in addition to standbys like the "Style" and "Fiction" issues. I loved the "Food" issue, especially one writer's account of the search for truly authentic pasta that involved a work night in Mario Batali's kitchen and a trip to Italy. I enjoy the balance of hard news, balanced interest stories, and arts that the New Yorker provides. I began my subscription to get a different perspective than what I got from local Southern news, and I keep it for the same reasons and many more 
The New Yorker has a lot to offer as a magazine but it's a mixed bag. Some weeks it has excellent feature articles on topics I'm very interested in and other weeks not. I used to subscribe but now I buy off the newsstand when the topics it covers are of particular interest. The New Yorker should get raves for being a serious and somewhat intellectual magazine. The feature articles are very in-depth and are from top-notch investigative journalists. The magazine's coverage of Al Queda, terrorism, Afghanistan, and the intelligence community have been absolutely superb. It falters a little, in my opinion, on its coverage of national politics. Nevertheless, typically the feature articles are meaty and in-depth, if sometimes a bit dry and tedious. The rest of the magazine is also a mixed bag. I don't live in New York city so the city specific stuff is of little interest to me. A lot of times the weekly features are interesting and other times not. Overall I rate the magazine highly, but it's not one that I would read on a weekly basis. 
I order this magazine for my wife. She is a good cook but is enchanted with the magazin 
I've been very pleased with my subscription to Fine Cooking. As another reviewer mentioned, it's printed on nice quality paper, and on every page are at least 4-5 pictures in full color. The pictures are certainly helpful, but the recipes are also fantastic, and the nifty calorie chart at the end (a la Cooking Light) is a nice touch. Also, it doesn't have a distracting ad in between every other page like Bon Appetit. My only complaint is that it doesn't come twice a month 
A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years, writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry". With more than 500 cookbooks in my collection I am typically disappointed by food magazines. If you like watching America's Test Kitchen you will love this magazine. The editors cover equipment reviews, cookbooks, develop new recipes in their test kitchen and pass along reader's tips. If you love to cook, give this magazine a chance. I think this magazine is better than the original that it emulated. In the June 2006 issue this magazine features the following articles: Weeknight Grilling Rich, Fudgy Brownies Two Ways Make Room for Basil A Shortcut to Juicy Chicken Chopped Salads Making the Best Quesadillas Cuisine: Vietnam Berry Tarts For those cooks that like to make everything, they even include a recipe for homemade tortilla shells (a foreign process to those of use without Latino heritage). The editors include an easy to use recipe index in the front of the magazine that is segmented by type of recipe (appetizers, meat poultry, desserts, etc.). In short I have enjoyed every issue of this magazine that I have read. I would highly recommend this magazine to anyone that is serious about cooking or eating. 
Like the others on here, I have to give Fine Cooking 5 stars. Pros - The price is worth it, there are delectable pictures for every recipes. The mag is on high gloss and beautiful to look at. - There are recipes in them that make an average cook a better cook, even if you don't use a recipe it gives you ideas. - Reviews of new gadgets - Focus on a specific food, like vanilla. - The company when I contacted them about a type of recipe I was looking for took the time to go through their back issues and send me full color copies of what they could find on the subject - that was very cool. Cons - I have one issue where I didn't find one recipe I wanted to make. - I use maybe 2-3 recipes out of each issue. I'm just not willing to devote hours to making a dish that while it looks beautiful I don't like the ingredients in it. - They use alcohol for some recipes where it's crucial for the flavoring, bad part is I don't drink/use alcohol. I made a big pot of beef stew from an issue where red wine was the main flavor. I tried to substitute but a can of Dinty Moore stew tasted better. If you really want to know what's in it. Check out their website, they have recipes from the issues. Or browse through them at the store and see if it's what you're looking for. So far after many a search Fine Cooking is the best I've come across that can appease to the stay at home cook and the gourmet looking for a challenge. You might also want to follow the contributors. I found my best bread chef Peter Rienhart from it. The Focaccia in one issue is so good you'll drool, even though it takes two days to make 
Fine Cooking takes a somewhat Consumer Reports-like approach to cooking, much in the manner of Cook's Illustrated. But there are several key differences that set FC apart and make it superior to CI: 1. In FC, not all the voices sound alike. In CI, every article, no matter who writes it, sounds as though it were written by the same person. I understand why they do this (keeping the focus on the food not personality, maintaining consistency), but it gives the magazine a creepy, musty, claustrophic, Stepford Wives-like quality. This is magnified by the fact that there are no "outsiders" allowed into the CI kitchen--no visiting experts, no star chefs, just the CI staff and their identical voices. 2. In FC there's no Christopher Kimball essays: CI's bow-tied editor fills up an entire page in an already thin magazine with a folksy, Prairie Home Companion-like homily on why owning a large, upscale farm in rural New England makes him morally superior to everyone else, replete with a recurring cast of curmudgeonly cranks and crackpots--all of which has absolutely nothing to do with any of the food in the issue, or with the lives of anyone else on the planet, with the possible exception of Martha Stewart. It's an embarrassing, self-indulgent soapbox. But he is leader of the cult, so don't expect his sermons to dispappear any time soon. 3. CI advertises itself as "ad-free"--and then proceeds to glut its pages with print ads and blow-in cards touting CI's cottage industry of recycled books. I'd rather peruse the offerings of FC's advertisers, whose products are at least potentially useful to me. 4. FC has no constantly recycled material. For such a supposedly modest operation, CI puts out a staggering number of books, many of them single-topic tomes that borrow heavily from the recipes already printed in the magazine, as well as from other, previously published CI books (and there's an evil twin in the "America's Test Kitchen" series of books and DVDs). You're likely to find the same pie crust or tomato sauce recipe in about 16 different books. The incestuous nature of this recipe factory casts an unflattering mercenary shadow across the CI mission. 5. FC offers superior quality production methods. The glossy paper and attractive, full-color photos in FC put CI's faux-downhome matte paper and hand-drawn illustrations to shame. 6. FC has much more variety. FC also has its own group of regular contributors, but they are supplemented in each issue with experts from a variety of fields in the culinary arts (and who write in their own unique voice--imagine that!), giving the magazine a broader scope and a much fresher feel than CI, which tends to stick to a standard set of All-American classics, which they recycle every five years (how many times can you revamp "The Secrets of Macaroni and Cheese"?). Give Fine Cooking a look. It's hands-down the best food magazine for home cooks 
As a cooking school instructor, I believe there are only four pieces of reading material a home cook needs: "Fine Cooking", Corriher's "Cookwise", "The Food Lover's Companion", and Goldstein's "Wine Lover's Cookbook". Your magazine has it all: excellent cooking tips; first-rate articles rating various appliances and cooking tools; excellent pictures detailing procedures; and recipes that are error-free with ingredients listed in the order in which they are used in the instructions (a pet peeve of mine!). I agree with a recent review stating that the level of difficulty in your recipes encourages stretching one's cooking abilities but not to the poit of giving up. In the past years I have really liked that you have highlighted a small grower or breeder on the back cover--one on goat cheese and another on apples come to mind. To all the editors and contributors: keep up the wonderful work 
My husband and I both love to cook, and some of our new favorites come from this magazine. The reviews are informative, the recipes taste great (and are not overly complicated), and the basic cooking suggestions are helpful. The magazine likes to pick a theme for the month (or several) which has a couple of benefits. 1. You can cook a meal right from one issue and it all tastes great together and 2. You have several options for one basic idea. For example one month there was a whole article on rice pilaff which starting with the basics (so you could modify the basic recipe your own way) and then gave several variations. Best I have found out there so far 
I just picked JANE up off the newsstands - and am thrilled that there is finally a womens magazine out there of substance. The music references as well as the humorous tone are refreshing!! Thank you JANE for having a different voice!! 
My friends and I love this magazine even more now that Brandon Holley is the Editor. The fashion, music, celebrity technology content is even better. Amazing! 
I love JANE mag these days! It's like a total bible for my life - the fashion is so cute and I can actually afford the stuff in there! It's got so much color and energy - I was inspirired by every page. No articles on diets or how to plz men. I want to hang and go shopping with all the writers and girls in the magazine - cool smart chicks who still love fashion :) No other women's magazine has such cool pages on beauty, all the others write about botox, but JANE doesn't do that. And love the "pranks" - the world needs to laugh a little more! 
This magazine is my absolute favorite, I feel like the editors are people I'd actually be friends with. I also check out French mags like Jalouse for their fashion and JANE feels more like that than a typical American mag. The music reviews are right on, a great mix of indy and pop. Plus this is the only magazine that actually makes me laugh out loud when I read it. 
Just got my subscription and Jane ROCKS! Finally, a women's magazine that has great fashion AND a sense of humor! Jane's really is different from everything else out there. I love it! 
I'm in love with the October Jane cover w/ Christina Aguilera, she looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g! What I love about Jane is their total understanding of 20 yr olds, UM ME! The magazine has gone through quite a re-vamp, loved the Bonnaoo piece. I was there this summer and it was awesome! So needless to say, I had to sign up for a year subscription of Jane 
LOVE JANE....the new editor really knows how to put together a magazine that really speaks to me me. FASHION, BEAUTY, MUSIC what else could a girl ask for. THIS IS A MUST READ, MUST SUBSCRIBE 
Wow, I've just picked up my third issue of JANE (I think it's October) and I have to say, I am HOOKED. I've been checking it out since I saw the cover with Heidi Klum. Great band information that already makes me feel cooler, and the fashion is beyond amazing. I keep staring at the mailbox, waiting for the next issue. Jenny, 2 
just read the October issue of JANE and i love the story on Bonnaroo! JANE always has a way of highlighting great fashions and amazing music...my 2 favorite things! -katie c Austin, T 
This is a great magazine offering not only information on general health, but also more specific problems we have today. It focuses on several different topics an issue and provides resources to go to and gain more knowledge. For anyone interested in a more natural approach to todays medicine, food etc. 
I'm one of those people who always looks up product reviews before buying ANYTHING, so it was on a leap of faith that I bought Natural Health magazine without reading anything about it. A friend suggested it, and since this particular friend has never led me wrong before, I caved in and bought the July/August 2005 copy immediately. Let me start off by saying that I'm an extremely picky person. I have extremely high standards for every purchase I make, and I absolutely will not cut a manufacturer any slack if I find a fault. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I will mention that I was thoroughly impressed with Natural Health. Long ago, I subscribed to New Age magazine (now known as Body Soul, which I do not care for). It was among my favorites solely due to its wide variety of content and true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips and advice. I cannot stand redundancy, incorrect information and excessive advertising. I found that Natural Health was much more long the lines of the former New Age magazine, filled with dozens of little gems that make it worth much more than the $3.95 I paid. To give you an idea of what the magazine includes, here is a small sampling of the articles I found in the July/August issue: Small articles include: - "To bee or not to bee", a breakdown on aromatherapy ingredients that include bee pollen, royal jelly, propolis, and honey, stating just how effective and natural these ingredients are. - "How can I get relief from PMS?" Experts (including a Naturopath, Gynecologist and Dietitian) answer this question with excellent responses. - "Medicine Cabinet: attack of the weekend warrior" Natural remedies and aids for those like myself who love to be weekend warriors. - "Clothes to pose in" Great yoga gear! - "Medical Breakthroughs" - "Healing Supplements: 8 ways to beat anxiety" - "Fitness Fix - knee savers" Longer articles include: - "Healthy Appetites: savvy strategies for eating well" Delicious, healthy recipes and tips. - "Good medicine: a clean, healthy mouth" A well-researched article on "mercury fillings, fluoride toothpaste and the best at-home remedies". - "Five Paths to Peace" Five simple meditation techniques. - "Eat to Beat The Heat: Yin Foods" More great recipes! - "Sacred Spaces" - making your home your personal retreat. This is only a sampling; in fact, that's less than half of the magazine alone. Some articles are fairly short, but provide just the right amount of information to get the point across. My personal favorite was the last page, "Make One Change", where this month's change is to "upgrade your z's". It included simple tips that I was able to implement immediately. The amount of advertising seemed slightly less than usual (probably about the same amount as you'd find in a Yoga Journal, but not nearly as many as in Oprah magazine), and they seemed to be in line with the natural health focus. Judging by the past reviews on Natural Health, it seems the magazine had a bad run in the 2003-2004 timeframe. Let's remember that magazines change editors frequently. I found none of the past complaints to be true in this issue, but that may not be so in future issues years from now. As for me, I want a subscription ASAP 
I guess I don't have the agendas of other reviewers. I prefer to use organic foods, healthcare, and body products, and find this magazine offers much useful information on alternatives to conventional offerings. I am not familiar with the "old" Natural Health magazine, maybe it was more "earthy-crunchy" or something, but I found nothing offensive in the "new" format. I would recommend this magazine to my mother and my siblings and friends, who I'd like to see dip their toes into the world of natural health/beauty/food products. Just be aware that not everything in here is purely organic. I find this magazine much less offensive than "Organic Style", which in its last issue had models wearing leather coats, uber expensive consumer goods, and advertising from merchandisers who are definitely NOT on the organic band wagon 
Filter and Under the Radar are the only music magazines I come near. I hear Mojo is just as informative, renovative, and enjoyable, but I'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres I... don't care much about. Fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling "indie"/alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/!!!!, take a gander at this. And the covers are slick and durable. They don't look out of place sitting on a coffee table. 
What eles is there in America these days????? This magazine delivers on 2 of the 4. The others are freely available on HGTV and Food Network. But without the money, you can't hardly have 'em. An excellent and important mag 
Most magazimes half of their pages is advertizmet, this one have something to say and did make me some money when i used their top 10 stock picks for next year, that was January 99, the semiconductor boom, all 10 out of 10 
Put away some cash in mutual funds for retirement. Ideas on current investment thinking (even if it's often good to be contrarian and do the opposite of what they recommend) 
I purchased a value-package of this magazine and Kiplinger's, and I've been thrilled with both. About 20% of the articles and info are over my head, but the balance is understandable, helpful, and easily applied to my average money management skills. I've since ordered a SmartMoney subscription for three friends and relatives 
The Good -------- * This is a nice magazine for the price. * It has some informative articles, which maybe useful to newcomers to photography in general or the digital aspects of photography. * If you are getting started in photography, or you are at a beginner/amateur level, this magazine can be very helpful as a stepping stone * If you are an experienced amateur/pro, you can still like this magazine, but don't expect many in-depth/advanced topics. * The Monthly Lens reviews are helpful to SLR/DSLR users * For people who like to flip through magazines and even look at ads from different vendors, this is a good resource. The Not so good --------------- * The technical reviews of digital cameras are skin-deep compared to the in-depth technical reviews by the online photography sites (such as dpreview). * Sometimes the reviews are word-smithed in such a way that they avoid saying negative things, so -at times- you have to pick-up on what is not said in the review in order to figure out if there's something wrong with a product. * The "News" are 4-12 weeks behind real time. * If you expect in-depth or pro-level articles, those are rare. Consumer beware segment ----------------------- Towards the back of the magazine there are plenty of ads from various mail-order vendors. Some of them are very reputable, honorable and reliable vendors such as B and J However, some other vendors are less than stellar - to put it in mildly. You will recognize them by the too-good-to-be-true super-low prices, and they usually practice "bait switch" among other things. These have been documented on various websites and photography forums. If you are not familiar with all these, and you see prices that are very low, you may want to do some research before purchasing 
I subscribed to multiple photography magazines at first when I started getting serious about photography. I subscribed to 'Photography' and 'American Photo' and this one, Popular Photography and Imaging. Of the three this magazine has the most balanced amount of reviews, 'how tos', digital imaging related topics (Photoshop, etc) as well as some nice contests. Also they seem to sponsor more 'mentor series' type products where you can go to some locale and shoot photos for a reasonable fee. Of all the magazines this also had something that was important to me - half the magazine isn't ads. Photography was the worst offender of this, there'd be 50 or so pages of weak articles, and then 50 pages solid of ads. While this one does have a chunk of ads near the back, it still has a 'back page' article and articles mixed in among the ads. And only 25% of the magazine is advertisements. They also support a nice online website (popphoto.com) and have a forum where people can logon and ask questions. While not as heavily trafficked as say dpreview.com the authors and editors do read and respond to questions. Overall a great magazine for the hobby 
Popular Photography Imaging has a well-deserved reputation for being one of the best photography magazines available, yet it's not nearly as well-written or informative as it was prior to its merging with Modern Photography (If you are interested in checking this out, compare a current issue with one written back in the 1970's for example.). It remains useful for its product reviews, but these - especially of lenses - tend to be rather subjective, and not nearly as critical as a potential user might wish for. And worse yet for an avid amateur or professional photographer, the articles tend to be aimed towards novices, or at least are written as though they would be understood best only by novices. The only redeeming features are Herb Keppler's thoughtful insights on photography and occasional articles which are well written and edited. Otherwise, I would recommend taking a look at other photography magazines, most notably Shutterbug, which I have found to be more useful 
i heard of this magazine even before i came to this country and it never disappointed me ever since i subscribed it. i valued it most among other photography magazines i subscribed to. the reason is that i find this magazine have real stuff. for equipment, it has a detailed and objective test. the articles are not just obscure evaluation u find elsewhere, for instance, it once said:...based on our field and lab test, this amateur lens gives a better performance than its professional counterpart..., whereas in other magazines, what u find probably is this lens is good, and that one is nice.... for photo tips, it is more insightful than just sunny 16 or always use a tripod. u can find the photographer's own consideration as to why put the composition this way but not that. in all, i think this magazine is for anyone who is interested in photography to begin and continue wit 
I highly recommend Biblical Archaeology Review. My only regret is that I did not subscribe sooner. This is a must have magazine for the serious Biblical scholar 
I once asked the Regius Professor of Hebrew at the University of Cambridge how he stays abreast of fast-moving developments in biblical archaeology, a field of investigation that is related but decidely peripheral to his own work. 'I mostly read BAR ... ', he said, in an unexpectedly low-brow response for the hallowed halls of the Great University. 'Then if I want to know more about a topic, I move on to more scholarly publications.' It was a vote of confidence in a magazine (*not* an academic journal!) that I've read for years and found equally useful in maintaining a generalist knowledge in an area of investigation that - let's address the elephant in the room - most of us come to out of religious interests. BAR effectively combines the well-edited prose of leading scholars with due general-interest attention to color photos and complementary resources like slides (in a past era) and phenomenally well-produced videos and dvds. An issue pulled at random from my shelves (November/December 2001) contains articles entitled: -Excavating Philistine Gath. Have we found Goliath's hometown -The Monastery of the Cross. Where heaven and earth meet -The Rise and Fall of the Dead Sea -Is It or Isn't It - a Synagogue? In addition, the usual suspects appear issue by issue in interesting columns that add color commentary to a polemical field where personalities as well as artefacts and theories loom large. You'll want to ignore the over-heated reader responses on one brand of disillusionment or another. But you'd be wrong to heed some reviewers' critiques of the political headbashing that goes on among archaeologists. When elephants of this kind collide, it's usually over an ideological argument that matters. It does us no good to deride such battles as mere politics. BAR has had the good sense to play both a spectator's and a provocateur's role in such infighting over the complaints of readers who wish things were more placid around here. They are not. And the things we continue to dig up from the rocky ground of Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and other locations continue to insure that we never fall prey to boring consensus regarding the history of these great lands and the faiths they engendered. Read BAR if this sounds remotely interesting and decide for yourself 
The first issue was very interesting and look forward to the next one 
I've subscribed to BAR for at least 6 years now, and I enjoy the mix of articles on Holy Land archeology and related topics. The current events reported are informative and useful. The book reviews are helpful for guiding further reading in the field. I recommend it highly. My only complaint about the content would be that the editor tends to focus on controversies in the press and in the field that perhaps merit less attention than he gives it. Of course, it seems self-serving on his part to keep beating drums, but it is never dull. Probably sells a few extra copies evry month as well. A little background on myself: BA degree in anthropology, ordained elder in the Presbyterian Church, USA. I have worked in a public school for 20 years now. 
He's been in the rock business a long time, serving as chief editor/founder of BAR, Bible Review and Archaeology Odyssey; he is also president of Biblical Archaeology Society among many other ventures. I've read his Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls which he mainly edited, although he wrote a few articles himself. This is a magazine of substance, one I would love to have a subscription to. The issue of July/August 2004 has an interesting article/interview that Mr. Shanks orchestrated between Elie Wiesel and Frank Moore Cross, the subject being how they understood, approached, studied the Bible, from their perspective, which their lifes' work ultimately revolves around. One, F.M. Cross, comes from a Presbyterian, academic background, the other, Wiesel, a jewish one. Frank Moore Cross contributed several articles to Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls. He was the only protestant to work on the scrolls among the original team of 7 other people, six of whom were Catholic clerics; he is an expert in this field. And I just love Wiesel's mind, I love how he writes and thinks. That one article, I think is really illuminating, showing how rich in teaching the Bible is regardless of its many detractors, or fumbling misinterpreters. It is, as I've been taught in sunday school, G-d breathed, it's G-d's words, it is a living text even if it contains mostly stories of people long since dead and gone. Elie Wiesel says of it: " Wherever you open it, any page, you know that you are in the presence of something that exists nowhere else." The moral of the article is neither approach, Wiesel's or Cross', toward scripture is wrong, it just simply reflects the richness, the variety of the text 
BAR presents an overall terrific introduction to the world of Biblical artifacts! Professional archaeologists world-renowned scholars distill their dry, black-and-white academic publications into a language ordinary, non-technical people can understand put to use when they study the Bible. What I like in particular is their presentation of vivid color photos that bring the artifacts excavation sites to life! I appreciate BAR for introducing me to material I never knew existed that complements the Biblical record helps demonstrate its reliability (such as the mysterious LMLK seal impressions made during the lifetimes of King Hezekiah the great prophet Isaiah, which inspired me to write my own book on the subject--also available here at Amazon). My only complaint is that the editor occasionally publishes statements by archaeologists/scholars as facts when they actually represent atheistic/theistic biases in disguise. Fortunately, a Letters to the Editor section provides a forum for readers to challenge the experts, which makes for some interesting, often entertaining reading 
Since the early 80's I have been a fan of Cemetery Dance magazine. It comes every other month full of short stories by popular and up and coming horror authors. The magazine also contains great movie and book reviews, advertising, and author interviews. I encourage any horror fan to check out their website...the staff there is very friendly and helpful. On those hot summer days, it is a super mag to delve into and forget about the weather!!!! Enjo 
"Cemetary Dance" is a literary magazine devoted to the horror genre. It's not glossy, and except for the cover its pages are in black and white, but it is a good magazine nevertheless. Even though Amazon seems to think it is published 4 times a year, it is now published bi-monthly. So if interested in subscribing you'd better clarify that with them. Within its pages are original short stories by masters of horror such as King, Gorman, Little, Clegg, Straub, Lansdale, etc., as well as by lesser-known authors. There are also interviews, articles on all facets of the horror genre, and reviews of books, videos and software. There are ads for small horror presses and collectible editions. I recommend this as a must-read for horror fans 
What positives can one say about 'National Geographic' magazine that hasn't been said already. 'NG' is an American institution that appeals to individuals with a thirst for multi-culturalism, science, and sociology. And the photography is stunning to say the least. It is often said that 'the best education' is to travel far and wide and see how other cultures live and think. Since this isn't practical for many, the next best thing is to read 'National Geographic' magazine! In addition, the fairly recent cover article on 'Evolution' was well written, convincing, and accurate! And to the myopic, ignorant reviewer below who thinks that the world revolves around her, and who mentioned is not into Soccer, I say this to her: most of the world loves Soccer (technically called Football), and all the NFL, MLB, and NBA fans COMBINED don't even come close to the combined numbers of Soccer fans worldwide! I am a subscriber for life 
I've been a subscriber for over fifteen years, and will probably continue to subscribe until the day I die. But at times I find National Geographic frustrating. I have no interest in Soccer, nor do I want a huge fold-out map discussing the sport. Aren't there more phenomenal things going on in the world today? Also, Geographic does have its pet topics. How many articles must we read about Pandas? A dozen? I like pandas, believe me, but surely there are other less cute animals to discuss. Also I could do without lectures and PC environmental propaganda. The articles about oil-drilling in Alaska was filled with a thinly veiled agenda which was preachy and annoying. Yeah, we get it, you don't want Alaska drilled. Can we move on, please? Other articles are quite interesting. I enjoy the zip code discussion, the old-fashioned pictures, and articles about countries. I could do with fewer articles about underwater archaeology though, and the articles filled with preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring. A friend of mine (a Joe Average type guy), said he stopped subscribing to Geographic because the articles were depressing him. I tried to argue with him, because I think the magazine is great- but I do kind of have to agree, the topics of late are downbeat and aren't particularly uplifting. I do believe the magazine is getting a little 'out there' with its choice of topics, too. I recommend this magazine for those interested in the environment and the world around them 
National Geographic Magazine is written primarily for theperson with little or no background in Geography. It is not an intense scholarly magazine and , as a Geograohy professor pointed out, tends to be chatty. But, it does give great information on geopgraphy as well as other fields in the Social Sciences even Natural History. There are many articles about people and places around the world and their customs. There are articles on the latest explorations and discoveries. Such as the rediscovery of the Gnostic Gospel of Judas and the oldest tatooed mummy.Zip USA takes a single US Zip Code and describes the customs and practices of the people living within that zip code. There are many interesting articles about people and places in the United States. I became interested in Geography and Anthropology through reading this magazine. The articles are quite informative and entertaining and the photography is outstanding 
I've learned so much from this magazine. It takes you into cultures from all over the world and teaches you about them. Every month you're looking at pictures of events and people sometimes in places that you have never even heard of. Really educational and top notch 
I have always had a copy of National Geographic available to me. As a kid I glanced at my Dad's copy (just for the pictures- I had a subscription to Ranger Rick that was more my style until I was 8). As an adult I read it cover to cover every month and its the first magazine I look for on the newsstands. Simple the best magazine that is published 
Since I was a young girl I have poured over National Geographic photographs and some things never change. The stories now captivate me more as an adult and I appreciate that I have learned a lot about the world through the pages of this magazine that I might not ever had the opportunity about different cultures, places and events. After reading an article I sometimes have the feeling that I have been there. The articles are longer than most magazines, but I welcome the time I take to read an entire article from beginning to end (something that was more difficult when my daughter was younger) The inserts are an added bonus my favorite being the composite map of the world at night showing city lights and fires and such across the globe. Would I want to live with out National Geographic, no way 
Esquire is a very good magazine with a talented staff of excellent writers and photographers. The magazine is designed to appeal to the more upscale, more highly educated man. Articles cover a wide range of topics, from fashion, to politics, to health, to food drink, to sports, to travel, to sex. Most of the articles are short, but you can count on finding a few lengthy pieces of journalism, and typically at least one interview with a well- known public figure.Esquire is printed on quality paper and with quality binding (no staples), and it has a very professional look to it. I enjoy the articles in Esquire. The writers are very good, with several of them using humor as the main ingredient of their journalism. Others are more serious. The writers provide a good level of balance and with so many different topics (cars, food, drink, politics, etc.) available in each issue to read, you can skip over those that are less appealing and concentrate on the ones that suit your interests 
Still maintains an excellent reputation as a top men's life style magazine. Articles are certainly for the more enlightened reader. But still manages to provide a good balance of light-heqarted fare. A must subscribe for the 'modern man' 
If you're like me - middle-aged, white, male, conservative, Christian, who buys most of my clothes at Old Navy - you will be the target of all the condescending ridicule in every article. And yet I find it very entertaining! Although I'll never be able to afford even one of their recommended outfits, and I'm usually a full 180 degrees opposite of their political views, I find their articles interesting, well-written, and insightful. I must admit, I should hate Esquire, because the editors and writers would find me disgusting. But somehow I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox every month. The writers, if nothing else, are intelligent, which is more than I can say for the writers in most guy magazines like FHM and Maxim 
Magazine was fast to ship,filled with great advice on fashion,style and all of life's wisdom and wit all in one magazine 
This is the original. If you are looking for a man's magazine that is insightful, thought provoking, entertaining, and a great buy, look no further. Esquire has been around a long time and one of the reasons for its great success is that it has a certain 'feel' to it that transcends time. Yet it is right on the cutting edge of today's issues. Magazines like Maxim, Stuff, and FHM will never be in the class of Esquire because their appeal is strictly 'shock-value.' Basically if you have seen one of them, you've seen them all. They offer nothing new, and most of the content is pretty crass. Esquire, on the other hand entertains while making you think about a wide range of issues. There is always something in Esquire that makes you want to pick it up and actually read what's between the covers. Yet it still has its own unique style. The subscription price is huge bargain. You can't go wrong with it 
First off the best part of this magazine by far is the advertisements for those trips of a lifetime. The trips around the Mediterranean, the Pyramids etc always leave me daydreaming.... Ok maybe I'm exaggerating about the "best" part but when the ads are this good rest of the magazine has to be great! My photographer wife loves the Smithsonian as well and the photography awards a few issues back were STUNNING. Most winners of other photography contests in photography magazines always make you wander what the judges were smoking. You'll find something of interest in ever issue from astronomy to archeology along with beautiful photography. Plus the classifieds are full of ads for really cool items. But I already said that already. :)  
I have always loved this magazine and I am so glad I have it at home now 
Small pieces on the entire world - past present and future. Yum 
I've been getting this magazine through Smithsonian for several years, so was delighted to see that I could get it cheaper through Amazon. (Smithsonian reminds me of Nat'l Geographic, which I also love.) My complaint in getting through Amazon, though, is that I could not stipulate when I wanted the subscription to start. My previous subscription just ended, so I do hope that it starts soon 
I have been an avid reader and supporter of Smithsonian magazine since I received my gift subscription in the early 70's. This is a cover to cover read every month and the museums are not to be missed if you have the opportunity to visit. They have rich collections for every interest, young and old 
Smithsonian is the magazine where I read about issues that wind up being newsmakers later. Really esoteric stuff. It's not flashy, or a quick read, or filled with funny, snarky content, so it sometimes is the last one I pick up (of my subscriptions)--it takes a little time and a quiet moment in the day. That said: this magazine has so much to recommend it. I really feel like I learn something each month when I read it. There is a good range of subjects in each issue--everything from articles on the environment to exploration to history to science. And then some. It really will educate you. If you care to be informed and continue learning, then I recommend Smithsonian. I also think it has gotten a little more interesting in the last five or so years. I would hate to have to live without Smithsonian, National Geographic, The New Yorker and The Atlantic. 
French Vogue is a magazine which is published in french and is directed towards the people of France, and anyone else who is interested in the tops in fashion, art, books, movies, as well as health, beauty, and fitness issues. Vogue is for the person who is either "In", who who wants to be. It is often heavy laden with photos and articles on celebrities, and contains the usual array of advertisements directed at the Jetset. Vogue, especially the french, italian, and german versions are very highly collectible. And you don't have to keep them a thousand years for them to be worth any money. Many Vogue's have come right off the press and became immediate collectibles. So this is another reason to have a subscription to this fine publication. I own a subscription to Vogue, and I WILL renew my subscription, not only because it is a collectible, but I truly love the almost artistic photography, and the intriguing articles each issue brings. If you want a magazine that brings you the best the world has to offer, if you desire a magazine that not only makes you look forward to getting it every month, but also could be a decent investment for the future, you'll want to subscribe to this publication. 
I don't speak a word of french,and I barely read it, but I love this magazine!!! If you love fashion, get a french dictionary,I did, this is a magazine to savor! I have every issue since Ms. Roitfeld took over and will keep them forever! This magazine is very sexy, modern, french, well edited, up to the minute, bold, well designed(Fabian Baron) intelligent, I could go on and on, I've seen/get all the rest, including Vogue Italia, this edition has all the best stylists, photogs, and editors, I can't wait for the next issue! 
I don't know how to get in touch with the Magazine Express Inc. people, but I'd have a serious lecture for them about poor delivery. I always get my magazine about a month late (yes after it's been on newstands for that long) and that's IF I recieve it at all. If you move during the middle of your subscription, you're screwed. It took months to get them to forward them correctly to my new address and in the meantime, the few I missed were just lost. When you're paying upwards of $100 for a subscription and only get 10 a year (French Vogue only produces 10 issues), but 3 are lost in the mail, you lose 30 percent or your money. Bum deal 
I like the magazing because it fits my lifestyle. It keeps it real with the in your face articles. The fluff is perfect for this style of magazine and i look forward to every issue for the new product info alone. The kick a$$ ladies don't hurt either.I have subscriptions to Stuff,FHM,and Maxim until 2010 and to me worth every penny 
A magazine filled with hot women, movie reviews, game reviews, and nonsense that is sure to make you laugh out loud because of its stupidity. 
How anyone can dismiss this magazine is beyond me. It's the best. Lessons learned? Chicks like Dudes with money! Check! Chicks are totally into sex 24/7! Check! The New Star Wars Movie is gonna Rock! Check 
I have been reading and glancing at your magazine for probly about 4 years now and all I can say is you just keep getting bigger &amp; better with every issue. Thanx for getting it started and continue your success. I love it. And Please Keep putting those Beautiful Babes in every issue too 
I have been reading this magazine for years. I love the tips and enjoy looking at what is "fashionable" at the time. I recommend this magazine! 
I tend to buy a lot of fashion and beauty magazines, and immensely enjoy reading them when I have time to relax and forget about my intense and demanding job. I do believe that InStyle is the best one, for me anyway. My favorite feature is the "Great at Any Age" where they discuss a clothing or beauty option and they present how it can look best on women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. I don't know of ANY other magazine that does that so well. I just canceled my Lucky subscription because I was so tired of seeing ONLY clothes that look great on 20 year olds. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against 20s, but a magazine needs to show a RANGE to be useful. InStyle magazine covers fashion and beauty very well, and is full of great tips and information for *everyone. 
In my humble opinion, this is the best magazine for style and fashion advice. Even the advertisements are hip and informative, in terms of fashion and style. Of all the style magazines out there today, this is far and away the best of the best. 
InStyle is my favorite fashion magazine out there. It is much more reader-friendly than Vogue - much cleaner layout, the font is easier to read, and the writing is clear, witty, and less dry. I've been reading InStyle for about 3 years, and each issue never disappoints me. The focus of the magazine is definitely fashion, but there are also makeup tips and celebrity news. The magazine targets a much broader audience than more haute couture magazines like Vogue. My favorite section is "The Look" which highlights celebrity fashion and also has a section at the end that profiles a specific designer or label. InStyle also features many tips and recommendations on beauty products. The best issue of the year is without a doubt in March or April when they do "Best Beauty Buys." After polling beauty experts and testing hundreds of products, they feature the best beauty products in ever imaginable category. I've discovered some of my favorite beauty products through these issues, and it's nice to be able to trust a source without wasting your money on testing out expensive products that don't work for you. It is the best source for getting the most reliable products out there, from hair care products to makeup. I have seen several women at Sephora, clutching torn out pages from InStyle's Best Beauty Buys and frantically searching for the right mascara. I understand that Vogue is an institution now, but InStyle offers a much better alternative, and provides articles that you actually want to read and tips you actually use. 
I love InStyle. I can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of InStyle. It is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic, timeless fashion. It shows what is hot, how to put outfits together, who wears what, and it doesn't try to dabble in other areas. It sticks to fashion and I like that. That is why I subscribe to it and probably always will. The best out there. MUCH better than Elle and likely even better than Vogue. I love it 
I'm a bit of a magazine junkie and subscribe to about 15 different magazines (and slowly reviewing them all). In Style is DEFINITELY my favorite FASHION magazine. It doesn't give advice on how to pleasure your man but they do have a few fun articles on celebrities and fashion-related news. The styles they show are so versatile and easy to assemble yourself in real life. In Style offers alternatives to super expensive clothing by categoring some pieces in $, $$, and $$$. I love it because I can afford 80% of the fashion they show, whereas Elle, Vogue, and W are all a little bit "over" my taste. To me, In Style is more affordable and easier to relate to on an everyday basis. If you do enjoy high fashion and $1000 purses, you should probably look elsewhere. In Style offers a healthy dose of celebrity fashion that I need every month, and I really, do do do love this magazine 
one of the most erudite music magazines on the market! several in depth articles in each issue. extensive reviews that don't fudge - candid and critical, and lots of pings to bands you've heard before, when reviewing those it's likely you haven't. the only criticism i can think of, is that it's become so big and thick with ads that it's gotten harder to get thru! but many of the ads display great graphic design, even they are fun 
I discovered this "magazine" while employed as the Reference and Instructional Librarian at a Culinary College. The four annual HARDCOVER issues arrive with just one ad - the back cover. The recipe quantities are typically for a family size rather than the mass serving quantities. This is important to note because this magazine IS very much oriented towards the professional or the very advanced amateur chef. Profiles and articles tend to focus on the needs of the Professional. One patron (a local sous chef who had graduated from a different culinary school some years earlier) began swearing a blue streak after thumbing through a few issues. When I confronted him about the outburst, he apologized and explained his behavior. For three years, he had worked under a local chef and been amazed at the creativity of the chef in coming up with new recipes for the restaurant. After thumbing through the issues, my patron had realized an ugly truth - their entire menu was being cribbed from Art Culinaire. When I told him I had at my disposal a large stack of subscription forms, he immediately took one saying, "Next time, I'll be ahead of him." Each issue is large enough and beautiful enough to double as a coffee table book (the paper quality and pictures are easily superior to most cookbooks), but you will want to keep every sauce-splattered issue as close to the stove as you can with burning the pages. There is no other magazine to compare it to and very few cookbooks that can match it 
Art Culinaire is probably one of the absolute BEST magazines available to the culinary industry. Currently, I'm a culinary student and I have thoroughly enjoyed looking through each copy of Art Culinaire as my school has received it. Granted, the price is a bit steep when you're only getting four issues, but when those issues are bound like a book... They'll last far, far longer than any other magazine, no matter how careful you are with the others. Myself, I'm looking forward to having some cash free so I can get a subscription 
This is an outstanding publication. Unlike most magazines and books, this is the real deal with full recipes from leading chefs. I simply do not understand why it is so hard to find. These recipes are complicated, but if you like to cook, you'll find this inspirational. Everything is well photographed. It doesn't get any better than this 
What a tough job these guys have -- searching the globe for only Perfect 10's! The girls are gorgeous, and the pictures are fantastic. They're not usually sexy shots, though. They're glamour shots 
well the articles are much better then they are in Maxim. These people have some sophistication. The women are a lot of naked and that is great plus they are increddibly hot. Most of them are from Europe which is awesome any way. I really don't know why I gave it 4 stars because nothing holds it from a 5 sta 
This magazine is GREAT. It covers the things you may know in history, but also tells the 'whole story'. The stories cover from 1492 to Post WWII. This magazine is the only one I have found that tells the full whole history in a easy to read interesting format. I would reccomend it for all Americans who want to know the true interesting history of America and not the shallow 3 minute news driven or HollyWood slanted history 
The right audience is the grunt in the trenches of today's commercial coding. You've got to deal all the weirdness of Java, C++, a dozen different web technologies all calling themselves THE technology, and lots more. This magazine gives you plenty of ammunition for those tactical assaults on performance, STL, exception handling, networking, and all the other foes you face daily, with plenty of source samples. This is not for anyone looking beyond today's technologies, to the next one or the one after. It's not for someone newly bumped up to project lead, who is barely dog-paddling in the deep end of planning, scheduling, and strategy. It's not for readers who want industry news much beyond the Wintel world, or the details needed to create the most complex systems instead of simply using them. These readers may find bits of help, but they're not the patients that Dr. Dobbs intends to treat. Pick it up at your news-stand and thumb through a few issues. You'll know in a hurry whether this addresses your interests. If it does, it can give you real boost as an implementor. It's not for all readers, though. //wiredweir 
If you are a guy that loves some sexy women of your dreams, COP THIS MAGAZINE. You might even want to get a 2 year subscription. This magazine is full of of sex full figured queens and you can almost bet that the cover girl will always make your heart beat faster and make your mouth water. LONG LIVE THE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I love this magazine(not because of the big ole booty's), because of the way they present the ladies. I have never seen a cover of King showing some skinny, no meat eating, starving her self to death type chic! They show real women, with real shapes. It shows how women look in the real world! I love it, and yeah I must admit, I do love the big ole booty's!! Sorry Ladies, I am a man! LoL 
I love King magazine! With that said the only thing I would change is the ratio of beautiful ladies to Rim advertisements. You have to flip through several pages of bling before getting to the "meat" of the magazine and the reason I bought it in the first place. I do have to say that I am impressed with how they make it a true mens magazine for people with "exotic" tastes and not a generic magazine with hot girls. BUY IT! 
I'M GLAD THEY FINALLY CAME OUT WITH A MAGAZINE LIKE THIS SO PEOPLE CAN QUIT COMPLAINING. NOW EVERYONE CAN BE HAPPY.... MAGAZINES FOR GUYS THAT LIKE THIN GIRLS, MAGAZINES FOR GUYS THAT LIKE THICK GIRLS. CAN WE ALL GET ALONG NOW? 
Listen up gents. If your sick and tired of having to put up with what white Hollywood and the queer white fashionistas try to pass off as sexy in "Maxim" or "FHM" and all that bulls--t, then you need to peep "King" where you get to see F.I.N.E. fine sistas like Gabrielle Union, Trina, Syleena Johnson. This magazine is out there for the BROTHAHS!! No flatbacks, no Barbies dipped in chocolate. All BLACK WOMAN! CHECK THIS OUT !! 
King, the ultimate mens mag. You name it, it has it in it. It's not just about the beautiful women, the stories, the articles, music, movie and games and i did mention the women right? If there is one magazine that should be on a man's coffee table, this one should be right next to the remote 
Hey this magazine is geared to the black man but I love it for the hot curvy bootylicious black models and celebrity guest pictorials. Where else are you going to see Gabrielle Union showing all that sweet chocolate goodness? It ain't going to be in Maxim or Stuff. Those two magazines seem to think there are only two black women on the planet... Thandie Newton (a white girl dipped in caramel) and --of course-- the ubiquitous Halle Berry. But this mag has way too many ads 
This is my favorite maganzine. I like the women in it. They look good. Finally good looking girls. Get a subscription 
This magazine is very accessible when in comes to current music news and also offers alot of others sections as well that are equal interesting. It informs you about upcoming artists as well as established acts. 
For the price Vibe is okay, but it lost it's sizzle somewhere during the last five years. I look forward to Vibe Vixen, perhaps it will stir up my interests again. True, there are a lot of ads now, but the articles are interesting. What I miss about the magazine is that it seems like they never "break" any news anymore. Perhaps it's the Internet's fault, but I remember a time when the details of an artists Vibe interview really created a buzz (like in 99 when Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes balked to Vibe her personal feelings about the "Fan Mail" album), but now everything is just pretty mediorcre with this magazine. It's also totally predictable. When someone they consider "hot" has a product coming out you know they will be on the cover, and when I saw Pharrell and Gwen Stefani on the cover I thought that was a bit of a stretch. It's still a good magazine but I find I enjoy Blender and Sister 2 Sister much better, but for the price I will continue to support this magazine 
I'd been a long-time fan to VIBE since they been out. I 'member I first lay eyes on em by checking the covers on 'em but not reading by 'em. y'know. They such knockouts. Yeah they definitely keepin' it real no matter what. I believe they'll be around more and more since them magazines u read all the time like ESSENCE, EBONY and JET. I still have love for them also. But to say VIBE doesn't suck. I'd never been a subscriber since last year and I definitely enjoy it to this day. I actually read the XXL and Source magazine most often now. Same w/ Upscale, Campus Life, just to name others. I luv they magazine to death man, knahmsayin. Ya'll keep it rocked y'heard. Nobody's bringin' the hype on ya fellaz. Keep it UP!! 
man i love this but some of the items are to high and my wife dont like dat so please lower dem or i will sue u alright 
I've been a subscriber for the past 2 years and since then I've stopped reading The Source almost completly. I can't believe I wasted my money like that. This magazine is everything.. you get the latest 411 on da lastest fashion, issues affecting our communites, close up, personal interviews with the top names in Hip Hop and the column in the back where they discuss the unusual things going on in question 
If you're into dope culture or just a straight up toker, you gotta check out the times...a must have for the intelligent burn lover. Bud picks, Price index for USA Canada, News, Dope Politics, Grow Tips, everything the daily puffer needs to know...you gotta love this...if u chokin'...i'de advise you 2 pick this u 
this magazine is sweet it features tons of eye candy, being plants and hot girls and buds, lots of great tips, tricks and info on the culture around pot 
You may get a Subscription for $19.99 if you pull out a loose insert from one of the magazines on the shelf at the books store or super market 
This magazine would be a delightful reading experience for a wide audience. It appeals the *most* to busy young adults, who are looking for quick, healthy, easy-to-make delicious meals, which they just *might* want to spice up with an occasional adventurous new taste in wine recommendations. There is a wonderful column on "new flavors". In the June 2004 issue it is "lemongrass". In the July issue it is "miso". There are fine recommendations for new restaurants in exotic locales, such as, Bermuda or Sao Paolo, Brazil. Also included are foods for special holidays, such as in June for "Father's day". Naturally, grilling is the "haute cuisine" on this auspicious day. The recipes for "Salmon Nicoise Sandwiches" and "Tuscan Baby Back Ribs" are mouth-watering ... The "fast food" section is loaded with tasty healthful salads, such as, "Spicy Chicken, Avacado, and Mango Salad" and "Turkey and Green Bean Stir-Fry with Peanuts". Some grilling suggestions include, "Tandoori Pork with Gingered Mango Salad" and "Korean-Style Chicken Wraps". Needless to say, all the food is tempting and the recipes are not too difficult to accomplish, provided one is already familiar with cooking techniques. Overall, the emphasis on this magazine is *not* on wine but instead on food. For a change of pace, the June issue has a very fine article on "vodka". In the July 2004 issue there is a superb article by Robert Parker called, "Australian Wine Guide". The regular wine column covers "German Reisling" by Richard Nailey. Most impressively, the July issue introduces the reader to "America's Best New Chefs of 2004". Of course, each selects a recipe to share. This magazine is loaded with unique articles for the adventurous cook and aspiring gourmand. Highly recommended. Erika Borsos (erikab93 
This is an excellent nature magazine. It is exactly what it looks like - a magazine about the world and the animals in it. There is an ongoing hunt for the little bird and other little animal that are hidden in the magazine each month. It is a fun magazine with drawings by children, cute pictures and posters, stories, information and more. A great subscription for the prereading crowd. 
One thing I like about it is the little books inside that you get to put together. I like the comics and the animal stories and the games and the pictures of animals and a poster inside. There are also song tracks with different kinds of pictures instead of words. It's real fun to read! The games are awesome! Also you can send pictures of yourself or that you draw to the magazine 
I purchased National Geographic Kids, Your Big Bad Yard, Animal Baby and Ranger Rick for a family of four children. They fight over each issue and now want renewals. How much better is this than a $20 toy for them, their parents and me? How does it feel to have a child remind me in July that he loves his Christmas gift? Immeasurable. There is no down side 
My 4ish daughter LOVES this magazine, as do we. Each issue gets pretty tattered while she waits for the next issue. Educational (for all of us) and entertaining. She remembers the information given to her in the short and concise articles and enjoys testing us to see if we were paying attention. A keeper for sure 
We've been receiving Your Big Backyard for a couple of years now and my daughter really looks forward to receiving it each month. The stories are alot of fun to read and it really encourages us to learn and talk about animals that we wouldn't if we did not receive the magazine. After we read it my daughter enjoys making collages from her favorite pictures. I highly recommend it 
This is a great magazine for preschool/early elementary kids. We have renewed it twice and enjoy watching our son learn more with each issue. The editors do a great job of publishing intersting and unique facts about many different kids of animals 
I rarely write reviews but couldn't believe what I read by the other reviewers, most of whom focused on how ritzy the lifestyles of the parents depicted in the articles are, how "expensive" the clothes are, how pretty the moms (models) are, etc...This is a magazine. Don't we expect some kind of facade? Other "Parenting" magazines may APPEAR to be more about and for "real" parents, but this is no more than their chosen tactic. As with any publication whose foundational goal is to sell more advertising, they wouldn't be doing this unless they believed it was going to work. They are selling a certain "lifestyle" just like CHILD magazine is. If it's more in accordance with yours, fine. But why trash another just because it's different? CHILD Magazine isn't perfect. But at least it doesn't pander. Does anyone really want to see what Target's latest attempt at toddler fashion is when they open a magazine? I'd rather just check for myself the next time I'm out buying diapers. If you value solid writing above all else in a magazine, then CHILD Magazine is for you. (And whether you can afford that $90 pair of toddler shorts on page 28 won't be such an issue.) 
I like this magazine for a lot of reasons, but my admiration is primarily for their willingness to provide solid, thoughtful reporting without pandering to the lowest-common-denomiator reader. This is not to say it's a high-brow publication--it's not. Rather, Child carefully avoids publishing the type of mindless pap that so many parenting publications pack into every issue (i.e., "25 Ways to Tie your Shoes!" or "Picnics with Peanut Butter!" or "What Your Child's Doctor Won't Tell You About Lice!"). Child is a well written, well designed magazine that is readable, informative and, frankly, cheap. I can't ask for more than that 
If you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis, Forbes and Fortune are the two conventional choices. I started reading Fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when I realized that the business people with whom I associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages. It fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits. Fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends. You won't find anything radical here, but you need to have read it if this kind of news, analysis, and opinion fits your job description or personal interests. There is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson' in each edition. For me, the highlight is Stanley Bing's delicious, irreverent, and every so slightly jaded backpage column. I routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at Bing's corporate lunacy as I do. Fortune is behind the eponymous Fortune 500 and other derivative lists. For me, one of the most valuable is the magazine's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue', though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests. Other readers will tear out or access other Fortune lists online with equal interest. If you're in business or work with people who are, you'd better be reading Fortune or Forbes or both 
"Fortune" is a classic on the newsstand, and is as vital and important today as ever. "Fortune" generally caters to people with a managerial bent, especially upper-level executives, but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world, the global and national economic climate, and forward-looking technology and trend information. Each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story, like the Enron trial, or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year. I do enjoy the articles where they rank things, but more than the rankings themselves, I am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings; while I don't always agree with the magazine, I do always find it good food for thought. The features are generally very polished and accurate, and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a CEO as to a college business student. I particularly appreciate the interviews that "Fortune" has with key players in the financial industry, and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue. The magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like "Kiplinger's." Nonetheless, the investment advice and insight "Fortune" offers should generally be held in high esteem. I also appreciate the coverage of key trends, and in particular want to note that "Fortune" has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in America: coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader. Many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money; while there are several I would recommend, "Fortune" remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends, and should be a part of everyone's business library 
Good magazine. if you like video games, this is an unbiased, very informative magazine with great reviews 
Talk about a hella sweeet magazine! I love this magazine, and have been subscribing since I was a little kid of 35 years of age. Bangin' reviews, bangin' cover stories. I like it tons more than other competition, such as GamePro. I highly recommend it! In a way, this magazine actually reminds me a lot of GamePro. The formatting is almost the same. But the article writing is 10 times better than anything out of GamePro, over the last 2 or 3 years. I can't quite put my finger on what differentiates EGM from GamePro, but its noticeable, and much more refreshing than GamePro. Sorry to compare it so much, but they are virtually the same, but EGM is better. It just is. MC White said: Check it out 
I've had a subscription to this magazine for three years and gave never had a problem with the magazine. I love this magazine, it gives good reviews of games with objective point of views. The editorials and articles are humorous and factual. 
Many gaming magazines suffer from spam.Each page is littered with junky ads.Although EGM doesn't have the constant spam,or atleast as bad as some magazines.EGM is possibly the most informative gaming magazine available.Very affordable for a 12 month plan.Some issues have cool stickers or posters and little nice additions.The magazine isn't nerdafied where a non-gamer could pick it up and comprehend it for the most part.Whats nice about EGM is the rating done to each game.Some games that are hyped automatically get good ratings EGM doesn't let the hype get to them they treat it like any other game. The fan art is colorful the screenshots for each game gives you a good idea what to expect from each game.They have little Q areas and issues answered about some games and junk.Upcomming titles are previewed and glorified,so you can almost see the future of gaming.The get the hands on for some upcomming title and even give you the heads up.The reviewers seem in their right groove and not lacking a one sided touch. The price is nice each issue is packed with information,every thing down to the last page is gamer worthy.Buy atleast one issue to help you determin if you like it or not before making a such a commitment 
I am a big fan of British publications such as the Economist and Financial Times because they tend to offer a more balanced and global perspective of the news. The articles here are short and sweet. That is why I was so suprised at how thin the newspaper was when I got my first delivery. This can be a good thing when you are busy, but sometimes I found myself wanting more in-depth coverage. This is where the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) tends to shine. Plus, WSJ has more articles addressing one's lifestyle, i.e, the Personal Journal. Also, the op-ed pieces are undeniably left-leaning but a bit more balanced whereas WSJ tends to be pretty conservative and one-sided. Although I really enjoyed the newspaper, I cancelled my subscription because of the horrible delivery service. One final note, be prepared for the salmon pink color of the newspaper. I know they want to stand apart from other publications, but it makes the newspaper look like it's been stuck in an attic for 10 years and makes it kind of hard to read in low light settings. 
With its over 150 years of experience, the Financial Times is one of the greatest newspapers in the world. Recently rated as the most reliable news source by a survey of journalists, politicians, and other authorities, there are few newspapers that can match its breadth of coverage or depth of analysis. Although it is much lighter than the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, what it does contain is worth its weight in gold. Besides, who can remember everything in the newspaper anyway? Although I would give five stars for this great paper, I have to give four stars because delivery in my area is very bad! Today, I got the Friday edition, when I should be getting the Weekend edition! Getting a newspaper a day late isn't very good, although perhaps it's more the fault of the USPS than the FT 
When I considered subscribing to FT last year, I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't any recent reviews on it. So here we go... I subscribe to both the Wall St Journal and Financial Times (FT), and have in the past subscribed to The Economist. For comparison's sake, the WSJ is very good in its section one coverage, especially front page stories, political coverage, and its excellent and frequently quoted editorials. For me, the other stuff is fluff. Regarding the Economist, it is a highly touted weekly newsmagazine with two downfalls (and reasons why I cancelled my subscription) - it is weekly (!) and seems to interject alot of commentary into its stories. Which leads us to the FT. With FT, I feel like I'm reading THE NEWS, and more importantly, it is in a daily format, ensuring you'll be up to date on the latest global news. There is excellent coverage of US happenings, along with Europe and Asia. Once you read it, you feel much better informed - where else can you get daily extended coverage of the Russian/Ukraine natural gas issue or, from several months ago, daily coverage of Germany's elections? Along with excellent reporting comes great, although somewhat left/liberal commentary - don't let that dissuade you, however. Other gems include business reporting, including stories on management ideas, business life, etc.... and the most excellent Weekend edition (Saturday), full of all sorts of cultural stories, including food, wine, arts, book reviews, travel, and the like. Not too mention awesome columns by Lucy Kellaway, Martin Lukes, and Tyler Brule. You must pick this up and indulge yourself for a few weeks, if you are undecided. You will not be disappointed. Reading and owning the FT is a must. 
This newspaper provides an outside-the-box (US) opinion, even though Britain's outlook is similarities to ours. I read the WSJ daily and the NYTimes when I can, but the WSJ is so conservative and the NYTimes is so liberal that this provides a source that is at least one level removed from the conservative/liberal bias in this country 
Recently my family was visiting a relative in the hospital. I spotted the 60th anniversary issue of Highlights for Children. In perusing it I noted how the magazine's style and format had evolved over the years. In showing the magazine to my [...] year old daughter, I realized that Higlights appeal to children had not waned since I was a kid. My daughter simply adored it. She especially liked the riddles. She has asked us to get a subscription, which we will gladly oblige her with come Christmas. 
I read Highlight Magazine faithfully when I was a child. Now I am a mother of two (2nd grade and Kind.). I just got a tip from a teacher at school - the writers of the Highlight (Harcourt) also write the exam for the 3rd grade state test in New York state. 
I enjoyed this magazine as a kid, but then, I also loved Electric Company. Looking at both now, they seem dated and tedious, but perhaps our children need something that moves at a slower pace than everything seems to do now. Neither of my children (5 7) enjoyed Highlights at first, but after getting a subscription from their grandmother, they have discovered the joy of curling up in a quiet corner and figuring out the puzzles and stories for themselves. It's a magazine with a style and format that encourages reflection and absorption, rather than a voracious grab and go version of reading, that I believe will give a child a better foundation. "To read without reflection is like eating without digesting" Edmund Burk 
My kids love Highlights! It's applicable to both of their age ranges (6 and 9) and is a valuable investment for any parent. I don't know what I would do without this magazine; it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car. Not to mention, it's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months. 
Highlights magazine is the New Yorker of children's literature. Following that analogy, the Nickelodean Magazine or Disney Princess might be the In Touch Weekly's of children's lit. Highlights may at times feel outdated and stale (as might the New Yorker), but overall the quality is consistent and there is plenty to enjoy. The Hidden Picture puzzle alone is worth the price. If you only know the magazine from schools and doctor's waiting rooms from your childhood, you might not have had the chance to see a pristine Hidden Picture puzzle. The pictures end up getting marked up by kids with poor impulse control and listless parents, the future sociopaths of America, who evidently did not absorb any lessons first from Goofus and Gallant. With Highlights you get no advertising, no slick pandering your children, and you get stories, puzzles, projects, poems, and those lovable Timbertoes. It's also good just to get magazines for kids in the mail. I find it to be a nice way to encourage reading in my family. Nothing cuter than going through the mail with the kids after which everyone sits down together, in earnest, and flips through their magazine. 
I have subscribed to both Alfred Hitchcock and Ellery Queen for years. EQMM is usually a notch better in quality, but AHMM is the avenue for new writers to use more often. As such, the quality of writing is more erratic, but the stories are often more adventurous and the voice a little fresher. Not only that, but AHMM has a monthly contest which is fun and challenging for writers at any level, and a monthly logic puzzle which is always entertaining 
Though mystery novels have never been more popular, we seem to have forgotten the pleasures of the short story. Every month, AHMM offers a satisfying range of stories from noirs to cozies, from contemporaries to historicals, by both established writers and newcomers. This is a great place to spot talent on the way up or to sample the work of writers you don't know (without committing to a novel). Plus, short stories are perfect for the bus or the subway. Once, a wide range of magazines published short fiction in a variety of genres; AHMM is one of the few still upholding that proud tradition 
LONG TIME LOYAL COSMOPOLITAN READER RATES 5 STARS I've read COSMOPOLITAN and HELEN GURLEY BROWN since the 60's and never miss a month. Along with skads of other magazines I enjoy, Cosmopolitan manages to have some fun fashion, fun hip dating articles, fiction and true stories, and lots of quick reading ideas. I've never thought of it as a "health" magazine as another reviewer thought of..it's been an iconic reading for the EARLY SEX in the CITY set. "Sex and the Single Girl" by Helen Gurley Brown was a breakthough book in its day, letting women in the 60's know that it's perfectly okay to chose career and other paths in life than the one society forced on the women in that day. Cosmopolitan has been the singles bible that confirms that it is okay to be single and thriving and adventurous in your life. I can see where this would irk men that want to REPRESS women, or WOMEN that have subdued to their REPRESSION, but if that's not you...then keep the COSMOPLITAN's coming. Catch up on some great women and what they're doing. Educate yourself on women's health issues, Find out what men like...a few tricks..check out the fashion, new make up tricks, and new products, and never stop learning. Personally, I plan to read it forever. There's something for everyone in it. And it has inspired me for decades. Thank you, Cosmopolitan 
THIS IS THE MOST AUTHENTIC METAL MAG IN PRINT! NO MUDVAYNE HERE SO FAKERS BEWARE. HAVING BEEN AN EXCESSIVE METAL FAN FOR DECADES NOW, I CAN CREDIT THIS MAGAZINE WITH INTRODUCING ME TO MORE NEW BANDS THAN ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE. nOW WHO ELSE WOULD DO AN INTERVIEW WITH BURZUM, MAIDEN, CARCASS, AUTOPSY AND BLOODBATH IN THE SAME ISSUE ALONGSIDE A SABBATH, DIO, OR EMPEROR PIECE. MM THAT'S WHO. BUY IT OR PISS OFF. HAILS AND HORNS UP TO LIZ CIAVARELLA AND CO 
allright excetp wait and it to start and then get 3 monthly magazines in a wee 
Stories better then nudity Most of the magazines out there are all about nudity. This one is great because it is more about the stimulations of the mind. 
Yeah baby, I am sure that all the letters are in fact absolutely true. I mean who doesn't want to see their wife get laid by 10 large black guys every night? I know that's why I got married 
Penthouse has always been better than playboy when it comes to erotic pictures and stories. This magazine is always full of entertaining stories and letters from readers that are supposed to be fact based exploits,maybe 50/50 in reality. The pictures are very explicit and erotic. Great entertainment for adults only 
I think I have read at least one issue of almost every parenting, family, children, activity, teacher magazine there is... This one is by far the best I've read in a while! From my perspective - a parent of a preemie and an early childhood teacher - it shows childhood to parents in terms/emotions/images they can understand and relate to while conveying what an early childhood teacher/developmentalist/interventionist knows to be true. Way to go Disney! I'm impressed 
I have always avoided parenting magazines: with their crowded covers of life-or-death information, flash-in-the-pan expert pontificating (pacifiers are dangerous! not using pacifiers is dangerous!), buzz-word-loaded headlines, and frantic exclamation points, they are as unappealing to me as the local evening news. The inside of those magazines are just as scattered and hectic as their covers and, as a nanny, the articles themselves, primarily on life as a parent like getting your spouse to help out, sex after kids, how to get your groove back/feel hip, what toys to buy your children next, etc, were not really my niche anyway. And I had a subscription to Martha Stewart Kids for a little while, because I liked the project ideas (though I always adapted them to make them much less involved), but the focus of that magazine has become large, elaborate, professionally catered birthday parties, so I dropped it. Then, I came across Wondertime. While other parenting magazines remind me of parents swapping opinions, advice, and gripes with other parents, this is more like what a child would tell you if he could: for example, what makes a playroom truly functional to a child -an article which begins with a mother realizing her formal dining room is a waste of space and which I wish I could give to every family I've ever worked with. The article "come play with me" in the summer 2006 issue begins "Does being a grown-up mean you've outgrown child's play? C'mon, you know you have it in you. Here are some playful ideas for outing your inner child." And it actually is a perspective on how to enjoy it -not tips on how to cope with the fact that you find it mind-numbingly boring or must endure it as necessary "quality time." The article "a broom of one's own" talks about how much children love being included, in helping, in doing something themselves. Toys mentioned in here are things like mirrors, sand, water, and the great outdoors (and in that sense the advertisements in here seem really out of place).  I also deeply appreciate the magazine's attitude towards children and learning. In other magazines, there is an abundance of advice on how to ensure you are stimulating your children as much as possible, how to manipulate their play and exploration, how to make everything into a language game, everything into a quiz, everything into the kind of lesson in which the adult is in charge of the show and puts the child through his paces. This magazine, at least for now, takes the approach that Learning Happens. Allow it to happen and allow yourself to enjoy being around it. I love that. I can't wait to see the third issue 
The title of this magazine caught my eye on the newstand - and I'm glad I bought the first issue! As a first time, new mom there were many articles that inspired and encouraged me. If you want to learn to journey with your children as they wonder about the world around them while understanding how they develop and teaching them, give this magazine a try! The first issue discussed everything from setting up a play room so children can explore safely and be responsible for their stuff to tree climbing and nature walks, as well as advice on first time pet ownership for preschooler and learning to tell time. I am planning on subscribing and can't wait to see what comes next! Wondertime is a delightful departure from the typical parenting magazine that has articles about how to get your child to do what you want them to do, or cause you to worry that you will destroy your childs future forever unless you buy them this or that new product. Instead, you will learn how your child is growing, how you can teach them more about things they are interested in and ideas for exploring the world together. It is uplifting, encouraging, values wonder, exploration, nature and children aws well as the special relationship between them and their parents. 
Bridal Guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon. This magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable. Besides the fashion, one can read about wedding planning, honeymoon ideas, photography, and other wedding- related things. When you read a copy of Bridal Guide, what stands out more than anything are the photos. This is the main reason people read this magazine in the first place: To look at wedding attire and compare different styles. Models wearing wedding gowns are abundant in this publication and some of the bridal gowns they adorn are quite stunning. To help future brides make a possible purchase, it is common to find a phone number and/or a web site with the majority of the photos. Bridal attire is the main focus of this magazine, but there are also some pictures of grooms and of other wedding party members, with models displaying other fashions for sale, once again complete with phone number and web page. The part of this magazine that focuses its attention on honeymoons and travel is probably my favorite part of the issue. What I like is the fact that this is one part of the magazine that can appeal/apply to anyone, regardless of marital status. These honeymoon tips and destination information provide some good reading material for the bride to be or anyone else who happens to read the magazine. Bridal Guide is a very lengthy publication, with each issue containing around 500 pages! This is more than double the length of most other magazines and it can make the issue seem a little overwhelming at times. Also, this magazine is saturated with ads. Since the majority of the gown- clad models are, in effect, advertisements for a specific fashion brand, one can expect to find ads covering the vast majority of this magazine's pages. This could be annoying to some, but one must bear in mind that the magazine's focus is wedding planning, so excessive advertising is expected. For young brides- to- be or bridal wannabes, this is a handy magazine to have around. It's very long, but it contains lots of fashion and wedding planning ideas to make the big day one to remember forever. 
I love food, and I love this magazine because its editors love food, and they seem to really want everyone to enjoy great food. I have picked up a few issues ( now recently subscribed!) and am always blown away by the photography and the fact that when I try a recipe...it looks just as good and tastes great! Recipes are pretty simple, and to keep things interesting, a really cool new fruit or vegetable is introduced to experiment with. Have to go make something to eat.......... 
Ive been receiving Intermezzo almost since it started and it has really given me a love for food. Simply looking throught the colorful and elegant pages I get hungry. Moreover, it has wonderful recepies and lovely articles, they are always quite interesting. It's one of those magazines thats just a pleasure to look at and to read. It really has some great ideas. Id recommend it to anyone 
Intermezzo is beyond excellent, a breath of fresh ar in a tired food-mag marketplace, and it gets better very single issue. Not only is is the most interesting and beautifully photographed food magazine (the recipes are EXCELLENT, fresh and unpretentious), but I have found customer service to be nothing short of superb. I have had to email customer service three times to adjust/append my orders and have received, in every single case, a pleasant and helpful response within 24 hours. Try getting that from any of the other mags! My issues have arrived without incident. I do wish that they would publish more often, but only because the magazine is so good I want more of it. Do not hesitate to buy this fantastic magazine. 
This is the greatest cooking magazine I have ever subscribed to. I highly recommend it to all those who love food! All the recipes are simple and wonderful, no crazy specialty ingredients are needed 
I received my first issue of Intermezzo after receiving the subscription as a gift from my Wishlist. I LOVED IT! There were a variety of articles and the magazine talks about food, wine, home and garden, and travel. It's exactly the type of magazine that I enjoy. I can't wait for the next issue to arrive! Addendum: The second issue is even better! What a pleasure 
I have simply an amateur's interest in design, and, while ID is directed at the professional, I find every issue is a cornucopia of ideas and of cutting edge design. Further, the Amazon rate is 'considerably' below any other offer I have seen. What's there not to like? 
I like this magazine a lot. I also get Military history and World War 2 magazine and this is my favorite of the three. The best thing about military history magazines in general is getting a new issue in and learning about something you had no idea happened. An example would be England ruling Argentina and the Philippines, did you know that had happened? I sure didn't. Also you will read, like in this issue I have here, about a battle contingency England had to invade the Washington territory in 1861 at the start of the Civil War; it's stuff like this that keeps me very interested in reading this magazine more so than the World War 2 stuff that I've probably over read (although it's in here also). Great glossy paper and pictures also makes it stand out from my other subscriptions, highly recommended. 
Military Heritage appears to me to be a more scholarly magazine than Military History of which I also am a subscriber. This magazine will appeal to the Historian as well a the lay reader. I find the book reviews most incisive and helpful 
One the best military history magazines on the market. Always well written with articles from diverse and well balanced historical periods. Highly recommended 
Hobby Farms magazine provides an enticing look at rural life, giving advice to people who are new to country living. There are lots of sources for making this transition easier. The emphasis is on 'hobby' as no one expects to make much of a living on a small farm today. The advertising section also provides many sources of livestock and other 'necessities' of rural life 
I read Successful Farming, Progressive Farming and Backwoods Home for years. They are all fine magazines. But if you want to do a little hobby farm this magazine really fits. They have a wealth of information in each copy. I'm really impressed. It's really targeted to those people who have five to thirty acres, a few animals and may or may not want to make a little money on this side or as minimum have fun but do it the right way. My first copy was their tractor issue. Very good info. And I'm an engineer 
Love this magazine! Just wish it came out more often. Great for more than those with farms or homesteads. Articles on gardening, building projects, animals. Buy It 
This magazine is my dream magazine. I subscribed to it immediately after reading a few articles while my parents were shopping at the tractor supply store. It has quite a few useful articles covering everything from animal health to hoof trimming, to special breed information and generators. I think it's a must for anyone who has ever been interested in farming or ranching, or just getting back to the country life 
My husband and I have bought the past 2 issues of Hobby Farms, and we really enjoy it! It always has articles about organic methods for gardening, interesting information about animals you might not have considered (this month, Dairy Sheep!), equipment for use on the small farm, and a variety of other useful bits of information. Similar to magazines like OG &amp; Mother Earth News, but more focused on specific information for "back to the farm" individuals and lots more info on animals instead of just gardening. It has fewer ads than most magazines, but the ads are still there... but at least they're grouped next to articles that have a similar topic 
I read the first copy of my gift subscription from cover to cover. My wife, who gave me the gift, knew that I always pick up Scientific American whenever we go to the library so her gift was pretty much a sure bet. Over the years Scientific American has clearly made a big effort to make its articles much more readable by people with a normal education. At no time was I overwhelmed by scientific shorthand. Neither was I presented with high level concepts that assumed I would bring the necessary (sometimes esoteric) intellectual framework needed to understand them 
For those who are curious about the world of Science, this is a good magazine. There is no dumbing down here as is common in "Popular Science." There is a balance of articles covering Technology, Astronomy, Archaeology, and Geology. The four things that I like most, are the detailed articles, the corresponding references, it is accessible to persons who do not have a science background, the ads are at a minimum. Perhaps, it is not as good as some reviewers stated that it was five years ago? I can't comment on that, I have only been reading it for two years 
Without a doubt Scientific American is the best magazine to keep you updated on the latest news and findings from AI to Quantum Physics! 
If you're a fan of science, this is a great magazine that covers a wide range of topics. Most of the time the topics are over my head, but the magazine gives you enough information to get the gist of it and prompt you to learn more about it. The subscription definitely took about 6-8 weeks to kick in, but they did send me 2 consecutive issues to make up for the delay. I would definitely recommend this magazine 
An excellent source of interesting science and technology articles. The magazine covers a variety of topics, and presents information so the reader's knowledge base is enhanced and challenged. Illistrations, within the perodical, further enhance the reader's grasp of the topic material, all excellently done. A must read for those who desire a deeper understanding of our technical, scientific world, and cosmos. 
I guess I still subscribe for the pictures. ;-) Yes, there was a time when Scientific American was so difficult to read and understand that I always felt like an idiot, even when I was an award-winning physics major in college (yeah, hard to believe!). Now it's a great way to keep up with cutting-edge scientific thought. I still don't entirely grasp the latest String Theories or Loop Quantum Gravity, but I can read those articles and--admittedly with the help of graphics--get an idea of the implications of the theories, and how they work with or conflict with other theories. Most of the hard-core articles are still written by research scientists, but these authors have become better writers, and they have learned that the audience is like me: The general population, wanting to keep up on the latest cool stuff. There are still purely scientific periodicals where they can publish their equations and use the latest jargon. I'm thankful they "dumb it down" for the rest of us. In a time when good science is often dismissed by the general public in favor of "What the BLEEP..." and other popularized pseudo-science, I am incredibly thankful that Scientific American is still true to the scientific method. 
This science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person. Articles are good, not overly technical in depth. At times it gets in its doldrums of articles, but generally it holds it own. You don't have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same. But it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot. It does at times takes some thought of getting used to. Their 'special topic issues' may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic.Well received for the high-schooler either as the magazine or the website. At least the layperson can be science informed. The title of the magazine says it all 
If you like tuner cars then you will like this! This magazine has great information and great pictures. They tell you about all the new parts, how u can get parts for cheap and how to install. I would also have to say this is the most attractive tuner magazine on the market. Great design Great pictures Great information Great magazine 
I subscribe to all the major tuner magazines, but the only one I look forward to receiving in my mailbox each month is Modified. The content is hard core, photos are excellent, and the overall layout and design of the magazine is by far the best of the group. These guys seem to really live and breath the sport compact performance scene - they have an edge the others don't - I will likely only renew this mag and let the others lapse 
Car and Driver is the quintessential automotive publication. The format is very user-friendly and the reporting accurate, leaving sensationalism to the other publications. That being said, the magazine is not what it once was. As others have updated their style and photography, most notably Motor Trend, Car and Driver soldiers on with its now-familiar format. And the recent departure of Brock Yates, second only to David E. Davis in automotive journalism god-ness, the magazine moves in the wrong direction. Time will tell whether Csabe Csere (the editor) can restore its preeminence 
If you like cars then Car and Driver is the magazine for you.The writers are the best and the articles are informitive 
Car and Driver is the best of the automotive- related magazines. It features numerous road tests and comparisons designed to help the consumer make a better buying decision. Most of the articles in Car and Driver deal with statistics. The magazine features several vehicles each month with loads of information on each one. They cover things like the engine size, length and width of the vehicle, acceleration rate, braking distance and much, much more. The facts are presented in an unbiased, informative way. The writers don't try to promote one car over another. They want you to know the basics and then decide for yourself which vehicle best suits your needs. In addition to individual ratings, Car and Driver also features head- to- head comparisons among vehicles in a specific category. For example, one months' featured article might be on minivans. The magazine will select a group of vehicles from this category, rate then on a scale from 1 to 10 in several categories, like handling, brakes, ride, engine, styling, etc, and then tally up the points and announce the winner. This is very useful to a potential buyer because it allows him/her to make a side by side comparison of similar vehicles. car and Driver doesn't necessarily push one brand over another because even though their point system might result in one vehicle rating superior, there are specific qualities, options, and features of certain vehicles that will make them more appealing than others- even those that rate slightly higher. The only bad point that I can come up with for this magazine is its lack of personal stories. Car and Driver is an informational magazine, with very little in the way of stories with a personal touch. If that is what you like in a magazine, then Car and Driver may not be very appealing to you. It is basically a magazine full of facts and figures. Car and Driver wants you, the consumer, to know the facts: The average distance needed to brake, the acceleration rate, the engine size, and other vital statistics. It doesn't waste its time talking about people and their cars. It concentrates only on the cold, hard facts. If you are looking for information on your next new vehicle, Car and Driver is the magazine to buy. I read several automotive magazines and they all have something to offer but Car and Driver is my favorite in its genre. It has all the data you need to make an informed buying decision. 
Car and Driver is definitely the best automotive magazine in the world. This magazine has something for everybody, whether your a person just looking for a new car or a serious car enthusiast. I have been a Car and Driver sucscriber for 6 years now and I regularly purchase the other three popular, monthly car magazines (Motor Trend, Road Track, and Automobile). By far Car and Driver is the best of the four, testing more automobiles per issue (about least twice as many as Road Track per year), conducting larger comparison tests, and generally being the most enjoyable. Car and Driver is also greater fun to read as the editors are very prone to jokes and wisecracks, and not afraid to write how they really feel about a car, no matter how good or bad it is. The road tests are comprehensive with a long list of tests performed for every vehicle, and the good points and bad points listed along with a sentence summary of the vehicle. All the reviews are unbiased (mostly), and all vehicles are compared to similar cars in the same class. The bottom line: If you want a magazine that tests more motor vehicles than any other American car magazine, prints accurate specifications and performance tests results on each one, and includes autosport articles and up to date auto news, yet you don't want to fall asleep reading it, Car and Drvier is the magazine for you.  
Very colorful photos, informative articles written by subscribers and bird watching nuts like me! Tips on feeding birds, gardening, etc. Extremely informative magazine. Not a page of it wasted. There's as much info in the magazine on "birds" as there is on "blooms" so regardless of your interest, you'll enjoy the publication. I look forward to it every other (bimonthly publication) month and have gleaned a lot of tips on attracting, feeding and identifying birds as well as planting tips for flowers 
I would love to subscribe to Olive, but I can't justify it. I understand the subscription includes airmail, but STILL! I can buy single issues at a store near my home, and even at retail prices, 12 issues cost less than does a subscription. But, to give you an idea how good a magazine this is, every single month I deliberately make the trek to the store to buy a copy. If you were looking at a marketing description, Olive would seem like Real Simple, or a magazine of its ilk, but somehow I find it more satisfying than those perfectly nice publications that I never find anything that makes me say, "Let's make that this weekend." I'm not sure how to describe the reasons why. Olive could be subtitled "Food, Wine, and Travel for busy people," because it emphasizes tasty meals without fuss. Each issue has a section with 5-10 dinners you can get on the table in 30 minutes; plus a "weekend cooking" section for the dishes you're willing to fiddle with; plus a section on cooking what's fresh in the market right now. (The issue I picked up today has three recipes that feature peas, for instance.) It ranges from exotic Thai curries to fish and chips. There are also restaurant reviews and travel (more "travel for foodies" -- they expend some energy telling you where to eat). I have cooked at least one dish from nearly every issue, and every single one of them has been a winner. These aren't necessarily "company cooking," though some of the recipes certainly qualify. However, their "fast food" section is exactly what I want: a real meal that's feasible in the middle of the week. Among my favorites is a chicken-mushroom-wine stew in pastry. It really DID take a half hour, start to finish, in part because it instructs you to use store-bought puff pastry. And man, was it tasty. That would be enough... but the fun extra is that this is a British magazine, put out by the BBC. When they do taste-tests of tea or chocolate or ketchup, the brands are what's available in the UK. Although I recognize a few brands, the results aren't terribly useful; but I think it's a hoot. (What can I say? My idea of a cool thing to do on vacation in a foreign country is to go grocery shopping.) Nor are most of the restaurant reviews likely to be relevant; but then, a NY Times restaurant review isn't going to help me, either. I can still enjoy it. I can't imagine you'll spend this kind of money without seeing an issue. If you've seen a copy and wondered if its quality holds up... I assure you, it does. The only food magazine that I think is of equal quality in the U.S. is Fine Cooking, and it has a different angle 
I've been a longtime subscriber to Men's Fitness. As one of the other reviewers said, this magazine used to be better. It still has a great deal of workout, diet and fitness information, but it's not as good as it once was. I think the magazine is losing its focus a bit as each issue does seem to have more and more about sex, pornography, etc. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because a lot of the workout and fitness information is still very useful (otherwise I would give it fewer), but I used to feel this magazine was worthy of 5 stars 
Men's Fitness is an excellent magazine with plenty of interesting articles on health and other issues 
This publication is in my opinion, the most comprehensive and up to date review of space technology, military and commercial aviation, and to a certain extent, general aviation I have ever read. I have been subscribing to this magazine for years, and would have no idea where to go to get the information they provide, should I ever stop subscribing. That, however, will never happen! 
It is very difficult to rate this item when I haven't even received the first issue. My rating is from my past memories of the magazine 
I gave this magazine to a best friend, a retired Army Signal Corps officer, for Christmas and he can't thank me enough or praise the magazine enough. He pulled out a copy to show me a couple of the articles he's been reading. He really likes the variety of subjects from all time periods and various countries...which is what made me pick this magazine over others. I am happy he is thrilled with the magazine which he will receive throughout the year. He started recieving them the first of the year. I ordered it about December 10th 
The only magazine I devour the moment it arrives in the mail. I keep them to re-read favorite articles again and again. In depth analysis and wonderful artwork are in every issue. It is a must have for the serious student of military history and for the amateur historian as well. 
I first picked up a copy of this magazine off of a newstand over 20 years ago. In that magazine, I read the most thrilling account of the Battle at Trafalger I believe I have ever read. I was imediately hooked on this magazine and have been ever since. In over 20 years of being a subscriber, I can honestly say I have never yet been dissappointed in an issue. The articles never fail to be well written, well edited, accurate and concise. I think what I prefer most with this magazine over others is that, my history interests are quite diverse, as is MILITARY HISTORY magazine. You will not find just one article after another on the same war, or even from the same century, but rather a fine mixture to satisfy all your interests. This is the magazine subscription I would want if I were stranded on a deserted island 
I have only recieved a few issues of Military History, but I have been extrodinarily pleased. There is a very diverse selection of articles, so I am always learning something new. Topics range from specific individuals to whole forces, from book reviews to technichal equipment information. I have found that the writers generally assume that the reader has some advance knowledge of the subject, so this may not the best magazine for someone new to military history. Still, this magazine is well worth the money for anyone who truly has an interest in military history 
I regularly look forward to my copy of Military History. It is a quality publication that is crammed with interesting articles about warfare in the past. I have found very few errors in the magazine and it is very professionally presented. The photos and diagrams are very well done and the magazine always has a interesting mix of articles from different time periods. Highly recommended to those interested in the subject 
Most knitting mags are full of synthetic looking projects that are often stuck in the 80s. While not every project appeals to me (I usually find 3 or 4 each issue), all are high quality, classy, and call for high quality fibers. What I am just begining to notice are the interesting articles. Focusing on the art and history of knitting, it is the Smithsonian of knitting! Since reading some of these articles, I have a new respect for knitters of the past, and a new pride in my work today. A must for any serious knitter 
Every issue has at least one thing I want to knit, usually more. I'm an advanced beginner, so I'm saving all my issues for when I'm more able to make some of the more advanced patterns. The photos are lovely, and the things in the magazine are, for the most part, something you or someone you know would wear! 
Interweave Knits (IK) magazine is, by far, the best knitting magazine on the newsstand. Over the years, I have checked out all of them and there are several reasons why this publication is a "keeper" everytime it arrives. Each issue provides a bountiful assortment of projects. Also, there are clear, well-written instructions for each project and a primer on some aspect of the craft. Every issue includes the basics including a glossary and stitch illustrations. The projects are well written, well illustrated and down to earth. Unlike another high-profile knitting magazine which focuses on haute couture, IK's projects are personable and "user-friendly." In fact, all of Interweave's publications are top-notch 
There's a lot I could say about IK, but I don't want to write one of those long winded reviews. Here's the short list of why IK is worth every single penny. 1. Interweave Knits doesn't insult your intelligence as a knitter. They don't publish a magazine that's the equivelant of gilding the swine. 2. The patterns are by and large wearable, not to mention flattering. Real people, in a range of sizes, can wear most of the patterns. They also include patterns that go up to plus sizes, though not all do. 3. It's a great value. In any given issue I can find at least 3 patterns I'd love to make, 2 articles that are genuinely informative and interesting, technique explanations that are concise and useful, and those great essays on the last page. 4. They include patterns in a variety of styles, including socks, lace shawls, felted, and your standard clothing in just about every single issue. 5. Bonus patterns are included on the website for subscribers. 6. The magazine doesn't make you curl your mouth up in disgust and wonder what in heaven the editors were thinking while muttering under your breath, wondering if they dropped acid in their younger days. 
Knits is the standard to which I hold all other knitting and crocheting, and for that matter, all crafts and DIY magazines. It's that well done: thoughtful, clarified, and styley 
Nowadays a magazine can easily rival a book in cost. So how come they are still in business? In the case of "Interweave Knits" published four times a year by Interweave Press, it is not hard to figure out. Innovative artists, useful articles, intriguing ads. The magazine is more of a trade magazine for the Knitting culture. Yes there are some really weird designs in this magazine. Yet there are also some traditional, in style and color. You can not help but find your project in every issue. The projects come with complete instructions and diagrams. I personally like the ads for different tools as ball winders, and yarns. It is interesting what you can learn from them alone. Still the magazine goes deeper with excerpts from the latest books and other sources. 
I subscribed to this magazine one year ago. Out of the four issues I've received this year, I've knitted at least one project idea from each issue, and three so far from the fall issue alone (!) and each has turned out beautifully. I haven't read any other knitting magazines that appeal to me as consistently as this one. I've noticed that each issue has a careful balance of projects, appealing to both genders and to all levels of knitting expertise. Each issue contains a few "gee-whiz!" type articles in the front with interesting, exotic and sometimes downright weird news about the knitting world (like, who knew that knitting could be considered performance art?). There's usually an exotic "catch-the-eye" or cutting-edge fashion project, followed by other apparel projects that are always beautiful, visually appealing and frequently wearable, too! Although the magazine does occasionally include items that make me shake my head in disbelief, Interweave Knits generally seems to select projects that real humans can wear without looking like freaks. You'll also find a couple of ideas for non-apparel and/or "quick gift"-type projects in each issue, ranging from felted backpacks and novelty purses to baby hats. Now, if all this sounds good, just wait: it gets better. The real clincher for me is that the patterns seem to have been tested and carefully proof-read BEFORE going to press. I've worked 7 projects from IWK this year, and have yet to catch a single mistake in pattern directions! Maybe I've just been lucky so far, but I noticed on the IWK website that the list of errata is amazingly short...so either they don't update errata onto their website, or they really don't allow a lot of mistakes to slip through. In short, I think "Interweave Knits" provides a lot of bang for your subscription bucks. Two thumbs up from me 
This is a literary magazine, and as you would expect it deals with the current events of the literary world with reviews of current books, articles on upcoming authors, etc. However it also adds features on classics (articles on classic authors, investigations into themes which span the ages, etc.) which give it a good amount of historical perspective. Its opinions and reviews are so much more valuable because they are usually quite level-headed, and avoid the "flavor of the month" syndrome of other magazines which are just fronts for editors' publicity outfits. 4,5 stars would have been a more fitting rating, but since the option is not available, I'll round it upwards to five 
E MAGAZINE is chocked full of everything the intelligent resident of Earth needs to know, from "rainforests to recycling" and the "personal to the political." Published bimonthly by the Earth Action Network, each edition contains thorough reports on key environmental issues and trend, consumer product updates, food and environmental health issues, commentary from leading thinkers and doers, and coverage of major events and conferences. What's most reassuring about E is that it's not a doom-and-gloom publication. The focus is awareness--updates on biotech, wildlife, climate change and toxic threats--and practical advice. Be it information on herbal alternatives, fruits that ease the aging process or the top 10 rules of eco-travel, E educates readers--and hopefully--policymakers alike. 
Although it took 2 months for the first subscription to arrive, the magazine was great 
I recently subscribed to E! and the two magazines I have read have had some great articles 
I have chosen an eclectic method of educating my children that includes using real books and hands on activities. This magazine offers articles and projects that make my lesson planning easier. I recommend subscribing to those who take a strong approach to history and enjoy learning about real life in the past. 
My dream job would be to write for this magazine! I absolutely adore every single thing about it! A fabulous job is done of putting together expertly researched articles in an easy-to-understand style. With the increase of environmental allergies and the reality of global warming, this magazine is extremely relevant and delivers (recycled) rain barrels of inspiration! Without a doubt its readership will only grow in years to come, which will hopefully encourage publication to increase from 6 to 12 times per year. A lot of soul obviously goes into putting this magazine together - a joy to learn from and read 
This is a magazine that will appeal to a select crowd of people who like Helen and Scott nearing who lived in Maine or those of us in California or the South west and possibly the North west areas like Washington and Oregon love the out of doors and value simplicity in home design and care. Some of the article are so wonderful and we have put many to actual use. Like the recent articles on Hot water systems like those common in Scandinavia and Japanese homes. or straw or pounded earth homes that save heating and cooling costs and are better in areas where there may be earthquakes or fires. Articles on nontoxic and environmentally safe paints and finishes. Even the value of sun or air drying clothing. Or caring for ones pets, naturally. Non toxic fleas and pest control. And simple elegant recipes and numerous resources for the reader to check out. Most by the way, can be researched online 
One reason I adore Knitter's is that they sell yarn packs for the projects on their website. Few things are more frustrating than finding a pattern in a yarn and color you love and not being able to find the yarn anywhere! If only more magazines would do this 
Living far away, I get my magazines weeks after it is on the streets in US. This waiting period is long! I hope for the mag every day, and send at least two impatient e-mails to the customers service. In Norway we havent got knitting mags you can read,only with patterns. I have been knitting all my life, my hobby has been much more satisfactory after I found Knitting (and Interweave Knits). I find patterns that I want to knit, get ideas how I can knit something other on the basis of a pattern. I can plan what I will knit next year, buying a lot of yarn for future projets! The informations I get about American knitting women, makes me happy! Grete 
I received my first issue a few weeks ago. There are several patterns in this issue that I will knit, and some maybe's. I buy many knitting magazines in stores, mainly because I want to check them out before I buy. This magazine is a consistant purchase for me, which is why I finally subscribed. (I also enjoy most of Interweave, Vogue Knitting, Rebecca, and Creative Knitting, though I have chosen not to subscribe to them. Usually not enough patterns in them that I would knit. 
"Knitters" is my all around favorite knitting magazine. I've been reading it almost since the beginning and am a current subscriber. "Knitters" designers are some of the most knowledgeable creative in the business, and the patterns in each issue range from simple to complex. The designs may not be quite as trendy as those in "Vogue Knitting" (sometimes that's a plus) but they're generally stylish, wearable, and pleasantly challenging to knit. Each issue has a mix of articles that treat the featured techniques in depth and that deal with more general topics. I'm not an expert knitter by any means, but the projects I've done from "Knitters" have given me a much better understanding of the craft and a sense that I can successfully tackle projects that would have been too complex before. "Knitters" is a magazine that encourages me stretch my knitting muscles in a way that the other magazines don't 
I particularly love the format of patterns presented in the magazine--easy to follow, helpful sidebar with all the key info, and well written. They are presented just like in Sally Melville's Knit Stitch and Purl Stitch books, which I love (XRX publishes both the magazine and those books). I find that there are many "how to" articles that help me as an advanced beginner/early intermediate knitter. Again, the instructions are clear, as are the accompanying graphics/photos. I am holding on to the articles that cover more advanced techniques, and will go back to them once I think I'm ready. The only downside to this magazine for me is that there tend to be few patterns that I want to knit. This is purely a matter of taste; I highly recommend going to their website and checking through the archives to get a feel for the patterns. That said, the few I have made from Knitter's have been among my favorite items I've knit. I just made a sweater ("Swing Set") for my picky daughter from last fall's Knitter's, and she adores it. The whole process went smoothly from start to finish, and I love the results. Lastly, I like the fact that this magazine offers a wide range of complexity levels in their patterns. There are always plenty of choices for knitters like me, who aren't up to anything too complex. I've tried Interweave Knits as well, and find that their patterns are mostly way too complex and intricate for me (also, the pattern format is difficult to follow, in my opinion). I only wish the patterns in Knitter's fit better with my personal style more often 
I love this magazine for 3 reasons: 1) Most of the patterns have plus sizes, at least to 1X, but often 2X and 3X as well. 2) Patterns are designed to minimize sewing. Sweaters are usually knit in the round, and cardigan bodies are knit in one piece. 3) There's always a new technique or two featured. I learned how to do several advanced techniques from this magazine (e.g. entrelac, mosaic knitting, double-knitting), including some lesser known ones such as brioche patterns where multiple long yarn-over stitches are worked into eyelets within the lacework of the rows below ("Stripes à L`Orange" in issue K75 which you can preview on their web site - the stitch pattern looks like maple leaves!). 
I've been knitting most of my life and have subscribed to this magazine for over 4 years. Each issue has a theme--cable patterns, stripes, unisex sweaters, colors, knitting for children, etc. I find that even if the theme doesn't interest me, the magazine is always worth perusing. Each issue includes a "how to" section that will satisfy even the most experienced knitters. Articles have covered knitting in darts, reversible cables, and several aspects of designing. Recently the magazine was improved by listing yarn weights as well as the original yarns used in the patterns, which makes substitutions much easier. Most of the patterns are sweaters in classic styles with a few modern designs thrown in. While not in every issue, there have been many children's sweaters included. Issues often include other items, such as hats, scarves, shawls, Christmas ornaments &amp; decorations, purses, socks, gloves and mittens. The magazine has also featured several "great American afghans," providing a few block designs in each magazine. This is no granny-square afghan pattern. All patterns I have tried have been easy to follow, providing both written instructions and graphs 
While sometimes the designs in this knitting magazine are a bit wacky, the knitting know-how and articles on the craft are great. Even better, the photos, which are absolutely incredible. The new editor, Rick Mondragon, has come into his own and produced some really fine issues with many exciting projects small and large to knit. And Knitters sponsors the annual Stitches East, West, and (maybe still) Midwest conventions, where you can meet the designers, take classes and buy yarn at the Market. It's almost a cult 
Probably the best magazine on sportbikes and performance motorcycles I've ever read. Full of pertinent information on the latest machines, plus it has tips on riding techniques, which I find invaluable. The editors seem to have more insight into what makes performance motorcycles work than the other magazines 
Of all the motorcycle magazines I've been able to get in the U.S., Sport Rider is the only one that is dedicated to Sport Bikes. It has great reviews on new bikes, tips on riding, racing news, and great reviews on Sport Bike products (i.e. the best helmets). If you're like me and you're not too interested in cruisers or touring bikes, but you are big into Sport Bikes, this is your magazine 
Among the constellation of golf magazines, GOLF WORLD is the one that isn't straining to be a lifestyle magazine with golf thrown in. With a look and feel similar to US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT, this golf newsweekly serves up the news, most of the news, and little else besides the news of the golf world. It's refreshingly thin and direct to the point. Shockingly, even the advertisements promote golf rather than luxury products. Just the news 
This was given as a gift to a first time bird owner. She is thrilled with the magazine and learning from it daily. Every novice bird owner should have this magazine on hand 
I have been a reader for a few years. The pictures alone are worth the price. I always learn something new 
This is a great magazine with good articles. Gear'd mostly towards the everyday pet owner though it does on occassion cover breeding of more "known" species. I would love to see more exotic breeds of parrots, finches, etc. I usually seek out BirdTimes if I want to learn about more scientific facts and more exotic birds 
I love this magazine. It has very informative articles. There are also cute pictures and each month they have a focus on a different breed of bird. This magazine is a must for any bird owner 
I do not read magazines until a friend shared bird talk with me and now I try to wait patiently for the next issue! Fantastic magazine for all bird owners. 
A must have for all Bird lovers. Very cheap price too. Very informative and 2 page posters inside every issue 
We've had a subscription to BIRD TALK magazine for two years, and I just renewed for a third. BT is the magazine to read if you want to go beyond books. Articles in BT are written by various bird lovers, many of whom, like Mattie Sue Athan, have also written book or two. Many of the BT authors are avian veterinarians and many like Athan breed and raise and/or rehabilitate parrots or are simply extremely knowledgeable about companion birds. I find the monthly collection of articles very diverse-important to me as I have 18 companion birds, of 8 different kinds. BT carries plenty of information about excellent bird resources- suppliers, breeders, avian vets, etc. as well as toy makers and food suppliers). I found an advertisement for a small mom and pop organization in California that manufactures play gyms and stands using old grape vines from the vineyards. These vines are harvested as the vineyards are replenished with new plants. Grape vine play gyms are wonderful fun for the birds-exercising bars as well as chewing toys-and great for giving the old beak a workout on something other than your ear or hand. Every month a different bird is featured on the cover, and in the lead article and centerfold. I saved the Senegal centerfold to hang in my office and remind me of my own little `Bertie' the Senegal when I am at work. I hand my copies of BT to my granddaughters after I have read them cover to cover and they have used the centerfolds to decorate their room. BT recently carried an article on feather-plucking and we all read it as one of the Cockatiels had developed this bad habit. Following the advice in the article, we had the vet check Quincy out and when she pronounced him disease free, we began to examine factors in his environment. We were able to get to the root of the problem and now Quincy is his old self. Thanks BIRD TALK, keep up the great work. Periodically, the book includes a feature article on an endangered species, environmentally sensitive bird habitat and/or and Ecotour. Bird companions are often also avian conservationists. 
I ordered this magazine for my husband, but ever since the first issue arrived I've been hooked. (My sister picked up one of our copies while visiting and was instantly hooked too. So, I ordered her a subscription for Christmas.) I've been a fan of the show for some time, but have found the magazine much more useful as far as everyday application of knowledge gained. It's given me (oh, and my husband) lots of practical but brilliant ideas. I'm planning on putting in a butler's pantry in the kitchen this spring. I have to confess one of my favorite things about the magazine is the letter from the editor that sets-up the issue. He's just a witty, salt-of-the-earth kinda guy and I always laugh at his stories. The only downside to the magazine is that some of the houses in the feature articles have had 100's of thousands of dollars spent on their remodels. My husband and I are D.I.Y.ers, not people who could hire a contractor to add another 1000 sq. feet to our house. Even still, I do glean good ideas from those spreads of palatial remodels. One more thing, their website is incredibly helpful and easy to navigate, so check that out too 
Must-have magazine for anyone with a house! No kidding -- it offers hints, tips and help for old and new homes. Everything is tackled: plumbing, roofing, painting, restoring, etc. Great housewarming gift! 
This magazine keeps me coming back for more. Each month might not have something I can use but inspires me to do more and do things myself!! 
I've found that the magazine is a good companion to the TV program. Where the TV program often deals with home projects that are far outside the average person's economic means (unlike its early days), this magazine offers details and hints that are useful for all homeowners that like to swing hammers and delight in "demo dust" 
I gave this as a gift during the holidays and the recepient is very happy with the magazine! It actually came earlier than the estimated 12 week period so they received their gift early 
Great photos- patterns are hit or miss, but that's not unusual. I'd suggest this to any knitter 
I learned to knit as a young girl and then life interfered and I dropped out of the craft. About 10 years ago, I picked up a copy of VK and got hooked all over again. The styles in this publication are chic, stylish, and adaptable. Most are for clothing and accessories without the ubiquitous afghan designs. The directions are clear and only once have I encountered an error. The articles are interesting, informative, and often inspire creativity and exploration. As soon as the latest issue hits the mailbox, I'm into it from cover to cover. There are 10 years of issues catalogued in my bookshelf and I refer to them often. A great resource for any knitter 
Being a fashion geek who loves to knit, for me, this magazine rises above all the rest. Like the previous reviewer, I wish they come out monthly rather than quarterly. It's a long 3 months til your next issue. Maybe Vogue wants to give you time to finish your knitting projects before giving you new ones. :) Nevertheless, it remains the most fashionable knitting mag around. 
A bit more geared to the wealthy than I anticipated. I plan on traveling during my impending retirement but really can not afford most of the destinations they have covered thus far. Still, it is very interesting reading and I do not regret the purchase 
If your are interested in travel, culture, dining, society, or photography, this is absolutely the magazine for you. Each issue is chock full of travel ideas that go above and beyond the boring tourist traps, and digs deep into a destinations culture and individuality. Also, giving you vivid photographic illustrations that the National Geographic Society is world renowned for 
Unlike other travel magazines, this one provides a lot of useful information while holding advertising to a minimum and not interlarding promos throughout the articles (Rick Steves, are you listening?). Each issue contains a wide variety of material about diferent parts of the world and the information provided for featured destinations is truly useful. In other words, the information is trustworthy, the first prerequisite for a travel magazine. Production quality is excellent; this is a magazine you will leave out on your coffee table. Surprisingly, the website stinks. Not even subscribers are able to access many of the articles on line, and the weekly A-List of special deals is unimaginative and seems to focus on useless extravagances (lots of spa get-a-ways) 
Great price for 2 year subscription, received the first copy within 4 weeks of subscribing! 
I order tons of magazines online and have never been as thrilled as I have been with my amazon purchase. So many companies state "6-8" weeks to begin, I got my first issue 10 DAYS after ordering it! Would highly recommend this servic 
The Address label is wrong for proper delivery. Has street address instead of Post Office Box 
This came promptly and is a "joy " to read. It is very informative for all types of golfers, women and men,low and high handicappers 
I've had a subscription to this mag for years. Great stories and the photos are top of the line. While it was a much better pub when the NY Times owned it (the people who worked there actually golfed), since Conde has bought it, it's gone downhill a bit. Still, it's hard to kill a great sport 
Golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game. For these types, nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course, but Golf Digest comes very close. This magazine contains over 200 pages each month, dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf. The things that set Golf Digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews. Other golfing publications attempt to help you learn, but they often get too mechanical. Golf Digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals, including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like Tiger Woods. Besides all the tips and tricks, Golf Digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game. This personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine's overall appeal, providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine. Golfing Digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course, but it comes close. I consider it the best publication of its kind and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game. 
Over the many years that I have subscribed to Golf Digest, I've come across extremely useful information from world class teachers and the top players that has improved my game. In addition to appreciating the superb teaching article, I always look forward to the new product editions. Equally informative and entertaining are the various feature article and interviews. Golf Digest is simply the best golf magazine 
This is fun magazine even though I don't cook all the time. It has great recipes and I received it in a timely manner 
I've got subscriptions to 3 cooking magazines (Eating Well, Bon Apetit, and Everyday Food), and this one is by FAR the most useful. I want healthy food but I also work long hours and can't spend a lot of time in the kitchen. The recipes in Eating Well are tasty, easy to make, and creative. The ingredients can be found at any grocery store and are usually things I have on hand. I look forward to every issue to find out what new recipes we'll be cooking up this month. I highly recommend it 
This mag doesn't just cover food and recipes, it also covers nutrition, health and food around the world. Keep on top of the latest health news and nutrition tips. Well researched and well written. Recommended for singles or families concerned with living and eating well 
This magazine is like Prevention, there are articles on eating better, different foods and their nutritional value, and so on. I found them all well done and informative. I especially enjoyed in the last issue a large article on faux foods and the differences between getting a loaf of long shelf life bread, the kind most of us eat, or an artisan loaf of whole wheat and the points as to why we should pick the ones with actual food value over convienence. Most cooking magazines have none to few articles on various topics. Eating Well truly means that - they're telling you about eating well. If you're looking for a magazine with some recipes and more articles that pertain solely to food and their health value then this is one you'll want to check out. I found it a nice change of pace. As stated in another review. There are very few ads which is amazing and very enjoyable. They do have the 'recipes that are different' as I like to call it. They had an appetizer of a dried apricot half topped with crumbled blue cheese, pistachios, honey and a little pepper. It sounds interesting and I would probably try it, but I'm pretty sure I won't make it. They did have some I will try out that looked delicious such as another appetizer of sliced beef wrapped around a dab of boursin and thin sliced peppers, sounds excellent. 
I find that they really focus on one topic at a time and cover it well, then move on to smaller interests. They don't just give you a tid-bit of info on the main cover focus, which is nice. A good invesment for a year subscription. 
I spent a lot of time trying to pick a cooking/nutrition magazine to subscribe to, and this is the one. It has tons of great recipes, nice pictures, and interesting articles that don't repeat the same old food/diet information I've read a hundred times. But probably the thing that sets this magazine apart the most is that compared to every other magazine I've looked at, there are BARELY ANY ADVERTISEMENTS. Nothing makes me feel more ripped off than to find that my magazine is about 40% full page ads. I'm so glad I found one that's not like that 
As a certified Francofreak I can assure you this is a great little mag. This magazine goes WAY beyond the Paris and Provence cliches of a France travel magazines or books.I've read it cover to cover and still can't get enough so I am going to subscribe to the sister mag "Living in France" right now. Pluses: -extremely fast subscription start-up time -covers history, food, culture, real estate, travel etc. etc.. -thourough, in depth, lots of color photos Needs to work on: -color plates are a little washed out -needs more detailed maps ...that's i 
I subscribed to this magazine because I am teaching myself French,and intend to visit France someday.This magazine really makes you want to get there.The photos are beautiful,and the articles are well-written and very informative.I particularly loved the page-by-page journey through very small hamlets and villages. I am learning a lot of different things about France.I intended to only visit Paris,but the descriptions and pictures of other areas of France have convinced me to make it an extended trip when I do go.Those little villages have so much history to show us. I can't recommend this magazine enough.For any Francophiles out there,this is the magazine for you! 
For those of you who love France, the food, the culture, the art architecture, etc., this magazine is definitely for you! Great photos, well-written articles that make you feel like you're there! A pleasure to get every two months. Only complaint: I wish it were Monthly!.. 
If you love France and all things French, then this is the magazine for you. I read it cover to cover whenever it comes out. Articles might be about such well known places as Carcassonne or Avignon. Others are about small-town festivals that you probably have never heard of. If you want to practice your French, then read "Mot à mot" both in French and English. This is a magazine that you will want to keep 
I love this magazine not only for the Camper and RV articles but the great assortment of information on destinations, first aid, buyer's guides etc. And the photography is first rate 
I've now read 4 issues of this magazine and found several projects in each one. For beginners, the tutorials about the special techniques used in each project are especially helpful, and they make a quick review for more-experienced knitters. The 'learn to knit' section in the back of each issue is nearly as comprehensive as many standalone knitting-basics booklets. The projects in each issue's theme are generally diverse, with some patterns being attractive to more traditional or experienced knitters and others appealing to newer or more trend-conscious knitters. 
What a refreshing change to the hum drum knitting magazine. Yes it's a little expensive compared to American magazines, but it's similar to the difference between watching an American movie and a British film. Buy yourself a single copy, sit back with a cup of tea (with milk in it of course!) and enjoy! You'll want the subscription. See what I mean ? 
This is probably the most up to date hair styling magazine I have seen in the US in a long time, most of them seem to come from England. It has some styles that are just a little different than what everyone is wearing and some very classy ideas as well. I really liked it and so did my hairdresser!! 
Since returning from a Tuscan holiday in summer of 2001, I could not get enough "authentic" Italian food to satisfy my now-wiser palate. Enter Italian Cooking and Living (and its sister publication, La Cucina Italiana) to assist me in recreating so many foods I experienced over there. I have never found an issue wanting in ideas and diversity, and of late the format has been enhanced with rich photography and more adventurous dishes. My sole complaint is that it isn't three times bigger, with even more tantalizing recipes :( I did discover quickly that a clear acrylic cookbook stand is essential to keep my copies from getting sauced upon or otherwise soiled. This makes a superb gift, but make sure to order a subscription for yourself as well 
I got a subscription of this magazine for my grandpa and grandma for Christmas. They absolutley love the magazine and can't live without it. This magazine is full of great recipes that my grandma enjoys, and also news and information that my grandpa lusts after. News, that you don't hear everyday on the radio or news, news that 80 year old Grandparents LOVE and enjoy. I plan on getting this magazine for them again and again 
Some label it a right-wing publication, but for those who understand the libertarian philosophy, that is exactly where the publishers of this magazine fall within the political spectrum. But you don't have to be a libertarian to enjoy the magazine. If you are looking for a more sustainable and self reliant lifestyle, this is the magazine for you. There's not a lot of fluff here, each issue is a how-to guide, not a cursory examination of the topics at hand. It covers everything from gardening and preserving the harvest to building your own home, with articles on the infrastructure of your home such as electrical, plumbing and general handyman skills. There are also articles on a wide range of do-it-yourself topics that you won't find anywhere else. The authors all do what they write about, they aren't just guessing or talking about theory. And once you've subscribed and realize what a great value the magazine is, you'll probably want to order all of their back issues. They have 12 years worth of back issues available in an easy to read 8" 1/2 X 11" book format, or you can order them on CD in Adobe PDF format. You won't find this magazine on the newstand, the publishers realized that over half of all magazines on the newstand are thrown away unsold, and decided that it was a waste of money to pursue that sales channel 
I am an earthy-crunchy, organic, outdoorsy type and I love simple, natural things. [Yes, I shave my legs! I'm not that bad! Pfft.] Anyway, this is probably one of my favorite magazines of all time. It isn't for everyone, I will grant you that, but if you're into your home and land it is terrific. Seriously, this magazine has a little bit of everything for everyone....its subtitle is "practical ideas for self-reliant living". Don't you think we can all use a little of that? It would be nice if we could not be so reliant on other countries and their oil....couldn't we go on and on about that one? For instance, the newest issue touches on the following subjects: Panning for gold, making sausage, solar batteries, funerals don't have to be expensive, how to cook black bear [yes, really], the benefits of mulching, build a water component system, the Marlin 336 firearm, put your garden to bed for the winter, Kinder goats: a small breed for milk and meat. The magazine is educational, wholesome, down-to-earth, and very family-oriented. I subscribed last year. When it arrives in the mail I practically start jumping up and down, then run in the house and stash it in my briefcase so I can devote the "perfect" time to read it. It really is great. In fact, I just resubscribed and I did so for 5 more years. I can't wait to see what Mr. Duffy and his crew in Oregon pump out over that time frame. I'm sure they will send you a sample issue if you call and ask them for it: 800-835-2418 
As a Mother Earth News reader since the 70s I've become more and more dissatisfied with the 'slick' and corporate feel of the latest incarnation of TMEN. Then I found BACKWOODS HOME MAGAZINE and read every issue cover to cover. It gives me the type of substance of the old TMEN, but with a different ideological bent. Though I almost never agree with John Silvera he does a very important thing; he makes me think about the issues in a whole new light. The best John Silvera columns are when I do not agree with him, but reconsider old worn ideas I might have held as dear to my heart. Thank You John. Dealing with Dave Duffy and his whole team has been a pure pleasure. I've order many of the anthologies (back years in single copy form) and have been very pleased with the rapid shipping and care they take with each order. If you're even thinking of moving to a more rural lifestyle this is the magazine for you and you should order it today 
Over the years I've read and subscribed to many different magazines about a simpler life and sustainable living. And this is by far the best I've read. It's what others have started off as but then gotten commercialized. This magazine truly gives a wealth of information. It has a little bit for everyone. Give it a try and I'm sure you'll love it. As for the reviewer that had problems with the subscription service, that was not my experience. I first started with a trial issue and then a subscription from there and have never missed an issue. When I've called to renew my subscriptions or order books I've always had a very pleasan experience with the staff and very prompt service and shipping 
Have subscribed to mother earth news, countryside, and the now defunct american survival guide, to name a few. This magazine is the best by far. This magazine is written by people that not only believe in self-reliant living but who live it as well. It is written from their experiences that give credability to the articles found within the magazine 
Adventure, trips, and arcticles of people who have gone to the far reaches physically on this globe! Whether to travel into Afghanistan, or Budapest this is a great magazine to have if you love to travel, and explore! 
I am not a magazine reader at all. Adventure is the only magazine I have a subscription to (going on my 3rd year). It has great photography, travel journals, spotlights on different place to visit (i.e. South Africa). It also is fantastic if you are an avid outdoorsman/woman. The cover a lot camping, rafting, kayaking, etc. Well written, informative, great pictures. Always finding new places to write about. Good read every month - and CHEAP 
I don't know what the person was thinking who reviewed this magazine (Jan 2004) and said he had cancelled his subscription of 15 years. This magazine only first began publication a few years ago. I have every issue and have loved and read every one. Adventure is the best of the National Geographic publications and is for those who are young or at least young at heart. Some of the articles are a bit sassy -- but just enough to make them fun 
Biking, skiing, running, canoeing, hiking, kayaking: you name it it has you covered. Great tips and ideas for your first or next adventure vacation to any corner of the globe. If you are serious about or seriously considering getting out of the house and living life, this magazine is a must read! All this and a great price too 
This is probably one of the best magazines that you can subscribe to if you love any or all of the following: traveling, adventure, the outdoors, travel journals, great pictures of fantastic scenery or reading about any of the above. I have subscribed to this magazine for a while and there's never an issue that arrives in my mailbox in which I don't find at least one full article and two shorter articles that are enjoyable to read as well as informative. This magazine has inspired me to be even more adventurous on my next journey, whether it be domestic or international. But until, then, I can enjoy exciting travels vicariously through the authors of this publication. Kudos to National Geographic for really filling a void that "Outside" or "Backpacker" seem to leave 
I travel vicariously through National Geographic Adventure. A great magazine to sit, read and dream of an adventure 
My Wife loves reading this magazine, and reads it cover to cover as soon as it arrives. She is so happy to use the ideas in the magazine, and she converses with her friends about all the interesting stories 
I love this mag! Honest and appropriately opinionated product reviews. Great bike tests and incredibly helpful and practical "your questions answered" section. Anglocentric cyclists rejoice because the UK routes they cover (3 or 4 per issue) will have you searching for cheap airfares. Yes, it's expensive but mainly due to the horrible exchange rate. In the UK it sells for 3-4 pounds. Here on newstands it's about nine bucks. That's just the way it is! Much, much better than any U.S. publication. Check out their sister mag Pro Cycling for hard core racing fans. Both worth every cent 
What first may appear as a pricey subscription, is well worth the dollars. They ship this British magazine so well, it always shows up in perfect condition. This publication covers everything about cycling; not just racing, but touring, commuting, equipment, accessories, technique and nutrition and health aspects of riding more comfortably and succesfully, no matter what your level of fitness currently is. The hassles that the Brits deal with concerning traffic, local and national laws, and how the country and culture is resolving commuters taking their bikes on trains are also included each month. It provides a fascinating look at European views and even includes detailed maps and route descriptions, should you ever hope to make it over there to ride. Great publication 
Yes, this magazine is very expensive. However, it is the only English-language magazine that covers recreational road cycling very well. All of the articles are detailed and well written and most are of interest to readers outside of England. You can get the best price for USA subscriptions by ordering directly from the CyclingPlus web site 
I bought Ask for my 8 year old son. I think I am as excited as he is when a new one arrives. It is very educational and brings out a little explorer in all of us. You will be so glad you bought Ask. They don't teach this stuff in school. My son wants to be a scientist when he grows up, now 
Ask is an informative, high quality magazine for children that engages them as readers and learners. Since each issue is devoted to a particular theme, my students gain indepth information about a variety of topics. They are fascinated by the attractive format -- which includes wonderful photographs, illustrations, and graphic aids that are appropriate for young readers. My students have eagerly written letters to the editor and entered the bi-monthly contests. I highly recommend Ask as an excellent magazine for school libraries, classrooms, and homes 
I started reading ASK after I had already suscribed to MUSE for less than a year. The information in ASK is just as challeging and exciting as magazines for older kids! I love the pictures, format, activities; even the font of it. Anyone who breathes, lives, and exists normally--read ASK 
This is, in my opinion the best magazine for motocross coverage on the newsstand. It has excellent photography, great rider coverage, new technology/performance information, and more content than most other magazines out there. I highly reccomend this magazine and it is the only motocross magazine I buy anymore 
Transworld Motocross and RacerX are the two best motocross magazines available 
This magazine always gets me fired up and ready to ride. I love the big colorful photos, and use the magazine as a way to stay updated on new gear and products. A good solid magazine that's worth the price 
A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years, writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry". I love cooking and own more than 500 cookbooks. I am very interested in both Italian food and culture. I thoroughly enjoy this magazine, but it is probably not for everyone. The target audience for this magazine is those that love Italy and Italian cooking. This is a not a quick cook magazine. As with much of Italian cooking the recipes can be time as time consuming, as they are delicious. The July 2006 issue contained the following information: DEPARTMENTS Salute: Italian Cooking Notes from the publisher Tastes of Italia: The first courses n this month's Italian Adventure At the Market: Your Source for Italian Services and Products Recipe Index FEATURES Inside Italy: Perfect Picnic in Pienza Guest Chef: Giulian Hazen Books: Mario Batali tailgates Regional: Lunch in Bari The Road to Amalfi: Art, Architecture and Cuisine Summer Sunday: Leisurely meals with salads, pasta and tuna Easy Summer Pasta: Quick Fix Dishes Fresh Fruit Tarts: Desserts with peaches, plums and berries Mangiamo: Balsamic Vinegar with salads, meats, and ice cream There are 34 recipes provided in this issue of the magazine. They range from Dessert to Meat and Poultry, Panini, Pasta, Salad, Sauces, Seafood, Soup and Vegetables. My personal favorite recipe from this issue is the Red Pepper halves stuffed with Pine Nuts and Raisins. One of the things I like about this magazine is that the recipes titles are given both in English and Italian. I also find the directions for the recipes to be extremely detailed and easy follow for both the beginner and seasoned cooks. I also like that the recipes are authentic Italian, and not the usual Italian American. On the down side the magazine is a little short. The total length of this periodical is 82 pages including advertising. However, what is included is so well done compared to the typical food and travel magazine that I don't consider this a big downside. Overall I would recommend this magazine to those home cooks that love Italy and Italian food. I would suggest that you find a copy on the newsstand before subscribing, just to be certain that it is something that you will enjoy. 
This is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures. They are usually seasonal meaning 4-6 issues a year. This particular magazine is mostly black white pictures. At least the issues I've bought were. This is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut. A majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above. This is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait 
Great equipment reviews. Good swing tips. Only golf mag that tends to focus on equipment 
I have purchased 15 versions of the Australian magazine, and 2 of the new American version. Very impressed by the Australian one and very disappointed by the new American one. If you have the money for the Australian version it is worth every penny. A great magazine that is fresh and different and makes you almost feel like you live in Australia. It is very fun to get a Christmas issue where they are celebrating at the beach, being in the southern hemisphere. There are plenty of food magazines in the US. Splurge on the Australian one, it is wonderful ! ! 
Great Magazine! First Magazine that I have seen where it's only about the FOOD! They have a great list of ingredients and their conversions with measurements on last page for readers outside of Australia. It is very helpful for me since I am in the U.S. I agree, I wish it was not so expensive, but it is really a great alternative for other foodies out there, to see what else is going on in the world of cooking other than in America. 
This is one of the best food magazines anywhere, and comes from Australia. Some insight into the modern australian food and lifestyle, as well as great photos. I have made lots of things from it that always work out well and are often quite innovative without being overly tricky. Has celebrity chef's recipes (Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson, Jull Duplex) as well as unknowns. I get my mother to send me old issues from Australia. I don't know why it's so expensive here, but if you are looking for a gift for a homesick Australian who is into food: this is it! 
I think this magazine is totally hot, I luv the postas 2! It has cool articles and GR8 emberrasing moments, but a little 2 much mean gossip about celebs and it could be a little longer 
It's very easy to write off Popular Woodworking without even reading it. One tends to assume that it is going to be the Readers Digest of woodworking. One imagines countless overly simplified articles on how to build bookcases or select the right shop vacuum. Actually, this couldn't be further from the truth. Admittedly, Popular Woodworking is not a high-end magazine. It is for the moderately funded woodworker who wants to get the best out of his or her tools without a huge outlay. It's also for folks who like a wide coverage of the woodworking field. Plans, tools, jigs, wood, techniques, and workshops. In going through a recent issue repeatedly, I kept finding little articles that I have missed on earlier readings. This is a compliment to the editors in that they try to answer many needs. On the other hand, it indicates that magazine layout and structure is a bit haphazard and cramped. You just have to keep perusing it until everything sinks in. Take the time to do so and I think you will agree the Popular Woodworking is worthwhile reading 
This magazine surprises me. It looks like just another mass media pulp magazine, but it's really solid on the inside. These guys actually go to the shop and do woodworking. They are enthusiastic, thorough, honest, and funny. The articles seem to aim toward the moderately experienced amateur, but there's plenty of stuff for beginners. And the price can't be beat. This and Fine Woodworking are my favorites - put them together and you have everything you need 
I've collected this magazine for many years. the content is excellant with many projects for many different levels of experience. I also liked seeing how women of Europe and the U.K. decorate their homes during the different seasons and holidays. Anna magazine is deliteful for both the seasoned needlewoman or the absolute beginer. It is just so much fun 
Anna has an assortment patterns for knitting, crochet, cross-stitch, embroidery, and other crafts, mostly needlework, every month, and the design quality is generally higher than that in American magazines, which currently place a ridiculous emphasis on Easy, at the expense of design. There are usually some seasonal crafty-crafts included, using paper, paint, etc., for decorating and some purposes which are mysterious to this American reader. (Just what is a school cone, anyway?) Overall, a very worthwhile magazine, with a lot of truly beautiful patterns. I knitted one tablecloth pattern for my daughter's wedding veil, and it got raves. Well worth the price 
This is a brilliant magazine! I cannot stress enough just how helpful and user friendly this magazine is, with step-by-step tutorials, Q section, book and programme recommendations and beautiful art show casings. It covers a little bit of everything and comes with a DVD containing Demo's, art tutorials, Photo's and fonts and more. It's a magazine written for artists by artists and as a result I found my work improving greatly just from reading and practicing the tutorials in this magazine 
Creative Knitting is relatively new to the knitting market, a welcome addition. While I haven't subscribed yet, I pick up copies at the newstand and have generally found the quality of the patterns, styles, and articles to be pretty good. The directions for the garments that I've made have been accurate and error free. Except for things like bikinis (who at any age would wear a hand-knitted bikini?) and slacks (?!), most of the designs are modern and adaptable. With 20 or more projects in each issue, CK is a bargain. Hope these editors and designers keep up the good work 
I read both Golf Golf Digest for years [I should practice play more and read less about golf...] :-) But, in recent years, Golf Digest has strayed far from what I want in a golf magazine - three examples: GD put in a fashion column [nobody I golf with has ever discussed golf clothing or styles!]; GD added a smarmy gossip column [trying to compete with the tabloids?]; GD no longer objectively reviews golf equipment [they now offer a "hot list" which amazingly enough coincides with their big advertisers]. Golf magazine has avoided these stupidities PLUS it has the spice of David Feherty's column - despite the fact that it was cut in half a couple years back. Golf is now clearly superior to Golf Digest. 
This magazine has good articles about golf and on golf instruction. The pictures on golf instruction are always very clear and not hard to follow. I think there are too many ads at times which I sometimes get tired of reading... I recommend the following books on golf instruction that I found to be highly beneficial. The first one is "Zen Golf", which shows the mental side of the game and makes playing golf easier in this aspect. The second book I recommend on the physical aspect of golf is "The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better." This book really has some amazing and unique stuff about the golf swing. I finally scored below 80 because of this book. Golf Magazine is definitely my favorite magazine on golf. I also love their issue every year on new golf equipment. This issue I find the best. It shows you how golfers with different handicaps perform with different clubs. It even shows clubhead speeds and measured driving distance of each person who is testing the clubs. I find this very interesting. 
I think this is a good review. If you are into golf you should deffenitly read this. If you are not so sure if you want to play golf maybe you should read this and get more into this magazine. This is more for teenagers and up I don't think kids would get this very much. My dad went crazy over this magazine and made me read this magazine and it made me get more into golf. I think if you would like to be more into golf and learn more about the players and the sport you should diffently read this. I think this was a great way for you to get more into golf and maybe just maybe you will be a pro someday 
GOLF DIGEST is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications. It's self-styled tag line--'The #1 Golf Publication'--is well-earned. Where other weeklies report the golfing *news*, GOLF DIGEST is a monthly celebration of golf as life, or at least of the golfing life. It's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ('Don't Stretch Your Wedges'), giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers. Even those of us who are less than bent on links glory, the photography of this publication looks extraordinary. This aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world. No doubt about it, GOLF DIGEST is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else. Yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game. GOLF DIGEST anchors the world of English-language golfing publications. Even better, you can frequently pick it up for the price of a few frequent flyer miles 
This came promptly and is a "joy " to read. It is very informative for all types of golfers, women and men,low and high handicappers 
I've had a subscription to this mag for years. Great stories and the photos are top of the line. While it was a much better pub when the NY Times owned it (the people who worked there actually golfed), since Conde has bought it, it's gone downhill a bit. Still, it's hard to kill a great sport 
Over the many years that I have subscribed to Golf Digest, I've come across extremely useful information from world class teachers and the top players that has improved my game. In addition to appreciating the superb teaching article, I always look forward to the new product editions. Equally informative and entertaining are the various feature article and interviews. Golf Digest is simply the best golf magazine 
A must for all motorcyclists and anyone who watches the "V-TWIN" TV series. 
A great magazine with travel, food and gardening advice and commentary devoted to the western United States. Inexpensive, unpretentious, quality 
This magazine is lovely. It has beautiful pictures and great recipes. There is not one recipe that I have tried from this magazine that has not turned out great. The best part about the recipes is that it is usually fresh foods that are in season and are not difficult to find. It touches on home decorating and despite the name and despite being directed towards southwest living it is not the type of home deco you might expect. It is classic, stylish and modern decorating. There are travel ideas and it is usually something the whole family can afford. They are usually a little bit off the beaten path and feature something quirky, fun or plain interesting. Well worth the money. Enjoy. 
I've always thought of Sunset magazine as the type of magazine you'd find in the back of an airplane seat. The kind of magazine with flashy pictures, expensive wines and places you can never afford to go to. This is a good magazine, but I find level of advertising annoying. Also, the reviews of hotels don't strike me as that reliable. Last month, based on a review in this magazine about an inn, we stayed the night at this location and found the service was awful, the 'rooms with fireplaces' not functional and the room smelled bad. These facts were conveniently left out of the review which touted the friendly staff and the great rooms. So I guess, ultimately, I'd take reviews and articles in the magazine with a grain of salt. I DO however like the recipes, particularly the ones which come out around harvest/Thanksgiving time. 4 stars 
I enjoy looking at and reading the articles in "Sunset". We plan to retire in Montana and I save articles that have information on houses, yards, etc. Someday, we hope to use some of this information. Great, healthy recipes also included in the magazine 
Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more. I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture. One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc. One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook. One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the "Value Vacation"- a subsection of Travel Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel. Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food. Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West. 
Sunset is like a western states version of Saveur. Travel, recipes, interesting events... Plus some really good gardening and decorating articles. Its not preachy or pretentious, always informative and a joy to find in the mailbox. Its also printed on paper that is easy to turn pages and read along as opposed to other magazines with a huge number of cardboard and foldout ads and static-y paper. It jumps around a lot less than some magazines too. I read somewhere that they just had a big layoff and reorg, but the magazine is still as good as ever as far as I can tell 
I'm a California author and culinary historian of "CALIFORNIA PIONEERS", their stories, culutre and cuisine. Naturally, with a credit like that, I read the California/West Coast edition of SUNSET magazine. Here's what I like about it: 1. Articles about California history and culture are always well researched...as a California historian, I am very particular about this aspect. 2. The travel stories and section are the best: they offer the touristy side aa well as the lesser-known aspects. 3. Excellent advice on gardening (flowers, fruit and vegetables) relative to the actual climate where people live. 4. Food/Recipes section often offers ideas and recipes for doing something new with common ingredients, especially seasonal ingredients. There are other features that represent a variety of interests: Entertainment outings, conservation issues and just about any thing else making the news on the West Coast. It is a good all around lifestyle magazine 
I have been buying biker magazines for over 30 years. I have bought Easyriders, Biker Lifestyle, and Biker. I have even bought the regular motorcycle magazines such as American Motorcycle and Iron Horse but they don't measure up to Biker. I enjoy the articles and the pictures from the different events they go to. I use to go to any newsstand and be able to buy bike magazines but not anymore. It is getting harder and harder for me to find these type of magazines over the counter (with or without a plastic cover). Why have they quit having them in newstands? Do they sell them any place else? I can find old editions at some of the local flea markets at the biker apparel shops and the bike stores such as Harley Davidson. Anyway, I still love reading the Biker magazine and will continue to do so until they stop publishing it. Keep up the good work, guys!!! Your friend, Deb M 
I love this magazine...it has everything that I'm into: The styles, the looks, the makeup, the celebs and more.. Great magazine..it's worth the money! 
I chose to subscribe to this mag over Men's Health. My reasons are simple- though both offer same interesting articles of interest to men, Best Life has less of the "Racy/Edgy" content that a 30 Something Father of 4 may not be comfortable reading or leaving around the house for curious eyes to see. It seemed geared more toward my Demographic , as opposed to Mens Health that seemed more geared to a Single Bachelor living "La Vida Loca". One thing I prefered Mens Health on was the plethora of health/nutrition info in each issue. This is one area they excel in providing a wealth of nutrition info with many recipes to complement a healthy lifestyle. Best Life also has nutrition info but nowhere near as much. My decision is based on a couple of issues of evaluation. Hoping they stand up in the months to come. 
It is obvious that the target audience for this magazine is the well-heeled, style-conscious white collar worker going by the adverts and article focus 
This is one of the best magazines out there. The articles and advice are good. I really enjoy the jokes and the 10 Things You Don't Know About Women features every month. 
Running Times is one of two running magazines we subscribe to. It offers some valuable and well tested advise for the novice and well as the seasoned runner, on diet and injury prevention and care after the fact. I recommend it to anyone seriously interested in running 
I have been searching for a good magazine for my kids, and this is by far the best I have seen. The articles are in depth, and the pictures and photos are very high quality. Best of all - there is no ads to confuse your kids!! Since I read so many bad billing reviews about this magazine, I decided to get it from my local library. Again, this is a GREAT magazine you don't want your kids to miss! 
It is unfortunate that so many customers have had bad experience with the billing of this magazine, because it is a truly wonderful product. Each issue is an in-depth exploration of a single topic, so kids can really learn a lot. It's a nice change from other kids magazines that have a "sound byte" approach to information. I do have to agree that the inability to call the magazine is a pain...we had to change our address at one point, and could only submit a written request. Their customer service needs to be more accessible if they want to attract and keep their readers. 
Our child enjoys, and we enjoy approve of both National Geographic Kids and Discover Kids. They're so fascinating to read (especially Discover Kids), that the kids forget that they're being educated! HOWEVER...Like the review entitled "Billing Fraud" submitted by Mr. Hunter, I will testify to National Geographic Kids shameless sales tactics...also addressed specifically to our minor child. I fully believe Mr. Hunter's entire report, as we've experienced similar shameless marketing practices from National Geographic Kids. Go to the website. Ask the Customer Service Rep for the name mailing address of the President CEO of "The Society". Don't bother with any attempt at discussion, they have canned replies that just go in circles without addressing the immorality and questionable legality of marketing to minors without parental consent. Also ask for the Board of Directors contact info. Write a letter to the CEO, and CC each member of the Board, telling him what you think of their unethical, immoral sales practices which violate our children's privacy and undermine our parental authority to monitor, guide, and supervise our children's exposure to the media, thereby undermining our parental abilities to protect our children. They claim they don't know whether a name address on a subscription is a child or an adult. They refuse to admit any responsibility to make that determination...they just shamelessly market their publications addressed directly (in the mail) to minors. Their staff, management, Board of Directors, and stockholders should be ASHAMED of themselves! Our child enjoys, and we approve of, National Geographic Kids (and Discover Kids) itself...we're appalled by the "subscription" (ie. "sales") practices. Again, our child enjoys, and we approve of both National Geographic Kids and Discover Kids. 
Several times in the past I've almost completely given up on Motor Trend. I even canceled my subscription on two occasions. My main gripe during those times? Too darned many trucks and SUVs. Sure, that's what the U.S. public seems to want, and "Trend" does appear in the name, but boooooring. When they released Truck Trend as a sister publication, I danced for joy and then fell flat on my face when MT seemed to STILL spend 2/3 of every issue on hulking boringmobiles. In recent months Motor Trend has come full circle and again seems to be focusing on interesting articles about cars. Trucks and SUVs are hardly missing, but in that respect and others MT is tremendously better than it was, say, two years ago. The transformation is nearly astounding. I can still remember the first time I closed the back flap of the latest issue and suddenly thought "Holy smokes, that was GOOD!" Now definitely worth reading again 
Wow! Motor Trend went from the dog of the industry to the darling. The layout and format are excellently conceived and the photography is bar none the best in the industry. It still lacks the technical prowess of Road Track or the comprehensiveness of Car Driver. However, it has become a must read 
This magazine is the best. I'm always eager to get it and keep up with the reviews and articles. I've been a loyal subscriber for over 30 years 
This was gift for my grandson. He liked it last year and requested another year of the magazine 
This magazine is often said to be intended for graphic design newbies. While it is true that if you are inexperienced to graphic design principles and software, this is the magazine for you --it is also true that pros can get a lot of useful ideas from Dynamic Graphics. As an experienced designer, it sometimes helps me to re-visit basic techniques, color use, schemes and read reviews of new design software just hitting the market (they aren't ALL good). Even graphics pros get 'design blocked' from time-to-time. I get something useful out of every issue, and the free downloadable stuff on DG's website is a nice treat too 
A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years, writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry". I love cooking and own more than 500 cookbooks. I am very interested in both Italian food and culture. I thoroughly enjoy this magazine, but it is probably not for everyone. The target audience for this magazine is those that love Italy and Italian cooking. This is a not a quick cook magazine. As with much of Italian cooking the recipes can be time as time consuming, as they are delicious. However, if you have time to prepare the recipes this is a great magazine. The August 2006 issue contained the following information: Tidbits: Jump-start your summer with Sardinian products and a must-have health read Bacco: Italian Wine of the Month club Wine News: Regional Wine tasting tour Style: Coastal Themed entertaining ware Special Occasion: Italian Style 4th of July Picnic A Tavola: .....Antipasti .....First Course .....Fish and Seafood .....Meat and Poultry .....Vegetables .....Dessert .....Quick and Easy Close Up: Apricots Cooking School: Fruit Sweet and Savory: Antipasti Cocktail: Rosemary Lemonade Courses at the Italian Cooking Institute in NYC My Tuscany Glossary Recipe Index Cellar Notes There are 55 recipes provided in this issue of the magazine. The recipes cover everything from Antipasti through Dessert. One of the things I like about this magazine is that the recipes titles are given both in English and Italian. I also find the directions for the recipes to be extremely detailed and easy follow for both the beginner and seasoned cooks. I also like that the recipes are authentic Italian, and not the usual Italian American. Most of the recipes have a beautiful photograph of the dish provided. The magazine is a reasonable length. The total length of this periodical is 98 pages including advertising. There are many advertisements in this periodical. However, as someone that is always looking for new sources of Italian products I don't consider that to be a problem. Overall I would recommend this magazine to those home cooks that love Italy and Italian food. I would suggest that you find a copy on the newsstand before subscribing, just to be certain that it is something that you will enjoy. If you are like me, a devoted Italiaphile that loves to cook, this is the magazine for you. I have been reading this magazine for almost 10 years and it just keeps getting better 
Since returning from a Tuscan holiday in summer of 2001, I could not get enough "authentic" Italian food to satisfy my now-wiser palate. Enter La Cucina Italiana (and its sister publication, Italian Cooking and Living) to assist me in recreating so many foods I experienced over there. I have never found an issue wanting in content and diversity, and of late the format has been much improved with rich photography and more adventurous dishes, and in a sturdier wrapper for keeping. I did discover quickly that a clear acrylic cookbook stand is essential to keep my copies from getting sauced upon or otherwise soiled. If you're planning to give this as a gift, make sure you order a subscription for yourself as well! But it makes a most welcome gift that lasts all year and then some : 
After returning from Italy, I found I had fallen in love with the country and its cuisine. I started subscribing to La Cucina Italiana to feed my habit. The magazine is full of wonderful recipes, lifestyle and travel tips that make you feel as though you are there--or wish you were. Each issue features appetizer, first, second and dessert course recipes, as well as a special "Rapido e Simplice" section--fast easy recipes for casual or everyday meals. While some of the recipes may call for ingredients not easy to find outside major metropolitan areas, the advertising offers many online and mail order resources. There is even a listing of Italian restaurants and grocers across the US! Printed on high-quality, glossy stock, each issue is coffee table worthy. I only wish I lived in NYC so I could take advantage of the Institute's many course offerings and social events! If you love Italian cooking, and crave authenticity, subscribe to La Cucina--you will love it 
This is the best car magazine in the universe for all you gear heads out there. As the name implies, it is strictly about hot rods: big blocks, big tires, big smoke--you get the picture. You can learn how to get rid of the rust on your car and find the best place to get parts for your '69 Sting Ray and find out about the new Z06's. I am car-tarded, my husband is the mechanic. He runs an auto shop and he actually refers to this magazine in his line of work. However, I've actually *learned* something from this magazine and I can actually talk shop with the boys! It's a great entertainment and learning tool regardless of the reason why you read it--to learn about the brand new Camaro coming out and different car reviews. BUY THIS MAGAZINE!! 
This self-described 'Handbook of the American Entrepeneur' is one fine piece of work. I read it cover to cover upon arrival. INC. is the kind of practical brain food with just the right touch of attitude that keeps ideas spinning and feeds the pragmatic lobe of the brain with excellent practical tips. When compared to FAST COMPANY, its main competitor, INC. is the more conventional entrepeneur's read. It is to the entrepeneur what MONEY magazine is to the personal investor. When you run your own company, you get a little uppity. Everybody who wastes your time is stealing your money. Every vacuous pontification robs your time. INC. communicates that kind of I'm-responsible-for-this-gig-so-don't-waste-my-time attitude without posing. Some great editing makes for innovative article selection, like the October 2006 ranking of state governor's according to what they've done for the entrepeneurial climate in their realm. Don't think twice. Go for INC 
If you have your own small business or start-up, or are even slightly thinking about starting one, this magazine is well worth the small cost. I usually bring mine on the plane along with a couple others 
I ordered a free trial of this mag a while back, before starting my own e-business recently. Immediately I began a subscription. The reviews from pros on REAL businesses offer a lot of insight while the profiles give it a real world feel. I would recommend this to anyone even considering working in the high ranks of any business. Keeps you informed and in touch. 
I subscribe to Inc.. Although I am not a business owner, yet, I find the articles to be informative and the magazine a useful resource. As an accomplished song writer and aspiring song seller, the article on (...)-May 2005- made me aware of a resource that I did know was available. Check that one out. With Joe Mansueto, CEO of Morningstar and self-confessed fan of Inc., acquiring the magazine I can only imagine the great things ahead. The full-page N.Y. Times ad reinforces Mansueto's commitment to growing the brand. Can't wait for future issues 
Inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity. With Inc., you get timely advice on taxes, marketing, financing, and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day. Probably the strongest point of Inc. is the way it presents important information to readers. The authors of this magazine get directly to the point. They don't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact. Even when the news is bad, like with regulations, taxation, etc., Inc. lets you have it in a direct manner. This is good, because I get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts. Inc. writers are direct, and I respect them for that. If there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine, I can think of only two: The lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that, while nice to read about, present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners. Inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth. This is fine, but I would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground. And, every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich. Again, this is ok, but I would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic. Still, Inc. is a very good publication for small business owners. It provides some good, timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns. The price to subscribe is low, too, making Inc. magazine a must for owners of small, growing companies. 
I have been a subscriber to Inc. for several years. It is one of the few magazines that discusses the personalities, struggles, successes and failures of businesses of many sizes. It's a key resource for anyone considering starting their own business, working in a family or other small business. The writing is top notch, the subjects intelligent. A breeze to read 
I believe there is an error in the answer for puzzle #43 in the July 2005 puzzle book. The logic given for the Cont. Congress print does not match clue #4. I believe the dates given for the Cont. Congress and for Paul Revere should be reversed. (C.C. should be 1868 and P.R. 1856) Other than that, I am having a ball with the puzzles, and it keeps my gray matter from atrophying 
This magazine is the best LOGIC Magazine ever! It has logic problems that make you think more than you think you can 
I discovered this publication by chance at a Borders when I was looking for something to kill time with. The adds are interesting. There are lots of them. For people who prefer to look at the pictures (like me) this is the publication to have. There are lots of adds, it's a fairly hefty book and is worth the money for the subscription. As a photographer I find the images interesting, creative and very cutting edge. The adds cover everything from photography to digital manipulation to drawings. I highly recommend this publication 
Different people buy this for different reasons. I buy it for the great photography that actually ends up in client's hands. Really good stuff. Even though it is international, much of it is generic and the text is English. Nice large format, printed very well, with line cuts near the binding reminding you that you can cut the pages out and use them for reference. Good for the professional and the hobbyist. Pick up a copy and consider a subscription. Good stuff 
The magazine serves much to me for my work, I am Art director in a Advertising agency. The only thing that I must say is that I have been paying for two months and not yet it arrives the magazine, thats all folks 
This is by far my favorite magazine. Most other magazines dealing with graphic design and related fields are mostly ads for printers, paper, stock photography and very little content and maybe a few articles here or there. luerzers archive is all meat. I get to see the hotest work from around the world. I can always count on luerzers archive for inspiration and to keep me grounded when school tries to throw their biased cookie cutter crap at me 
The magazine that really show the trends in creative print ads worldwide. This German magazine is probably one of the most honest predictors of award shows' outcome (Cannes Festival 2002 grand prix appeared in this mag months before). If you are in the advertising business in the creative or planning areas, or if you are just interested in what is happening in this business around the world, Archive is the best source of information 
Backhome is published in the same town in NC that the original Mother Earth News was, uses some of the same authors and artists, and has the same friendly, practical, folksy feel that you've been looking for ever since. Filled with information for young and old, rich and poor, city or country (but especially country), Backhome is a good magazine from good people for the good life. You'll enjoy garden-fresh recipes, tons of how-to articles for the homestead, information on animals and herbs, reusing and making do, and humor to make the true back-to-the-lander smile and nod. If you enjoyed the classic Mother Earth News, come Backhome again 
I have subscribed to this magazine for the last year. There are good quality photos, hand &amp; machine knitting instructions, and schematics for every pattern. However, instructions are sometimes on the same page, a few pages later, or in the back of the magazine--not consistent and sometimes challenging to find. It would be nice if the editor would have these in a consistent location 
For anyone who wants to live a healthier, more responsible lifestyle this site is for you! I've always lived "green" but in retrospect feel my life before The Green Guide was one of ignorance. It offers great resources on green companies, helpful information on what to look for and an endless supply of tips. I can even ask my own questions and receive detailed informative answers to unique issues. Share this one with friends 
I love this magazine! The articles are so helpful and informative. I've purchased so many of the products they recommend and they are great 
An excellent source on environmental issues, healthier living, and green products. I like to cook and use it frequently for information aboout organic produce, meat and uncontaminated fish 
I felt compelled to write a short note after receiving a renewal notification too early. I first ordered the Journal in June 05, I received a renewal that I thought was in order in March 06, now I'm getting another one in Dec 06. It seems Amazon is engaging in some behavior that takes several months of subscription time away from consumers who order through them. Be carefu 
Woodworkers Journal has attracted some of my favorite woodworking experts from the other magazines. Michael Dresdner, Ellis Wallentine, Shondor Nagaslaski are all great tool and woodworking experts and give me the information that I need to advance my skills and keep working in the shop interesting. I can hardly wait for the next issue to arrive. It will have shop tips, jigs, finishing tips and projects. No other magazine has this well rounded approach to woodworking 
Can you please send me a bunch of pics of up-do hairstyles for a formal party. Thanks 
I love to read this magazine A lot 
I love this magazine and usually seek it out at a magazine store that is 30 minute drive from my house *laugh* Great articles and scientific facts on a very large diverse variety of birds 
This magazine delivers the most bang for your buck. It is very informative 
I cannot say enough good things about Runners World. It is a wonderful magazine, the staff of which works hard to make this magazine accessible to all runners - regardless of the level. While many hobbiest or sport magazines first appear intimidating to a novice in the field, this magazine strives to include even beginners in the audience of its articles. Another nice characterstic of this magazine is the race calendar in every issue that highlights some of the larger road races across the country. The feature stories are also wonderful. As one who has run for a very long time, I can attest to the value of this subscription. I will certainly be renewing this subscription for a very long time 
I like Runners World Magazine, it has a lot of helpful tips encouraging articles 
well rounded and interesting magazine. full of tips and articles for serious runners, amateurs and even couch potatoes. definitely worth the read 
Love all the covers. The information is informative for even beginner runners like myself. And especially with all the info they have on injuries and how to "get around them". Having had knee surgery at a young age I often experience pain when it is cold or I put a lot of strain on it. They offered really good advice as far as ice bathes and diffrent salves that would help.. and the DID! 
I am a newby to the sport of running and I use this magazine as my inspiration. I read it from cover to cover as soon as I get it. I look forward to each and every issue, leaving them torn and tatered days later. I do not know if I will enjoy them the same way as seasoned runner, but I cant wait to see! 
I've been buying Runner's World off and on for years and everytime I pick up a copy, I never feel warded off the sport. I'm trying to train for a triathlon and everytime I pick up a magazine relating to triathlons in general, I feel like I'm the laziest ass on the planet. I'm not going to not do one because of this but it doesn't really help motivate a beginner. I love Runner's World because it's all-inclusive, for any level, for any age. I don't get that daunting feeling I get when I pick up a tri mag and I think for anyone who needs that reassurance on a constant basis, RW really helps out. 
My brother in law is a pilot, this 1 year subscription is under 12 bucks for 1 year. How could I go wrong ??? 
Flying a plane is one of my frustrations, and Flight Simulator is as close as I can get to real flying. However, this magazine puts me in touch with what goes on out there, and it makes me feel like one of the lucky few who can actually own/fly a plane. I've been reading Plane and Pilot since the mid 90s and I still anticipate the arrival of each new issue 
Okay... I can see why one would be upset with the higher-end fashions in TeenVogue... but it's not THAT big of a deal. This magazine, in my eyes, is actually very excellent-- the fashions are inspiring to both fashionistas and designers, and encourages a more unique look than the typical Hollister tee and skirt. The photography is excellent, and I find the articles rather interesting. Also, it doesn't include the racier subject matter as found in CosmoGirl, Seventeen, ect. If you enjoy cutting up magazines to make collages or hang full pages on your wall, this magazine is for you. That sounds derogatory, but what I'm trying to highlight here is the beautiful shoots and intriguing advertisements. This wonderful publication is recieving too much negative hype on this site, and if you appreciate fashion and photography, I suggest you check this magazine out at a drugstore, grocer... whatever. It's DEFINITELY worth the look. 
We gave this to my boyfriend's 12-yr-old niece (who has every imaginable tech toy someone could have!) for Christmas this year and it was the perfect gift! She's just coming into her own now and has lots of curiousity about make-up, clothes, accessories, etc. This mag helps her figure some of that stuff out on her own without the influence of her friends or worse yet, parents---yuck! It's so cute how excited she gets when her mag comes in the mail! She's like a mini-me of an adult getting their People 
This magazine is going to be really great once it gets more established. It seems some people have had problems with their subscriptions...I get mine at the store, so I cannot comment on that. I do know that ALL IN now has increased sales a lot in the past year, so they may be behind. As far as the magazine itself, the articles are very interesting and it appeals to those who want to read about the stars of poker. They did a thorough coverage of NBC's heads-up championship, without giving anything away. Every player was profiled, all 64 of them. It was awsome. BLUFF magazine, on the other hand, told who won the rounds and gave away the winner a month before it aired..I think that sucks. [...] I will not buy another BLUFF again for that reason...also, they are not even close to being as good as ALL IN. The only competition would be Card Player. Card Player is the best and if you want more serious poker talk, Card Player may be your magazine. With regular articles by Hellmuth and Negreanu...among others, it is the cream of the crop. For me, I enjoy reading about the stars of poker and the upcoming events, etc. In the last ALL IN, Antonio Esfandiari wrote an article about his nights at the club and the hotties they met. Phil Gordon wrote about his tournament with Michael Jordan. If you want fun and light poker reading, ALL In is the best. If you want strategic poker articles written by poker stars and complete tournament coverage, Card Player is your magazine. Bluff is a waste of money. I would only read BLUFF if someone gave it to me. Poker magazines only started hitting newstands in the last few years. Magazines like Card Player and ALL IN will get better and begin to restructure themselves to appeal to the general public. ALL IN is one of the magaines leading the way in presenting the poker world in an entetaining way. Hope this helped some of you. 
The articles are always well-written and very informative, but I love this magazine most of all because of the fabulous photographs that appear cover-to-cover. I frequently cut out the pics after finishing the issue and cover my office's cubicle walls with them -- the wonderful colors of the scenery and the fascinating close-ups of birds and other wildlife just leave me breathless! 
This magazine is not only informative but also entertaining. I am so happy I decided to subscribe. The price is inexpensive and for all you nature lovers, you must have this 
I don't know what distinguishes WILDBIRD from other periodicals about the subject, perhaps it is a `bird-of-the-month' approach, but I do find the articles and photographs, columns and "departments" interesting and informative. For example, the May/June issue of WB is promoted as the `15th Annual Hummingbird Issue' and includes a somewhat lengthy essay, "Beginner's Guide to Hummingbird ID by Sherri Williamson, co-founder of the SE Arizona Bird Observatory. Another article is entitled, "Hummingbird Helpers: How you can contribute to the study and aid of Hummingbirds". The latter is by Wildbird Advisory Board member Peter Strangel who coordinates bird conservation efforts for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in Atlanta, and who writes a recurring column for WB. A Hummingbird photo-essay by Ralph Paonessa is also included, as well as articles on backyard birds and birds in South America about - you guessed it - Hummingbirds. WB displays a keen interest in photography, sponsoring an annual photography contest and includes regular columns on conservation, as well as an `Ornithology 101', and other recurring useful topics. 
I liked the magazine because it stayed with the articles on the cover and more on different birds, from the habits, to locating birds, what they eat, nesting patterns, ect. My favorite part of the magazine was the Bird Jokes, Contests. Wonderful magazine with pictures for kids and adults, a treasure find for any bird lover. 
Having been an avid reader of ID magazine first, I was stunned to see a magazine like 'Wallpaper' that is more dedicated to the actual products than the industry. ID magazine just always left me wishing 1) there was more pictures of actual products and 2) I didn't just spend THAT much money on each issue. I loved Wallpaper. But then I was introduced to 'Surface'. Surface's features are more design-oriented. You get a sense that the editors hand-picked the products for their innovation, sculptural form, and the desire to expose the readers to designs ranging from fashion to architecture to product. It's more obvious that Surface goes to great lengths to make the whole issue cohesive; a general theme is carried from one article to the next. On the other hand, Wallpaper--while a very good addition to Surface--seems more like a monthly "collection" of interesting design products and buildings sent in by reporters around the globe. Wallpaper has its own advantages, however, and it's that it always strives to get things from around the world, not just Europe or the U.S. In fact, it features more Asian design than Surface does and has special issues like Wallpaper Navigator--sort of a guide to the design-minded world traveler. (You'd be surprised at the level of sophistication of current Asian design.) Nevertheless, each issue of Surface is simply more special, more professionally executed, and while I pick up Wallpaper all the time, Surface is the magazine I subscribe to. In the end, ID magazine is like a 'Guide to Downtown Eating' for professional industrial designers; Wallpaper is the "buffet" of the three with its product section, architecture section, and world section; Surface is, fittingly, the well DESIGNED three-course dinner with its appetizer, entree, and dessert all complementing each other. 
I'm not sure how many (25?)years I've been reading this magazine but it continues to be the "bible" of cycling enthusiasts. It is slanted more towards the road rider as opposed to the mountain biker but they do publish a partner magazine entitled Mountain Bike. I've had many on and off again subscriptions only to return to reading or fantasizing about the latest toys and people's adventures on bikes. This is the time to gear up! You may see the cyclosaurus out and about in their colorful spandex outfits, bronzed bodies in all shapes and sizes, grazing on a protein energy bar or sipping a carb loaded drink as they motor through traffic propelled by their own energy. Or you might see the cyclosaurus counterpart off road in a more trendy, lined baggy shorts and t-shirt, sipping from a hydration pak on their backs as they kick up dust barreling down an exhilirating single track. In any event this is the time of year when weekend warriors become Lance Armstrong or Dotsie Cowden. The magazine for the cyclosaurus is Bicycling because of it's informative tidbits of information that tells you where the best organized rides are, the latest product developments, training and nuitrition tips and the exciting outdoor adventures that can only be experienced on bike. One of the mainstay features are bike recommendations that can run the gamut from a cool $3-$5k to the more sensible priced deals at around $1,500. Whether you want to know about the latest road shoes available, bibs, shorts, helmets, tandems, tape, tires, cages, bottles, sunglasses, tools, timers or trainers, it is all here for the cyclosaurus. Recommended for bike riders everywhere, as Willie Nelson once sang, it just might get you back "on the road again. 
I've been very satisfied with Workbench Magazine. It has project plans, ideas, and tips for the home, workshop, and even the yard. From my personal dealings with their customer support department, the rest of the magazine world has a lot to learn about taking care of customers. If I could have only one home improvement magazine, Workbench would be my first choice 
Everything was fine, ordered in October and received my first issue in December. Even though I was warrened it would be this long or longer, I thought that was a little too long to wait! Why should it take that long? However, I was happy with the service, otherwise, and I like the book! 
I am unsure of what led me to start trying logic problems, but once I did I found them difficult to put down. Dell's Logic Puzzles is one of my favorites because it offers a range of logic problems from easy to nearly impossible (for me). I have spent days trying to solve some of the more difficult logic problems. In one rare case I went longer than a month. Logic problems are not for everyone. They can be frustrating, particularly the harder ones. I have found magazines with more difficult logic puzzles, and I have found some that have mostly easier puzzles, but I like a range and Dell's Logic Puzzles offers a very wide range. If you are looking for a brain workout at a cost effective price, here is a magazine for you. 
I've subscribed to Gourmet, Bon Appetite, even Taste Of Home. What I like about Donna Hay's magazine is that every recipe I liked had a wonderful photo (I'm very visual) and easy to follow directions. It's also not cluttered with a lot of "wine tasting in the valley" type of info or gourmet reviews of things I'll never cook. These mags are keepers and you could even mat/frame some of the photos for your kitchen wall. Remember though, the subscription is for 6 issues a year, not 12. Great gift for that cook you just are out of ideas for 
I just bought Issue #14 at the local book store and I am very impressed. The photographs are excellent. I assumed the recipes would be long with an exotic ingrediant list but I was pleasantly surprised at their simplicity and that most of the ingrediants were ones I had on hand. Best of all, everthing I've tried so far has tasted great. I did find their publishing schedule a bit confusing as I could not find a date in the magazine and the cover only stated Autumn. I liked it so well I went to a different book store and found Issue #13 as well as cookbooks by Donna Hay 
Communication Arts is great. It provides ideas, insight, and shows what's going on in the media world as we know it 
As a professional graphic designer and illustrator, I read a lot of the trade magazines, but Communication Arts is the only one I keep back copies of. I have had a subscription to this magazine since my art school days and I still look forward to receiving it in the mail. The magazine is beautifully designed with clean type and the feature articles are always interesting. It is well worth the cost of subscription. Just get it! You won't be sorry 
Don't be fooled by the pretty faces on the cover. This is one of the savviest newsmagazines around. Read it and love it for the crackling writing, the grown-up humor, and the inside story. Then treat yourself to the dish about the sins of the rich (who are usually NOT the people in the tabloids, but mysterious financiers who live offshore and have dark and shady pasts...) and a brief interview with the cover celeb. It's one of the best monthlies available. 
Vanity Fair is my favorite Magazine. I enjoy the editorial features as well as fashion, entertainment and so much more. It smells better than other piece of mail in my mailbox 
I don't remember when I first started reading Vanity Fair, but it was many years ago and I have continued to read this great publication, as well as save the issues for the longest time. I find it to be the most complete magazine for me and I'm always looking forward to the next issue. Thank you, Vanity Fair, and keep up the great work 
Ordered this magazine and received the very first issue much sooner than I expected. Has some charming patterns in it that are not often seen in the US. Thank 
Cheaper than the "discount" magazine spots. Received 1st issue within 2 weeks 
Came right away and in a timely fashion every two weeks! Great product for a wonderful price! Loved it 
I love SI, and Amazon offers great pricing. Of course this was a renewal (from Amazon) , and we are now receiving 2 copies until the original subscription runs out 
I bought this for my dad for Christmas this year and he loves the idea. Yes, it is taking a while for the first subscription to arrive, but they warned me it would be 6-8 weeks. With the money savings, I didn't mind waiting a bit for the first issue. They even mailed me a little gift certificate notification card to send to my dad 
One of the few magazines I will read cover to cover. Even those articles about civilian aircraft (I am a military aircraft enthusiast/author) I read with great interest. Many articles are about events/machines/people that I've never heard of but are fascinating to learn about. My only criticism is that it is not a monthly publication. It would be a great day indeed if the publishers decided to make it so. Either way, it is worth the money for a subscription 
I take several different magazines, of different types.This is the one that I invariably read cover to cover, every single issue. OK, so you have to be _interested_ in the specialized subject matter, first. But if you do have any interest at all in Aviation History, this magazine presents a seldom-failing insight into lost, little-known, and obscure aspects of the entire century of aviation. The writing is literate and interesting, and they come up with some marvellous, mostly unpublished, pictures. I would recommend at least a trial subscription - my bet is that you'll like it 
If you are an adrenaline junkie and just don't have the time or money to do it all than this magazine will help you feel the rush; granted it is not the same as doing the activity but it'll work, sort of. I'm a current subscriber and have also been one in the past. I guess I came back because I just love the stories of adventure in faraway places that I may never get to see;it's the longing for adventure that never can be fulfilled. They usually have some good excercises to help your cross training, plenty of pictures of far away exotic places,and several adventure stories. This month they have a story on the war in terror in paradise(direct from the Phillipines). Another cool thing is they usually have the latest gadgets to make your sporting adventure less of a roughing it adventure. Whether or not you ever use these items is irrelevant, it is just good to know that technology is accelerating faster than the average persons checkbook can keep up with:( They also usually feature an athelete of the season to hook you in. There is also alot of eco-news for all the tree huggers, best new websites ,films, books and other media sections; in essence, there is something for everyone who loves the outdoors. It is perfect for great armchair outdoorsing after that workout to feel completely content 
I am mostly a low energy, armchair traveller but enjoy photography and reading about exciting new places and activities. This magazine has fit all these criterias. Outside focuses on exploring different locales that are extremely exciting as opposed to standard vacation hotspots such as Florida, the Carribbean, or Hawaii. The articles transport you to rafting Victoria Falls, deep water dives in South Africa, Alaskan fishing and hiking, plus lots of remote places such as Dominica or the Seychilles. I love how vibrant and rich the photography is and how well covered the articles are. Mind you there is something wondeful about reading magazines that highlight typical vacation spots, but for the adventuresome who like off the cuff travels, reclusive lodges, eco-villages, and remote islands this would be more your speed. 
For the guy that loves the outdoors and all the wonders that it provides, "Outside" is the magazine for him. Filled with straightforward info on travel, workout and health tips, and those little gadgets that make outdoor activities easier to tackle, this publication hits the nail on the head. I would've never discovered it if it hadn't been offered as a one of the perks for renewing my subscription with a magazine readers' service, and for that, I am grateful 
If you are open minded and passionate. Flaunt is for you. The most amazing photoshoots, with a vision that only a freak can relate too (in a good way). the creativity is always has a unique flavor with a new twist monthly 
GREAT photos! Cool little articles, though i would really only get this magazine for the excellent photography because it doesn't really focus on mass-media current events that you'd find in, say, a People or an Us Weekly. It has an upscale feel to it, and you can tell that there is a true vision behind this product. Anyone that is into the arts, particularly coiture, modeling, and photography would love this magazine for its visual energy and eccentricity 
The magazine is really great. Before i started reading flaunt i read surface* and wallpaper. Flaunt has more pop culture articles that I find more interesting than those in other magazines which seem like they are just made for rich people. Another good thing is that they avoid having too many articles about Europe and "Spring Break-like" travel articles which are reused in other magazines over-and-over. Another good magazine to read is Architectual Record. "One" was a really good magazine like flaunt, i don't even know if its still published anymore 
Flaunt is the best magazine I have seen on the shelves in a while. It combines both good articles with good design. I hope it stays as wonderful as it is 
this mag. is amazing. i love the eclecticness. its not too much of a production like vogue. and i cannot stand cheesy instyle that tells you how to dress like a celeb. no. This is truly an art inspired fashion magazine that knows where its roots are 
I've been looking for a good outdoor magazine for some time. Most focus on hunting or fishing, while there's nothing wrong with that, I just don't do those things very much anymore. Some, like Outside, have become political rags written by people who know virtually nothing about the outdoors. Backpacker, however, focuses on hiking and camping like it should. The skills and survival issues are priceless. Sometimes they go overboard on gear reviews, but many are also valuable, better than one I read in Adventure magazine (if you are spending hundreds of dollars on jeans for hiking, something is wrong with you). There's been many good articles on people and places in the hiking and camping world. A great resource for hikers, geocachers, campers and climbers. 
I'll never subscribe any other way again. The magazine started arriving exactly when they said it would 
This magazine is great and their customer service is awesome. After several mail changes, they sent me magazines that didn't get forwarded to me without any questions. The articles are great and this is one magazine I don't let any of my friends borrow, I'd never get it back. Planning your hikes works very well, but always do your own research. The gear testing articles are top knotch and have saved me mucho dinero. 
I look forward to Backpacker every month. It mixes practical trail information about hikes with feature stories, articles about gear, and always has great pictures. Most of the columnists and regular features are also interesting. I find one of them annoying, but I can live with that. The magazine has recently gone to a regional focus that gives people day hikes "where they live." That's great if you're on the west coast, since you'll get some California hikes if you live there, some Washington hikes if you live there. But the Midwest stretches from Michigan to Texas. Here in Indiana, I'd rather get Appalachian trails (or southern trails from Alabama and Mississippi) than trails from Texas or Oklahoma. Could we have a "Great Lakes" region, maybe? Also, the magazine is heavily dependent on equipment advertising and that's obvious in the editorial content. The magazine's philosophy is that of the unreconstructed gearhead who loves spending money on stuff. I know that's how the magazine business works, but I don't have to like it. Those complaints aside, it's the best backpacking magazine out there, and well worth the price of a subscription 
I'm not much of a magazine guy, but I must confess I am thoroughly addicted to this one. It is smart, fun, helpful, inspiring and well written. Content usually includes: a backcountry skill, a lightweight tip, a couple underrated destinations, caring for some body part that is troublesome when backpacking, backcountry food ideas, as well as a number of other brief tips, debates (e.g. deodorant, worth the weight?) trail suggestions and commentaries. There are also always extensive gear reviews (and an annual dedicated issue) that I could do without, but I'm sure are helpful to gear addicts. Oh, and the photography is fantastic. On the whole this is a great little publication that really accentuates the backpacking experience and allows you to live it vicariously when you are not able to get to the mountains 
Backpacker is a rare thing in the periodical market: a magazine that never has a weak issue. I have subscribed to Backpacker for a year now. It has only gotten better in that time--truly going from strength to strength. If you love the outdoors, this is the magazine for you. Your level of experience at things like hiking, camping, rock-climbing, snowshoeing, canoeing, kayaking, and yes--backpacking, is not an issue. This magazine consistently has something for people of all levels. My debt to these pages is great indeed: I have learned some skills and honed others. I have discovered (and visited) some places I did not know existed. It was in Backpacker that I was tipped off about the Beans at the Roosevelt Lodge (this alone being worth the price of subscription). I love: the Reader's Choice Awards, the Gear Guide Issue, the work-out plan from last year's spring hiking issue, and the stories/feautures. I didn't think they made magazines like this anymore. I was wrong. Backpacker is an excellent publication. I give it my highest recommendation. Get a copy today. 
Muscle and fitness is a decent magazine. its like most all else out there. a bit slim, but good articles beyond just working out. theres not magically gonna be a new bodypart that appears in a future magazine. you can only train the bodyparts you have. so all the posts saying "its the same articles, big chest, huge arms, etc" those are the ones that might wanna start reading the articles a bit more than "judging a book by its cover.....or title spot" reason being, i;ve read this since the beginning of highschool and am now a college graduate for three years now. over 10 years of reading this magazine and yea... its the same bodyparts mentioned in a certain rotation... HOWEVER EACH ARTICLE HAS SHOWN DIFFERENT METHODS FROM MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. its like baking a pie people.... apple pie consists of crust, install the apples, bake,then eat. however not every apple pie is made nor tastes the same. if more people would quick bickering over the bodyparts covered (which are limited being that humans havent changed much over the past hundred years as far as bodyparts are concerned) and pay more attention to: 1) the nutrition studies 2) different methods and tips from various people to work a part 3) new breakthroughs in supplements and nutrition. 4) and perhaps the other nicknacks sections of new products outside the gym world more people would learn more and less people would be out of shape in this country. if you actually wanna read a magazine for articles different methods and nutrition studies, this is a decent one. if you are one of the idiots who just look at pictures or article titles and ASSume its all the same and T then come to the conclusion without thouroughly reading, that the magazine is bad, go for a picture book instead 
What's bad: Too many adds, HOWEVER, there is always typed in letters at the top or the bottom of the add whether it is an advertisement or a part of the "real" Muscle Fitness magazine, so they are easy to scan by, if you're not looking to buy something. What's good: Just about everything else. Not every article is exceptional, but I find that there are always at least 2 or 3 articles that are just that. Just reading about these athletes extraordinary life is rewarding, and the information in the magazine is genuinely beneficial. Currently I am struggling to take in 6 meals a day, and every time I read an article, this or that bodybuilder tells me, that HE only started making serious gains when he got to 6 meals a day. So I keep my head down, and try and stick with it, even when it is hard. The point is, this magazine is GENUINELY INSPIRING, the information on training (go heavy and maintain tension in the working muscle throughout the motion + squeeze at top) and nutrition (eat many high-quality calories, lots of protein) is ALWAYS dead-on, and when you read about the athletes personal life, there is almost always something inspiring to gain from it (as the magazine has 'solid core values' as a must when choosing athletes for the magazine). For me, it is the perfect magazine, on building muscle, and doing so in a healthy fashion. I highly recommend picking up a copy somewhere (do read past the adds, some are cleverly camouflaged) and see for yourself. Sincerely, Jesper Bech, Denmark
