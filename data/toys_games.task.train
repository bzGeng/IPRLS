1	my 3 3/4 yr old got these for christmas and he loves them . plays with them almost every day . we bought both dinosaur kits and they are fun to combine together . my son loves to not only put together the `` proper '' dinosaurs , but make up his own creatures as well . a fun way for dinosaur loving kids to engage in some creative `` think outside the box '' play
1	i have wanted to buy a musini for my son for a few years now , but never found one in a retail store , online or local . i recently gave in and bought one gently used on ebay for a fantastic price including the cartridge . my entire family loves it , including my 2-year-old son . it was very easy to figure out how to use , even without a manual . on the battery case are very clear , easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your musini . within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing . even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the musini ! my dad could n't keep his feet still , insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute . i have found myself taking it out during my son 's nap time to put near me while i do the mundane chores around the house . it is really addicting and keeps us all moving ! i ca n't say enough good things about this toy . the music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to . you also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you 're dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers . the songs are mostly familiar and well-loved songs that you will instantly recognize . i have also noticed that you can use the musini to up your child 's physical activity . if you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard , you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise ! you can , of course , adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register . it 's up to you , and i think it 's fantastic ! highly recommended
1	my daughter rec 'd this game as a gift for her fourth birthday . it was wonderful because my son , who was two could play it too ( with my assistance of course ) . now they are 5 and 7 and still play it . it is a simple game that requires no reading skills and reinforces counting . i would recommend it to everyone
0	fisher price is selling the same item for only $ 33 . $ 139.99 has to be a mistake
0	our family bought this tank and we went through plenty of goldfish with it . we stopped buying when our 10 year old was using the scope to look at the fish . she was pulling it up and down and turning it and when she was finished , she put it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish . the fish was bleeding and died . the kids were not very happy . i guess this is an okay tank but not great . you might want to put only beta 's in it . i would suggest getting something with a filter and heater if you want any other kind of fish
0	i bought 2 pair and the light did not work on one pair at all and the light only worked on the other pair initially then stopped working as soon as the mask got wet ( and never worked again ) . very disappointing because they sounded like a lot of fun
0	i bought this for my 5 year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it . within a few days of careful use , one of the latches bent , a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued . it is a great idea , but needs better construction . on a positive note , my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if i let her . however , i had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before i can fix it . the drawers work fine . the problem is with the two doors on top that flip out . note about drawers ; little plastic door knobs pop out . need to be glued in .
1	i think that this was a great item - something unique from what i can usually find around here . my daughter loved it . like any other polly items , lots of little pieces but overall very nice . i was a bit miffed when i found out that the photo booth really does n't take photos . i guess i should have thought about that a bit more . overall , it 's just fine
0	ever wonder what drives someone 's daughter to go into porn ? this has got to be some of the most irresponsible marketing ever . please do yourself a favor and make sure toy companys get the message to stop peddling this type of garbage
1	i think that this was a great gift and definitely worth the money . i gave this to my 3 1/2 yr old niece as a christmas gift . she loves the wizard of oz . she is a big fan of dress up clothes and i also have two more nieces that roughly the same age so there was an outfit for each of them .
1	my 5-year-old adores this addition to his moonsand play set . the kit includes enough sand to make cars and other items to `` run over '' with the included monster truck . he had a ball and still plays with it at least once or so a week after a month of me purchasing it . the new inserted play mat for the original blow up moonsand kit makes it that more fun for him to play like he 's at the monster trucks show ! great idea ! for a new and fun way to make and keep moonsand play sets interesting . yes , moonsand can get messy , but did n't we all learn creatively through making messes when we were younger ? i 'll gladly sweep this up when he 's done
1	we had so much fun with this game . there are truth or dares and all sorts of fun questions ! i definatly recommend this game if you are having a party or even just a few people who want to have a good time ! totally worth buying this one
1	bought this game at books a million in north carolina for a mere $ 10+tax . a very good deal ! although i do n't keep up on a lot of contemporary literature , i was able to do pretty well . within three hours i had all but one pie . one of the teammates did as well . the third of us was n't as lucky , but it was a fun game nonetheless . as with all board games , the fun is in the company , not knowing all the answers . the questions were good , and yes - tough - but they were tough for all of us , not slanted towards one particular audience . i would have given this 5 stars except that there really do need to be more question cards . but for $ 10 , three adults had three hours of intelligent entertainment ( we went through half of the cards ) . we got our money 's worth
0	first of all , please realize that the customer pictures of this item are totally off . this thing is a foot cube , so there 's no way you could fit any baby outside of a newborn inside of it . that being said , when the cube first showed up , it seemed ok outside of the size , and my 2 1/2yr old son and 9-month old daughter seemed to enjoy it . that is , until my son realized that the wires on top were bent in such a way that there was no way for the elmo block to move at all . shoddy at best . we 've had this cube for a total of 3 days now , and already at least 4 stickers are off of it , due to not being placed center on the piece they were on , or just low-quality stickers . my children still play with the cube , as currently it provides no real safety hazard , but the price i paid for this cube was entirely too much considering the low quality .
1	i recently purchased this game using a gift certificate . my little boy loves it . i think it 's quite interesting as well but there were several typos on the game cards . frankly , there needs to be better proof reading . was this game assembled and printed in another country other than the usa . that would probably account for it
1	my son needed this gun to go with his halloween costume . needless to say he was thrilled with it . it has held up under a lot of use , and the noise is not too loud and irritating .
0	do not waste your money on this toy , the battery is not available for this toy . learn from my mistake . do n't waste your money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9.6 volt battery is not included , all it says , is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote . do n't look for the tyco 9.6 volt battery in a store or on line , because it will be `` out of stock '' . i have been trying to purchase one for 4 months
0	i just saw this today in 2 stores ( both priced at 19.99 ) , and both stores had a lot of these games , also ebay has a ton of these going for less than $ 20 ! this price is absolutely ridiculous ! ! !
0	my son waited 8 hours to play with his `` lighning mcqueen '' only to be disappointed . this thing is way to expense to only jerk around my kitchen floor ! my only hope is i can return this dumpy car because my son tore into the box with excitement ! shame on disney . do not buy
0	i bought this for my 5 year old and as another reviewer said ... .he would have to be double his size for it to fit ( he wears a size 5-6 ) ... .and the items attached to it keep falling off . we had to duct tape it together to fit him because of course i would rather have returned it ... but it was his favorite present ! ! ! it frustrates him a lot so i do not see him sticking with it !
1	i bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old daughter for xmas and she was extremely impressed along with myself . it 's exactly like the `` real thing '' just smaller ! very durable , colorful , and fun ! it 's great to use with the zapf creation dolls that tend to weigh more than a smaller baby doll b/c the car seat is so sturdy . unlike most car seats this does n't collapse and fold up whenever you actually try to carry it by the handle ! it is definately worth the price
0	the controller range is less than 40 feet . this car is much too fast for the short range . it is very easy to outrun the contoller . there is also a delay between control input and vehicle response . all batteries were new and fully charged , checked with a meter . a scanner verified that nothing was causing frequency interference . the older tyco turbo cars had a 100 foot controller range and no delay . tyco apparently changed the design to the new digital control to allow multiple cars to run at the same time
0	i have to agree with the first two comments . we went to check it out after my 4 year old saw it on tv and liked it because the bear had glasses just like him . the product seemed decent in the store , so we bought it . he has only played with it once or twice since christmas . the only time he had fun with it was when i got mad and yelled at the thing because it would n't do what it is supposed to . save your money and do n't buy this junk
1	my five year old loves this . has the cutest songest and easiest lyrics to remember . so easy for a little kid . fun , fun , fu
1	i bought this for our grandson age 13 soon to be 14 and he was very pleased with it . he did say that it was a little more difficult to put together but he did it and was very pleased with himself and with the results . thank you for making this possible . the price was right
0	the figure was sent back for a replacement because the legs did not fit into the body , it was defective . the same problem with the replacement and it was returned as well .
1	my son has really enjoyed the play center . it was easy to assemble and it seems to be holding up well with several children playing on it at the same time
0	my 2 year old son loves to `` cook '' and to serve mommy and daddy meals from his kitchen . my only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor . it is n't very sturdy , but i 'm not unhappy with this purchase
1	all year long , my three and a half year old daughter asked for a digital camera for christmas . 3-weeks before christmas , she sat on santa 's lap at the mall and asked for a trumpet of all things . i immediately came home and searched online . everyone had the colorful play trumpets that were electronic with diferent characters on them , but none of them looked real ! and i 'm pretty sure that my daughter was expecting santa to bring a real trumpet , so i found this , ordered it and it was here before the estimated delivery date ! it is extremely lightweight ( can not be used as a weapon ) , each button has a different tone to it and it looks real ( besides the fact that it 's not brass ) . she loved it ! she plays it all the time and unbelievably , it 's not the most annoying toy she has . i would recommend it to anyone with young children interested in musical instruments
1	the story of `` hansel and gretel '' is more than a warning against children talking to strangers ( or trying to eat their houses ) . the recurring image of the forest in german fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen , while the fact the father of hansel and gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time . therefore , what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions ( she stores not only treasure but food ) , which would make her death some sort of proto-marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction . in the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as little brother and little sister . the brothers grimm chose hansel because it was a common name in german fairy tales ( their equivalent of john doe so to speak ) and picked gretel for essentially the same reason ( which makes her jane doe ) . gretel ( or gretchen ) is a form of the name margaret , which in latin ( margarita ) means `` pearl . '' all that background makes it rather ironic that for its twisted fairy tale series mcfarlane toys has turned gretel into a german princess , striking a pose that suggests `` getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries . '' this six-inch figure has tattoos , a spiked collar around her neck , and torn fish net stockings . there are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully , and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage , gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood . she also has a mop and a pail , and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them ( the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the grimms tale ) . twisted fairy tales is the fourth series of mcfarlane 's monsters , and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only gretel 's tag team partner hansel , but red riding hood , peter peter pumpkin eater , and little miss muffet . if you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that mother goose had a twisted sense of humor . with these figures mcfarlane toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level . even if you do not want the entire set , there should be one of these figures that captures the jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you
1	bought this for my boy who just turned 11 . let 's just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with . two blinking lights on weapon . one light on helmet which makes the eyes glow . a little pricier than other bionicles but worth it . not too hard to put together , just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you do n't lose them while assembling the guy . the folks at lego are geniuses , sure it 's a franchise , but they 're doing a great job keeping it interesting
0	not the best toy i own . i wanted to send it back after a week because the letter c would n't say it 's name . after a while it started working , but then d stopped . according to the online demo the balls will say their colors when dropped in the chute . mine never have done this . my son likes this product and uses it . as a parent i am disappointed in the quality
0	i would not suggest the purchase of this product as you will only get a few laughs before it starts falling apart to a useless stage . if you have the money , and you want to buy it go ahead . maybe it 's a great product and i just got a defective one , but still not a good show of product to me on their part
0	i miss happy family . i have some . i like this doll that im reviewing but mattel tell the happy family fans like me that this doll is not midge
1	i bought the sea monkeys on mars for my 7 year old son . he loves them . they hatched easily , grew quickly and are quite cute . he loves to feed them and watch them swim . they are eductational and fun
1	you need to be old enough to look at a set of several horse cards and decide which kind of horse show a particular hose would do best in and which horse you would get the most points for if you had that particular horse compete in a dressage show , jumper show , ect . points are added up and who evers horse earned the most points wins that horse show and that player gets to keep the cards . so i would say ages 8 to 12 , but younger children could play with help from someone who can read and add up numbers . there is a limited amount of rounds in a game , since there is a limited number of cards to play for each horse show so the game last around 15 minutes or so . i like this part a lot , since games like war `` chomp '' can go on forever . it does take a table top to play the game , i originally purchased the game for my daughter thinking she could play it on the bus with a friend , but you need to have a surface to lay out some cards . i quess you could try to squeeze them onto a larger text book laid onto your lap . but it would n't be easy .
0	i got this product for my daughter . the password feature was difficult to program and the voice recognition was so precise it was almost impossible to reproduce the right voice inflection and pattern for the journal to recognize . my daughter often could not make the journal open . after a frunstrating week or two , she stopped playing with it altogether
0	the product shown does not match the description . it is not the marble roller coaster kit . please fix
1	if you dont have a obiwan pilot just buy a rebel pilot an put it in the ship i did it a i licke it and if you have obiwan imagine it change cloth . i thinck this starfighter is best only for the colors because for me al jedi starfighter are the same and the firing misiles i tacke them out because then they get lost
0	i purchased this for my daughters 2nd birthday . withing the first 5 minutes the back of the chair part for the high chair had broken off and would not stay on . the first time she went to take it in the bath pooh 's arm came off and will not go back on . i am just really disappointed that it was n't anything as great as i thought it would be . i saw the it in the store and was excited that my daughter would love it , but sadly it was very depressing for both of us
0	... does n't make it a great toy . a lesson learned the hard way . this toy is unbelievably loud . so loud , my husband and i ca n't stand to be in the same room with our son when he 's dancing ( stomping ) on it . so ridiculously loud , my son ca n't play with this toy inside at all anymore . every time he moves , the songs start over . grates on your nerves after the 5th or 6th stomp . what a disappointing toy . we 've had it out of the box three or four times to play with . it is now hidden in the deepest darkest part of the hall closet until we make our next round of donations to good will . save your money for one of the other good dance mat toys on the market . this one 's a stinker
1	i wish i had one of these when i was a kid . the canopy tops this stand , it rotates to block the sun . every passerby will know what 's for sale . we even use it inside for play . it 's a well made toy and i would purchase more products from this company
0	i bought this for my son 's fourth birthday because he 's a superhero nut . it 's a cute toy except for one critical flaw : it does n't come anywhere near fitting around the waist of my average-sized 4-year-old ( wears a size 4t ) . i 'm talking about three inches of waist gap on even the smallest setting . yet the belt can be adjusted to a size that would fit a teenager . if you have a 9-year-old who loves running around in a batman costume , go for it . as for my 4-year-old , he still plays with it sometimes , but we keep it on him with a pair of firefighter 's suspenders . update : the thick plastic of the belt is now ripped halfway apart . we 've only had it two months , and he 's hardly played with it for the abovementioned reasons . not so great for batman , but perfect for playing super chintzy toy man
1	this is fun . not easy for 5 and under , but great for the rest of us . ( 7 - 65 ) . gave us alot of laughs
0	i bought it for my son to use with the original pixter also . and , i found what it was compatible with , after i realized that it did n't work with the original pixter . the box i have says down in the bottom right corner ( if the back of the box is facing you ) of the back of the box in tiny print `` compatible with pixter plus and pixter 2.0 '' . you would think they would put that on the front
1	we love the accessories this item comes with but the doll itself is ... we have mixed feelings about her . my daughter , 4 , loves her hair because it 's so different from all her other barbies , but she hates her feet . her feet are way too big , even bigger than ken 's ( my daughter tried making her wear ken 's shoes but it did n't work ) . another thing we love and hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge ( good ) , and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls ( bad because she ca n't use the other doll 's clothes )
0	this game was not at all what i expected . the steering wheel and pedals are just for looks . you actually have to control the game with arrow buttons on the steering wheel . and many of the games had nothing to do with driving . so glad i opened it to try it before christmas morning . this is one toy that is headed back to the store
1	these make meals a lot more fun for children ... i know my son loves them
1	i looked everywhere for a plastic durable toybox , seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept anything in stock to look at in person . i took a chance on this one because the price was right , and i 'm very pleased . i like the pockets on the front , my son loves putting his books in out . if i would change one thing it is the lid . it is lightweight as to not hurt little hands fingers ( which is good ) , but is never locked onto the toybox , it lifts off very easily , so sometimes just bumping it causes it to fall out of the shallow indentations it sits in . other than that we love it
0	it 's a very cute lamp , but it 's very noisy ! i had read the reviews and other people had said it 's noisy but i did n't think it would sound like something ready for liftoff ! !
1	these 'cars ' characters are all quality die-cast replicas that kids young and not so young can enjoy . the kids love playing with them and so far , our 'cast members ' are still intact . but they do look so good you might want to put one on your desk ... the details : painless shopping and quick shipping , as usual on amazon
1	my son got this toy for his birthday about a year ago , when he was two . it was one of the gifts we let him pick out on his own . he loved it and played with nothing else for a week ! the songs are cute and familiar to him , plus barney talks and sings to the music . the only draw backs were that i could n't find an off button and that it is $ 20+ at local retailers . i wish the toys companies would cut us parents a little slack . lol
0	i purchased two of these cases for my daughters , ages 5 and 7 , but we were all disappointed with them . it supposedly holds 3 barbies and their accessories , but they are hard to close if you put that much stuff in . they also come apart everytime the girls open them , and they are hard for the girls to put back together . they are good for keeping all the little barbie accessories out of the way . i just wish they were better quality . a friend of mine has a soft plastic case for her daughter ( with a zipper ) , and she says it is great , but i have not been able to find that item anywhere
0	does n't fit well on my son 's wrist . it is difficult to close , and when worn the thumb trigger only works 10 % of the time . i think he 's played with this once since getting it for christmas .
1	this is now on clearance at target ... $ 199.99 . they 're going fast , i hid one in a display wooden chest in the furniture department til it drops even lower
0	i do n't know why this is , but when i put on the dale sr. shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls
0	we bought a pair of these thinking they 'd be an ideal gift for our 4-year-old nephew . they look great , and the hands-free styling is nice . but it 's a good thing we tested them before wrapping the gift . they work terribly . we got very flaky reception with a lot of background noise , and we were less than 40 feet apart . they are promptly being returned
0	its disgusting that any company would make this figure into a toy . complete with knives ? geez give the kid a manuel next time
0	i got this to for my daughter for her birthday . i opened it and put the bubble solution and batteries into it and it worked fine . later that night the bubble blower was n't blowing anymore . so the next morning i changed out the batteries and still it was n't working . i returned it the next day . it was really cute and i wanted it to work but it just would n't start and it also kept leaking . every where i put it the sticky soap mess was there after i picked it up . this was not a good toy
0	if one good thing can be said about dread pirate , it 's that the physical game components reek of quality . the cloth game board , glass jewels , metal coins , wooden dice and pewter game pieces all come together to give an overall sense of realism to the game . it 's a pity , however , that the game itself is n't nearly as exciting as the pieces . dread pirate relies entirely on random dice rolls to determine every single outcome of the game . to move from place to place , you roll dice . to challenge another player to a `` skirmish '' ( which is how you steal their treasure ) , you roll dice . to steal jewels from an enemy 's port , you roll dice . to trade for jewels at a port , you roll dice . there 's absolutely no semblance of any real strategy in this game . you win by accumulating the most treasure , and the amount of treasure you accumulate depends entirely on how lucky you are in your roll of the dice . this game is not fun , and can even be frustrating , especially for a young child who keeps rolling low numbers . there 's some thinking involved ... you need to judge for yourself who you should attack and when , but even if you make the best possible strategic decision , you can still lose the die roll and end up empty-handed . i would recommend dread pirate only if your family is specifically looking for a game where you do n't have to think , and only if your children are mature enough to deal with bad luck ( as good/bad luck is the only way to win/lose this game ) . if you 're looking for an enjoyable family game that everyone can play , i would very much reccommend cranium over this . it 's less expensive , there 's alot more to it , and it will have your family getting up , being active , and laughing out loud ( instead of sitting around and rolling dice to determine the number of jewels you can take )
0	this tractor is advertised as a great back yard toy but is geared to high for younger children . my son , who is almost 4 is a very stong bicycle pedaler but he can not make this tractor move across the lawn . it would be great if you have a lot a pavement to ride it on , but if you planning on them ridding it through the back yard , forget it . this is an on pavement toy only
0	i bought this toy last year for me son . he really did not care for the toy at all , but he loves elmo . the crayons were way too messy and melted really fast
0	as far as i know there is only one tempo and one type of dance sequence on this mat . no matter how much we play around with the different buttons it does not do anything different . this was a big request from my 6 year old daughter for christmas and now she hardly plays with it . it entertains our 15 month old twins more ! resist any begging by your kids for this item and buy something else , a cd boombox maybe
1	this toy is awsome ! i truly recomend this to you and all your friends ! ! !
0	i recieved the car and set it up according to the manufacturers instructions and it did n't work ! i contacted the manufacturer and they mailed me a shipping return label and i returned it to them . i am awaiting a new or fixed car back from them
0	like many of the other reviews ( that i read after receiving the doll ) , i got a hispanic doll with red hair ... whoever heard of that ! my daughter is adopted from guatemala and has black , straight hair ... . this doll depicted how i style her hair and would have been a perfect match , as it also had black hair ... . after waiting for a week , i received the doll , expecting it to look like the one pictured , and it was n't ... . i am highly , highly disappointed , and have emailed all of my contacts telling them about this and giving them the sight to view all the unhappy comments on this as well as pass along to their contacts ... .. i will never make this mistake again ... . as the saying goes ... . `` fool me once , shame on you ... fool me twice , shame on me ... . well , shame on them ! ! !
0	this is pretty much kid vs kid only . adults can not play along . you can make it into a solo game for one child , but its really more like flash cards for spelling if you do that . the product is basically a set of flash cards for spelling , with some letter cubes for the kids to spell out the words . the rules propose two games , which are basically see if the kids spells the word right , they get to keep the card if they do , first kid with 5 cards wins . adults can pretend to play along if the child is younger and will `` fall for it . '' it really works as a game only if there are two kids the same age playing . i do n't know , but i ca n't see my daughter pulling this out when a friend comes over . therefore , to the extent this is a set of flash cards for spelling , its kind of expensive for what it is . do n't get me wrong , you can definitely make it into a learning tool . your call .
1	makuta is sooooooo cool ! i love his giant staff/pitchfork.i think he is one of the best bionicles there is ! probably the only thing that stands in his way is the exo- body special bionicle
0	our son has dyslexia . we are using this as a tool to build his family of sounds and spelling rules . he thinks it is fun and is building on his skills at the same time
0	this game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes . also , if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again . it 's a huge waste of money . for 30.00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the dvd or have more than one dvd included in the game . this is a big disapointment
0	am totally dissatisfied with ths wagon as it came dented . the wagon is shipped in a cardboard box with no styrofoam or other packing - the wagon bed absorbs any impacts . the parts are in the bed and there is cardboard to prevent scratching - there were no scratches and the finsih was nice . the pacaging is totally inadequate . i would return the wagon if time permitted . i am glad that i am not giving it to a child as a gift . buy it where you can look it over first to be sure it 's not damaged
1	i have a videonow player and i luv it ! ! ! there are over 100 discs !
0	the features on this toy are cute , just not planned out very well . my boys love the music and bubbles , but the micky and goofy that go up and down on the sides broke off after a couple days . the voice recorder is very hard to work because of a short cord . for a ride on my boyslike the radiio flyer retro rocket more . overall , in our house this is a bubble machine .
0	i could get the aircraft to pickup and eventually hover but there is no such thing as getting that thing to go in the direction you want it to . i put the aluminum weights on the nose to get it to move forward that way all i had to do was turn it in the direction i wanted it to go . it is very difficult and is no way as easy as it looks on tv . and i 've practiced a lot
1	i read the reviews before buying this product , and i do agree that it is messy with the markers , suitable for children that are a little older . it is fun , and very cute , but a little messy to wash off . i just buy a pack of baby wipes at the dollar store , and let the kids clean off the screen with them , and then throw them out . it works wonderfully , and the problem is solved , since the included sponge is not very helpful . i would purchase this again , especially for the price
0	my stepmom bought a set of these for each of my three kids ages 12 , 9 , and 6 . all i have to say is do not buy these ! ! ! ! my six year old did great on the first page but as the other reviewer said the film gets all over the markers . we even tried washing them off and it did no good . also when my 6 year old was coloring he would rest his arm on the bottom of the page and when he would pick it up it would be covered in black . bottom line about 30 minutes after they got them my kids arms and faces were covered in black smudges as were my hands somewhat just from holding their pictures to look at them . messy messy messy . my 12 year old finally just went and stuck one of the papers under running water and washed off all the black to see the neon underneath and this proved to be the least messy but least rewarding way to do it . good idea bad execution . my kids who are crazy for any kind of arts and crafts hated these things . save your money and buy regular papers and markers and crayons
0	the toy is a good idea , but it needs to be more user friendly , instructions are hard to follow , even for adults , maybe not quite so much activities at one time , could simplify some for younger players
1	i purchased this item for my 4 years old neice . she is dora crazy as my 6 year old was at 2 and 3 years old . my daughter has the older version and she still plays with it . it 's her house for her and her dolls . my neice is also enjoying her dora house . great gift . it does not take up too much space . you can slide it under a bed , behind a couch etc . dora house is great !
0	i bought this product after pulling numerous items out of the toilet . the suction cups never really fit securely to the toilet and after i finally thought i had it right , i found the toilet lock floating in the toilet like everything else .
1	i bought this for my son for christmas after he saw it advertised in a magazine . he has been playing with it almost non-stop since then . it is loud and somewhat intricate but easily masterable by small kids . it also connects with other matchbox sets and comes with a mat for layout . based on my boy 's interest and use so far , this rates 5 out of 5
1	bertie is nice . he has no magnetic pieces so he wo n't hook to other things . nice 16month old tries to use him on the train track which does work but he was n't really meant for that and can be hard to push on the track
0	this machine does not work . i will be returning it to find a better `` first '' machine for my daughter . the stitiches do not hold , every instruction was followed to the letter . it is not worth even 4 cents , much less 14 dollars . i would have paid more for something that acutally works . i 'll keep lookin
0	my twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3 . they loved it ! ! ! the dog is so cuddly and cute . they loved playing pretend with the accessories . my only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off , the syringe was coming apart , and the brush had lost a couple of bristles . the boys had not played rough with it , it just was n't the quality that i had hoped for . it is a real favorite of theirs , i am just afraid that it wo n't last as long as their imaginations . i think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy . a real winner for young children in the hospital .
0	my son is 5yrs old and this was one of the 1st things on his christmas list . he loves power rangers of all kinds but when we finally opened this and i tried to put it together ... i thought i was doing it wrong b/c nothing fit or stayed together ! ! my son still played with the dragon part that was already put together but the storage bin is useless and the rope that the power ranger can `` slide '' down is barely high enough that he stays off of the ground and he pretty much falls down rather than sliding down . the so called `` instructions '' were horrible and another reviewer was correct in indicating how small the pictures were . i would have never wasted my money on this if i would have read the reviews 1st ( i usually do ) . my son played with it for about 5-10 minutes and then asked why santa would bring him something like that . in my opinion it was a huge waste of about $ 50 and gave santa a bad name with my son for bringing him such a piece of junk
1	my son and i thoroughly enjoyed assembling and learning about how robots work . this kit may be frustrating for one adult or child to assemble . the screws require more 'adult strength ' ( he would start them and i would finish ) and some of the instructions might need at least 3 hands to hold and assemble . but hey , that is why it was so enjoyable - we did it together ! it is fun now to watch him play with it and tell everyone 'my dad and i built this '
0	my 10 year old son got this for his birthday . the screws are so deep inside the ball , we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out . ( the ball wo n't bounce anyway ! ) even then , the screws would not come out ! the lightup goal is great , but the ball is ridiculous . use your old nerf balls and then it 's okay
0	my daughter loved this toy but the microphone stopped working within a week of using it . now we are shopping for a wireless microphone
0	i support the comments that others make : this game is so poorly designed , it is laughable . i can not imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once . forget trying to follow the directions ; they left out many important rules . the board does n't work , especially the way the pieces fit into it , and what a terrible ending with a spinner that does n't even work like a spinner . what is up with that ? forget this game
1	i really love this table set.i bought this for my 3 year old ... i dont have to worry if she s running around the table b/c its safe and made of plastic ... its light so easy to move around ... easy to claen ... reasonable price ... i thnk i love it but i just wish that table size wa a little larger
0	my sons got this toy for their 1st birthday since their physical therapist recommended getting a push/ride on toy with a wide base for learning to walk . while they enjoy the buttons and sounds and like being pushed around on it , i do not find it helpful for development . the handle pushes forward and comes off very easily , it is not heavy enough for them to pull up on without tipping over onto them , and the seat is very wide and square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they would be able to ride it . also some of the stickers are starting to peel off and we 've only had it a month . for an older child it would probably make a decent ride on toy , but if you are wanting a push toy to help with early walking , keep looking
0	what a disaster . it takes too long . then you get a tiny gross little blob of `` cotton candy '' . it is quite a mess to clean . then the kids will cry because it is not at all what they expect and are so disappointed . my 5 year old wants to know how santa 's elves made such a `` stinky , bad toy '' . expect to be disappointed with this one
1	nursing nana is a great gift . it is soft and cuddly , and the puppies attach with magnets , giving a realistic nursing `` tug '' as you attach and detach them . this would be a great gift for a child when a second or third child is being born to take the angst out of mom nursing the new baby . it is a bit smaller than i anticipated , but it is still worth it because it is well-made
0	this was a christmas present and it continues to fall apart . the archways do not stay on them . too expensive for what you really get . i ended up putting most of it away except for the center cake piece and the cats . i would not buy it
0	this toy , like several other mattel toys i 've purchased in the past 5 years are difficult to put together , troublesome to play with , and not durable . i wish mattel would think more about the kids playing with their toys and less about the stockbrokers . toys can be easy to assemble . intuitive to play with and rugged as a tank . it just depends on priorities of the toy design/builder
1	i 'm not one for guns in my household , but my potty-training son really wanted this blaster gun . he 's a total star wars fan ( like his father ) and i told him that he could have it if he said good-bye to diapers . he did . so we ordered it and waited for the ups man to come . he was so excited when it was delivered . he thought the ups man was so cool for giving that to him ! anyways , there is so much detail on this blaster gun . the sounds are pretty cool and it lights up red . my son loves the sight scope too ! big hit in our household ! ! !
0	i have been searching for the perfect handheld sudoku game and this is not it . i found it very difficult to see the numbers without a backlight even with my reading glasses . also i would perfer a stylus pen instead of having to scroll around the screen to enter a number . i do like the idea of being able to use a dry erase pen to mark off numbers , but i could n't even see those . still searching
1	my niece is about to be two and she loves school buses , so i thought this would be worth a try . she loved it ... hours of fun and if you are patient you could fold it back up and put it back in the box
1	i thought this would be a great gift for my child since she is an avid soccer player and very creative . the markers provided were not any different than ones that we use for crafts . i hope that her design will stay on the ball after playing with it
1	my 3 1/2 year old son has older sisters with ipods and always wants to use them to listen to . we bought this for him for christmas and he calls it his ipod and he absolutely loves it . we download new songs and stories from time to time as a reward . we also bought the speakers for him to listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging out at home . it 's tough and durable and withstands being dropped and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out
1	my eight and nine year old sons are big lego fans . i bought one set for each of my boys and they each built a different model . both models came out great . the parts fit together beautifully and the finished product moves very well when played with . the vehicles are even better than they look in the pictures on the box . this was the first technic set that they tried . i hope they enjoy future technic sets as much
1	i was very pleased with the order and the speed at which it was delivered . more important , my grandson loves it . it was what he wanted and could not find it here so was very glad for amazon
0	i was really excited about this toy . i was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy , so i thought this would be a great toy for him to have some good quality tummy time on . wrong . he could care less about this toy . the second i 'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back . he was five months old when we bought it , and it is just sitting there . he still loves his gymini and he is six months old now . also , by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who has bought this thing . do not purchase this toy , it takes up too much space , and it 's a waste of money . baby could care less about it
0	the idea behind this is n't too bad , and my 4 year old really enjoyed them for a short time , but it has some really ridiculous quirks . the shoes are not on any type of timer , so they will stay on indefinitely unless your child turns off each of them individually . so what ends up happening , of course , is dead batteries within a day or so . the wand and the tiara both work fine , so maybe that set would n't be too bad , but it annoys me that they would even release something as ridiculous as this
0	i would give this toy a 0 if it was an option . when you unfold the tiny track and get the train going , it ca n't even make one corner turn without coming off the track ! the train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track . this is very frustrating for my kids and i can not believe they even put this on the market ? you ca n't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it . i am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is . we wanted this toy for portability . our kids also have the geotrax working railway , which is awesome , but not as portable
1	hi , esweetie i would love to be your friend . oh yeah this is a great doll you should really get her . end the bratz/ my scene war lenzie :
0	i bought this for my 2-yr-old at a rummage sale . he loves it ! but it 's very flimsy , the microphone gives constant feedback , adn the volume repeatedly resets to a dangerously loud level . it was worth the $ 6 i paid , but i would n't recommend buying it new
1	i love bratz , especially ice champions ! i want vinessa , and the big ice rink with maribel , the new girl . i 'm searching for the new bratz so if anyone knows any other ones except for rodeo sorya , diamondz sharidian , this doll , and maribel , please comment this . i want this girl , she 's so pretty ! i like how her hair is done and the outfit
0	bought this little cooler for the back of our atw wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the zoo etc . cooler holds temp fine and the velcro straps go around the wood railings well , but this a totally soft-sided cooler with no frame or supports , so if there is anything in it , the cooler does not hold it 's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the wagon . looks terrible and i would have been better just rigging up a mini igloo with bungees or somethin
1	i love that soft cat and thought i would get my real cat a friend didnt work oh wel
0	i purchased two of these hand held deal or no deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys . the boys found that they had trouble indicating that they 'd like to `` take the deal '' . when the pressed the button to say `` yes '' to the deal , the game continued as if they said `` no deal '' . they got annoyed , but kept on playing . i tried the game , thinking that they did something wrong , but i also had the same problem . i 'm annoyed because the game was $ 20 each and i think it does n't work properly !
1	this is a great ( and relatively cheap ) way to expand your brio starter set . a nice selection of straights , curves , and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction / fun . while brio in general is expensive , this track pack represents a pretty good value ( v. buying switches , curves , straights , etc on their own ... . although you 'll `` need '' to do that eventually too ! ) . the finish , fit , and quality is great . worth the money considering the play it 'll get it 's durability
0	i bought this toy for my shark-crazed 5 year-old ... she was so stoked and we prepped the tank , added the recommended water chemicals and dropped in two small goldfish . less than 24 hours later , they were dead . repeat ... 40 hours later ... same story . we tried a single betta , frank , but less than 4 days later ... he 's dead . we do n't know what it is . the water was tested , it 's fine . we think it is the overall design of the tank , could the tight-fitting lid be responsible ? possibly ammonia by-product buildup from the fish ? who knows . but we have given up and are dumping this promising toy into the trash bin
1	purchased the batman laptop computer at target for christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old . he was totally drawn in because it is batman ... .but the games kept his interest . the entire family enjoyed trying the different games . dad , a musician , enjoyed the music game . graphics are super ... i love the way batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right ... .and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red . grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even . worth the $ 38.99 i paid at target on sale for sure .
0	it is a waste of money and a big disappointment . i will be returning it .
1	i was pleasantly surprised at the quality and size of the pool . the price is quite reasonable , and i was not expecting such a great deal
1	we received this for my daughter 's 4th birthday . it has been a lot of fun to play -- simple enough for her to play , and hard enough to grow with her for the past year . although it has a lot of pieces , they have remained durable and have withstood tiny fingers .
0	wow ! this toy was made as cheap as possible . shame on crayola for not spending the extra pennies to make this more durable and a better quality product . great concept , but poor designers ! steps aside crayola - your name does n't stand for much anymore !
0	first i would like to say that when i purchased this item it was advertised as the `` hobby '' addition . when i received it i did n't think it was the hobby set so i called amazon , the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me . i called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and i have yet to receive a phone call back.. when i gave this item to my husband for christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the `` hobby '' addition . i was not only upset that i did not get what i was looking for but that no one had returned my call
1	we had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one . my girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make . the music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them ( ages 20 months and 3 1/2 )
0	this toy needs work ... first of all , it 's heavy ! my daughter ( now 19 months ) usually likes to pick it up and throw it . after all , it is a ball ! we have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors ! we do n't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you 're asked to find something on the ball , even i have a hard time finding it to push the button in time . so , i do n't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time . i think this is a nice idea for a toy , but it just does n't work . it is colorful , and my daughter does enjoy throwing it , but that 's obviously not it 's intended use . she never played with this toy as a crawling infant . she only plays with it now , and she only throws it . please do n't waste your money on this toy . it 's not worth it
0	i have since seen other similar complaints on several websites and have written to polyconcept . i have to date gotten no satisfaction from either crayola or polyconcept . the lines are blurry , there is no focus to begin with . but the real problem is that the projector detaches constantly from the base , whenever you move it , touch it , etc . the dry erase markers do n't erase from the board ; and the light stopped working after the second time my son played with it . i ca n't fathom buying a new light bulb at $ 4.95 + s after a total hour of use in two sessions . i think it 's probably wiring ; who knows ; but it 's a disappointing flimsy cheap piece of garbage .
0	ok , i do n't have this doll , i wo n't buy this doll ... if i ever have a little girl she will never have anything like this . i saw some girls saying how the doll was appropriate for 10-13 and i almost fell out of my chair ! this doll is -in-appropriate for someone under 21 ! the short skirts the short tops . how the heck can mattel think that this was a good idea ? i 'm 23 years old and i would never dress like that nor would i allow my child to dress like that . bottom line : shame on you mattel ! !
1	this was a super soft animal and one of the kids in my life ended up with it being and aunt/grandma a lot of them end up in new home
1	this toy looks very appealing . i purchased this for my son , 16 months at the time thinking it would be a great toy to stash in the kitchen cupboard so he could play while i cooked cleaned etc . he played with it about 4 times total and he 's 2 now ! it does n't do enough and does have much other than a shape sorter . i consider it wasted money but if my experience helps anyone i 'm glad
0	my nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture . unfortunately , the inflatable suit is not really inflatable . it requires constant air to keep it poofy looking . it is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower ( battery operated ) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated . the battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit . everytime he moves , it pops out . the fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy , deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him . he loves superman and loves having a cape . he opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with . i suppose we got what we paid for . cheap prices does n't equate to quality . i felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy . would not recommend it to anyone else ... unfortunately..
0	my cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces . however , she can not even use the gift . you need to buy the totally beadifully jewelry maker to use this kit . no where in the online description of this toy on amazon does it tell you this . toy is being returned b/c we do n't have the bead maker
0	when i first got it i was sooo excited ! but when i opened it , it had no instructions . even the 10 things to do with it didnt explain how to work everything . sure it was fun at first but then i realized , `` how am i supposed to do anyhting ? '' the semi worst part was the stuff stunk . i got really nauseous when i got a wift of it . now i can usually handle smells but this was the worst ! i got dizzy and almost through up ! i wish i could have soaked everything in like bleach or sumthin just to get rid of the stench ! i had to clean it too ! i kept pointing my nose in the other direction and walking away for fresh air ! i would not personally reccomend this . i ahve not been able to really use it ! ! i dont no if directions was supposed to come w/ it or what but i can tell you that i was not pleased !
1	this is a great pack for a day trip to grandmas . it only holds about 4 cassettes , so if you have a lot of books you should go with the zipper case . other than that , my daughter loves it
1	he loves the dog . i has very happy to find him . since toy story was out 10 years ago i did not thing i would ever find slink my grandsons favorite
0	not to impressed with this company . 3rd item i have bought and the table top had to be reglued and screwed . also the table top had major horizontal cracks . i do n't believe they check their quality of their products
1	we got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one . we love that it does n't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside . it still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable . if your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric . we also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there . we do n't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us . highly recommend !
1	i give puppytunes as a gift to all my friends that have a new baby . puppytunes is always their ( the baby 's ) favorite toy ! :
0	i have bought quite a few barbies from amazon recently , including the caligirl series , fashion fever series , and barbie loves micky mouse . this barbie is quite different to all above . she does not have a rubber skin like others , so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts . her foot is quite flat ; only the slippers in this package fit her ; all other barbies ' shoes do not . i guess this `` pooh '' might be made with the `` former generation '' technology
0	like many my age , i grew up with legos . my wife bought this kit for me for christmas . i was excited . after a couple of days of work , my excitement had turned to frustration and finally to anger . this kit is poorly designed , and the instructions are not well thought out . first , the `` death star '' is built on a base that you construct of legos . this base is not very sturdy . the instructions said to put a bunch of parts just on one side . left alone , the structure would tip over because of the imbalance . much of the structure had such flimsy connections that the slightest thing would break connections . i do n't mean the quality of the legos ; those things are impossible to break . i mean the way in which various bars , hinges , etc were put together . in the end my wife and i probably spent 40 hours building something that would not hold together . i love legos but this kit gets nothing but ill will for me . for lack of a better phrase , this kit sucks
1	what a great game ! my 4 year old loves the disney princess . it is such a great educational toy . we love it
1	my son love this toy . it also reenforces this shapes and colors . it 's a stepping stone for geometric patterns
0	this toy is a piece of junk . i ca n't believe disney actually did any testing whatsoever on this toy . an adult ca n't even get it to work . the car is supposed to sense the infrared light in front of it and follow , but all it does is jerk forward a teeny bit and then stop . if anything , it senses when the light clicks off and then it jerks forward a little bit . we read the instructions and saw that the car does not work well in bright lighting conditions so we took it down to the dark basement ( as if my son should actually be expected to only play with this car in the dark ! ) but it did n't even work there . big disappointment on christmas morning that we had to wait 8 hours for it charge , and then even bigger disappointment the next morning when we finally got to play with it and it did n't work . do not buy this toy
0	i could n't wait to play this game . i 've been a fan of snl for over 20 years . i was sooooo disappointed with this game . the questions are horrible ! they are difficult to read and undestand . the only good thing about the game is the fact that the game pieces are cool . otherwise , save your money . it 's not worth the $ $ $ $ . booo hisssss to the creators of this game ! you ripped off your biggest fans ! ! !
0	all non-yellow parts of the ducks are painted and come off pretty easily . a little moisture and some teeth for a minute can remove paint . this toy is best for those who are past placing toys or anything in their mouth . i still think they are cute and a great idea ... just need to be made better/safer
0	this car pictured could be a base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these are going for 100.00 and less on the web . if you havent noticed the differences in the packaging it wouldnt suprise me . lots of people dont notice . heres the differences below ... on these 5 cars there is two versions of each driver ( 5 different drivers ) that were made . first versions or base version and second versions or `` added features '' version . the first versions have no `` added features '' stickers and you can not race any two ( or more ) cars of the 5 different drivers ' cars at the same time ! dale sr. and dale jr. , jeff gordon , jimmie johnson and tony stewart cars of the first versions ( no added features ) can not race together ! transmitter frequencys can not be changed . speed and steering are straight function . ( no varilable anything ) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight . speed is either it goes full on or it doesnt . same for reverse gear . again , each of the 5 different drivers ' cars made are two different versions of the same car one has more features than the other . updated or `` added features '' versions have `` added features '' stickers . those `` added features '' are ... digital proportional steering ( variable steering ) , which means you can turn the transmitter wheel slightly and the car turns a little . turn the transmitter wheel alot and the car turns alot . variable speed control this means you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little , pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off ! this also works for reverse gears as well now if this isnt cool enough ... each `` added features '' car has different frequencies for different drivers ' car . the transmitters for the cars are different as well . `` added features '' version transmitter has two `` trim '' adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the frequency chip on the side of the remote than can be changed , and can also be changed on the chassis of the car . so if you own 2 of the tony stewart cars , you would have to have a frequency pack to race them at the same time . now , two or more different drivers ' cars can race together ( or five people can race 5 different cars ) . no two alike cars can race together unless you have the `` frequency of another car and transmitter '' to change it , or a `` frequency pack '' from team up inc. all 5 frequency chips do not come with the car in the box , off the shelf . this `` frequency pack '' is sold seperately ! you can also purchase tires , suspension parts and body hold down clips , fully painted and ready to use new spare or other drivers ' teams bodies , extra rechargeable battery packs seperately ! i have done lots of research on these cars and should you have any questions please ask ... nascarnbroncosfans @ msn.co
1	my son calls this a flute , and rather than argue , we let it go . but his little hands have a hard time holding it . ( he 's 4 ) . even i have trouble . i 'm right-handed and the right-hand keys are on the bottom . i do n't know if that 's how real clarinets are , but it 's awkward . also , your whole mouth has to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play , so that 's also a little frustrating . but the sound is great and it 's fun to play once you get the hang of it
1	i bought this wireless weather station as a gift . the recipient loves it . for the price , he is really enjoying it . the only things he would change are : -interface to computer so that data could be tracked -display of actual barometric pressure value these two features are available on more expensive models so i imagine in the future we will be upgrading
0	horrible advertising on these packages . it shows a huge delicious bowl of pasta when says 4 pack , but it only makes two `` bowls '' of pasta . the servings are so tiny , that if you make both packets together , you maybe get a half a bowl of pasta . not to mention that it takes about 11-15 minutes to cook ! pasta 's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray . the taste is so bad my son , who eats anything would n't touch it , and the sauce packet was hard as a rock , so it did n't mix up and left big chunks in the ketchup you have to add . we tried the mac and cheese too , it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack , but that 's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses . very expensive , hardly any food , and pretty nasty to eat . they need to be alot more realistic on their packaging instead of trying to use false pictures and saying `` 4pack '' eight thumbs down from this family
1	when my 3-month old nephew received this for christmas , my 15-month old and 3-year old immediately started fighting over it . they played with it so much that we decided to buy our own , even though i thought they might be too old for it . two months later , it is still the hottest toy in our house . the shapes are vibrant colors , rattle , and have rounded edges , making them easier than most shape sorters for younger children . the top and bottom pieces screw off to remove the shapes , and my 3-year old can take them on and off herself . my kids also like to lay the top and bottom pieces on the floor and set the shapes on them like it is a puzzle . they also like to play `` catch '' by rolling the sorter back and forth to each other . i would say this is one of the best toys you can buy for a 6-18 month old
0	these were purchased for my grandson for christmas . they are hard to get on . clumsy and do n't have the effect they would have you believe . he never really used them and a waste of money . they were useless and also very dangerous . defintely would not recommend .
0	my daughter received this for her third birthday from her grandpa and while it 's a great concept and i think she would really like it , it does n't really work . erasing each drawing is nearly impossible , and it bothers me enough that i know it will bother her to be unable to erase old drawings and start new . so we 're returning it for something else .
0	i bought this toy for my son for christmas . i thought he would enjoy the toy because he already likes to place balls and other items into baskets and he likes rattles . unfortunately the toy ended up being a disappointment because it is so loud ! it scares him everytime i turn it on and there is no way to control the volume . i know lots of kid toys are loud , but i have never heard one as loud as this one .
0	i only ordered this because my child was begging for the swimming mermaid . i compared amazon 's listing with the manufacture listing and ordered . we did not get what we ordered ... we got a barbie dressed in a mermaid costume , not the swimming one ! this was from santa and , i 'm sorry , but seeing that type of disappointment in a six year old 's eyes just breaks your heart . of course , it was after the packaging was torn apart to get her out and into eager hands . for the first time in my years of shopping , i feel robbed
1	an excellent project for your child 's school report . we purchased the velociraptor kit for our 8 year old daughter not knowing what to expect . after opening the package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds , instead of using the plaster mix that comes with the kit . we experimented with white chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones ! we buried these edible bones in ground up oreo cookies . what a thrill to see our daughter 's 2nd grade class excavate these delectible prehistoric fossils ! we ca n't wait to purchase other kits in the eyewitness series
0	our 7 yr old daughter was given this last christmas . it is awkward to use and the motor did n't seem to have the power needed to turn the wheel when the clay was on it . she ended up using the clay and molding it by free hand . it now sits in the corner of her activity table and is n't used at all .
0	my kids love magnetix , but i am unable to order them online because you do not ship to canada . this problem occurs a lot . someone should fix that . i find it very frustrating when i try to order something and then it tells me they are `` unable to fullfill my order because we ca n't ship outside the usa ''
0	all thomas the train products are overpriced . there are too many companies out there with a better selection of wood train sets for half the price . choose one of those ! save yourself some money
1	we have this up on the wall for our baby and use it as a diaper changing night light . the luminosity is just right for changing baby but is not too blinding for sleepy eyes . my 9-year daughter also loves to cycle through the phases before bedtime . the room has to be very bright for the night light to turn off automatically . the remote is very handy and we liked the 3 viewing options . we 'll be getting this as gifts for our friends and their babies .
1	this toy teaches history and stories to improve the imaginations of kids everywhere it and its others are a must have
1	this was a great addition to our read with me dvd collection . my son loves it - there are so many games and options available that it keeps him occupied for hours !
1	this is a great toy for kids of any age . we bought it last year when my daughter was 2 1/2 . she still plays with it . it folds up very nicely and no matter how many times her and my 6 year old son jump on the outside , it still looks like new . at my son 's 6th birthday party ( 13 boys , 2 girls ) , the kids stood with it upright and pretended they were an alien worm , while the other kids beat them with blow up swords . yes i was supervising , but the tunnel took the beating and is still in great shape . even out cats crawl through it . there are not many toys that are this much fun and durable
1	this is the best of the leappad books i have seen . my four-year old has spent hours on it . it 's very interactive and covers a lot of ground for that age . highly recommended
0	it looks fun in the picture , but there is a major design flaw with this toy - the wheels stick out so far that when the rider tries to go they end up slamming their ankle into the tire . within 2 minutes of using this toy my son ripped open his ankle . this toy should be recalled . do not buy it . i would send mine back , but we had already thrown out the packaging
1	my son likes this item . the cars also fit his train set from imaginarium . the only thing i did n't like about putting this together was the elevator . very tight fit and does n't like to go up or down easily . but everyone likes playing with it , from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds
1	this game is very easy to learn . each of the 16 playing pieces has 4 attributes , height ( tall short ) , color ( white and brown ) , shape ( circle square ) , and hollow/solid . the goal is to get 4 of the same attributes in a row ( for example , you could have 1 tall white circle , 1 short white circle , 1 tall brown circle , and 1 short brown circle in a row , and that would be a winning set because they are all circles , even though they vary with respect to the other attributes ) . the catch is that your opponent picks the piece you have to place on the game board . this game is similar to set , in that you are trying to make winning patterns across several attributes . it is different because you are also trying to block your opponent from making winning patterns . i do wish this game were less expensive so that more people can enjoy it . not everyone can drop $ 30 for a game . it is a beautifully made wooden game , but it would be just as much fun if it were made of something inexpensive and priced under $ 10 . nevertheless it is a game worth owning . and , for trivia buffs , this game was futuristic enough to appear in an episode of star trek voyager : )
0	the cursor is so minute it is difficult to see it . makes the game unplayable in most suitable environments . design issue could be fixed easily
1	this large collection of lego bricks is to my mind the `` classic collection '' . children of all ages ( and adults ) can build ships , planes , houses -- whatever the mind imagines -- in a variety of colors . the bricks come in a nice sturdy plastic container for convenient storage . while lego has gone on to develop a wide range of other products , for those who want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular image or character , this is a great product
1	one day i realized that my baby is now a toddler and his toys are all ... well baby toys ! i browsed the toy aisles for the perfect , age apporpriate replacements hating to spend more money on more plastic , yet desperate for anything that will engage him for at least 15 minutes and keep him still so i can put clothes away , vacuum , sometimes just sit and play . this does it ! reliable duplo/lego quality . non frustrating because the pieces actually stay together . easy assembly . of course my little guy is 22 months so i still have to do the majority of the assembly . i did get this for him at age 19 months and by now he has caught on as to how to put the track together . he tries to put the cars together but still needs my help to lock the pieces in place . i am constantly amazed at how much toddlers pick up by watching grownups , so keep putting this back together while your little one is present . luca does love to disassemble the track and it is a challange keeping it together however , over the last month , persistence has paid off and he has figured out how to re-assenmble his little messes . the assembly is easy enough for him to get it on his own ! these chunky toys accomomodate busy little toddler hands perfectly . this particular set comes with everything necessary for your toddler to `` get to work '' . this set has just enough to busy your toddler without being overwhelming ! this set has satisfied my little guy ( although i did buy him the toby ( he is just so cute ) set too . my older boys take tae kwan do every night and this set is a staple in the karate bag . it definately keeps the younger .0brothers and sisters busy and off the mats . other add-ons are available but right now , this set , and the toby have been just enough ! the price sems high for the seemingly few pieces . i am the first to admit it is difficult to commit to a 25 $ purchase , but as with lego/duplo products , the quality and play/learning value add greatly to the plastic parts making it an excellent purchase ! great grandparent gift ! even a perfect toy to keep at grandparents house !
0	my kids really liked it until it broke the next day . there was nothing we could do to fix it as it had an electronic problem
1	this train table is a nice size , bigger than i expected . it went together easily and is sturdy enough for my grandson 's thomas stuff . it seems to be made as well as what i saw at toys r us for double the price .
1	i bought this item for my husband for xmas and he loved it but once they were all put together they would fall apart fairly easy but other then that they are great i highly recomend this especialy for a husband or son
1	i love this thing i have a verzion 2 and there best freinds and you can go onto tama town and get passwords that unlock items we looked every where for one of these we went target no we went wal mart no until we went to my freinds house and he wanted trade tamas but first i keep it for a ltille while for other tamas get here but i think i will trade cuz this thing rocks
0	this was a gift for my 2 year old last christmas . the screws they provide to put the wheels on are no good . as soon as your child starts `` walk '' his new dog , the wheels completely unscrew , which can be a terrible choking hazzard . we have tried everything to keep them on . plus the leash tore off from around poor spot 's neck , and no type of glue seems to keep it on . i 'm afraid this cute little toy is going into the trash . it was good idea and a cute toy , but not worth the money . you 're better off buying a plastic , already put together one .
1	i bought this cd player for my daughter 's 5th birthday not expecting it to last a month . to my surprise it 's worked wonderfully . she figured out how to operate it pretty easily and she listens to it every night before bed . we 've had it for 6 months now with no problems . my favorite feature is the compartment for the cd 's . it keeps them from being left lying around and getting scratched .
0	while the concept is good , there is no way to securly fasten the blue tubes to the main body , so they keep flying off and need reattaching as each child crawls through at their normal breakneck speeds . i would avoid it to be honest .
0	this is the first time i have been truly disappointed in something i have gotten through amazon , much smaller than it looks in picture , if it was five dollars it would be too much , too late now to do anything for christmas , just not worth it at all ... ... ... ...
0	this vehicle is nothing but junk . it does not move well on the driveway and does not move on the grass at all . my grandson uses his feet to push it which is not what i expected from a $ 100.00 toy . very disappointed . i would like to send it back for a full refund
1	i love the loop to hang elmo up to dry , and my now 14 month old enjoys drawing with the soap crayons , and chewing on them unfortunately . not her favorite toy but enjoyed
1	we absolutely love this wagon ! my 2yr old will ride as long as i want to walk , stop , detour , whatever ... she 's glued ! it is huge on the heavy side . but also huge ( you can carry so much/many children ) w/ great quality durability . i can easily see us w/ this wagon for years to come would suggest it to anyone comparing .
1	i just purchased this redesigned at-st from a local retail store . for the basic price of $ 20 for 244 pieces , this set is well worth the price . i purchased the original at-st years ago and this model far surpasses that one in all ways . it 's larger , much more stable , and has a unique pivoting mechanism which rotates the cab . it was very difficult to get the original at-st to stand upright without falling over ; the 7657 is extremely stable . the original at-st had chewbacca at the controls which was pretty cool . however , not as cool as the at-st driver that has a new helmet and blaster . the only drawback is that his minifig head is flesh colored instead of traditional lego yellow . it took about 20 minutes to put the model together . it was n't very challenging but interesting to see how the rotating mechanism was put together . i would highly recommend purchasing this set . for the low price of $ 20 for such a detailed and complete set , it 's well worth the price . you wo n't be disappointed
1	1 . tape as many jenga sticks together with masking tape on one side to support a favorite picture that you would like to turn into a special puzzle . 2 . have your child find a any picture they would like to turn into a puzzle ( even a favorite photo can work . ) 3 . glue whole picture to opposite side of masked taped jenga . 4 . shellac and allow to dry 5 . use excto knife and cut the picture apart . 6 . remove tape and voila` -- your own hand-made puzzle ! even toddlers can put a 5 piece puzzle of an animal or fruit together and they love creating their own puzzle ! enjoy ! aloha
0	i purchased this for myself and my 7 year old to play with . the screen is way too dark to be able to use at dusk or after , but if in direct sunlight , you ca n't see it either . it 's pretty small ( buttons and screen ) and a little confusing . if you are a person who is using hard earned money to purchase this , then do n't . but if you just want to check it out and be okay with not wanting it later or losing the money you spent , go for it
0	this is fun and a good idea , but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor . it fell apart the first time we had it up , and while you can put it back together , unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds , it is n't worth it . the keyboard itself is fine . the microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it , but the keyboard does . the microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away . i would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead , or if you buy this product , do n't expect to use the keyboard stand for long , but it can work without it
0	leave this one `` on the shelf '' ! ! a `` hotwheels '' product which does n't come with `` wheels '' ! ? ? ? ? ! ! ! who would have thought at $ 25.00 it does n't come with a car and then they have the nerve to make it not work with other hotwheels cars ! ! this is a very annoying junk toy which was such a disappointment to my son christmas morning . i would not have been so disatisfied had i shopped on amazon and got it for the price being offered now -- $ 5.00 ! !
0	this does not work for the coler pixter . there is no port to plug it in
0	my daughter loves the sticker maker but she used the cartridge in one day and still has plenty of stickers left to make and i can not find the refills anywhere . they need to make the refills for these types of toys easier to get . i am to hesitant to buy the bead maker now because of that and i know my daughter would like it but it 's a waste if it 's a one time use and upsets my daughter
1	excellent product ! i really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve . after playing all 50 , you can just start all over again ! fun , fun , fun game ! thanks
1	my children enjoy this playouse . in the summer i had it in the backyard . in the winter , it lives in the basement . i bough acrylic paints to color the interior . this will be their surprise when i put it outside in the summer . it will look like a new playhouse . buy this and enjoy playing with your children
1	she is so cute ! i love the real hair , i 've made loads of crazy designs . also , i made a discovery , if you squeeze her tummy , she cries , falls asleep or says `` i luv you mama ''
1	i found that for the price . this set was great ! it comes with one rascus figure , and one shadow knight . the catapult is very orginal , and powered by a rubber band , i got it to go 3 and a half feet . there were also some improvements in the pieces . for example , the flagpole was less annoying , the weapons were improved , and the head pieces came on and off much smoother . whether you are starting lego castle or are an expert builder , this is great set
1	these days , classic game shows are n't really as popular as reality shows like survivor and american idol . however , with the surprise summer show , game show marathon in cbs , many clssics had the opportunity to breathe a glimpse of new life , like press your luck , match game , and card sharks . another classic which was revised , let 's make a deal . with monty hall 's benchmark into pop culture revisted , many have wondered whether the classic game of trading will ever come back onto television again . thankfully , those who easily own dvd actually do n't have to wait for the show to return . they can just trade in the comforts of their own living room . the let 's make a deal dvd game , recaptures the classic trading that monty hall made popular from the 70 's and 80 's into a great fun game . in this game , monty hall puts traders to the test where you can trade your chances for big nostalgic prizes like classic cars from datsun , and cadillac , to trips and fur coats from dicker dicker of beverly hills . on top of that , there are classic quick deals to play for extra cash . for example , if you have a pair of scissors , monty will give you $ 700 . also , there are the classic booby prizes , zonks ! ! ! although they are fun to receive , you get absolutely nothing to show for it . there is also the anticipation of getting the big deal for big bucks . unlike dvd editions of shows like family feud and the price is right , the game really delivers a great job from monty , and each of the great concepts from the classic game show . the mastering really thrives with classic clips of carol merill and deal 's announcer jay stewart on each of the prizes . although i just wish there could 've been more games to play , i am absolutely impressed with the way let 's make a deal was put into a dvd game . if you have n't seen this classic game show , monty hall hosted , you have to buy this great game . i absolutely recommend this , and that is definitely not a zonk ! price : b 1/2- dvd mastering : a- fun enjoyment : b 1/2+ overall : b
0	i am disappointed because this is a really flimsy toy . the launch button does n't push most of the time ( so superman does n't launch ) and the foam superman tears easily .
0	i was very excited to give this to my 8 year old pokemon addict . the toy is very cheap - comes in attached plastic and needs to be assembled . when assembled the wing breaks off constantly and the tail does n't stay together . junk !
0	i have bought two of these toys for my son , an only child and pretty gentle on toys . it has been kept in his bedroom away from his playgroup . he has not even played with it regularly . yet both times these toys broke within months of purchase ! ! ! yes , it is fascinating . and like other reviewers , i 've also had some fun with it myself . but i am disgusted that it broke down so easily -- twice . there must be a reason that amazon does n't offer new ones for sale ; please think hard about buying a new one elsewhere . unless you do n't mind looking at the $ 30 you 'll pay as a month or two of entertainment , look to other gear toys that do n't depend upon this lousy motor .
1	dond is a fun game , and we 've had some lively sessions playing it . there is an additional ( we forget ... we got rid of it ! ) ... complicated thing that the game had , and made it `` less fun '' to play . you also have to disregard the 'suggestion ' regarding `` how '' to give an banker 's offer ... it does n't work , so you have to use your own judgement , to `` jiggle it '' ... actually , this makes it even more fun ! all-in-all ... from 6 to 60 , of we whom have played ( if you follow the 'disregard ' suggestions ) ... it 's a 4-star fun .
0	this is a very cheaply made reproduction of malfoy 's wand . whether you buy it or not probably depends on who it 's for . it would be great for a very small kid who will lose or break it , as it 's cheap and made of plastic . however for anyone else who craes about detail and feel , you might as well be waving around a wooden dowel
0	my daughter just about flipped when she received this toy as a birthday gift ! so immediately after the party , my husband went aboutputting it together . my five year old played with this for all of about 30 seconds before a piece came off . we 've had it for about two weeks now , and every time you touch this thing , some peice comes off . no one plays with it . it 's just too much of a hassle to keep together . my advice - but something else
1	most old skool fans are angry he 's not a vw beetle anymore . i kinda never liked beetles anyway , so im happy with the new unlicenced thing . it looks like a mix of a mini and a peugeot . he transforms better than most , the picture does'nt do him justice , it makes him look stiff . actually , for how bulky he is , he 's amazingly bendable , i particularly like that his `` door/shields '' are'nt attached to his arm , their on a cuffling that rotates so they wont be too awkward like many of the others with `` door/shields '' . the jetski jetpack adds an unneeded extra flair to an already awesome robo mode . and as an extra retro touch it has a tempurture sensitive decal on his chest/top of the car that must be held for a minute before it will reveal the autobot logo [ just like his original 80s version ] . i do wish he had come with some sort of weapon , but i have a few other transformers from this same generation that do n't really need both that they came with . what 's even more awesome for me is that i bought this at the grocery store , as one of the very few toys they had in thier christmas section , for $ 10 if your looking for just any one good transformer , bumblebee is a good choice . if you have optimus , this one looks great standing beside him . transformer fans do n't delay , pick this one up ! i ca n't wait to see movie 's camaro bumblebee in july
1	my cousin loves these dolls . she loves that she gets to be a `` little mommy '' to a boy and girl ... that 's what i love about this set ... plus the dolls are adorable and the only thing i do n't like about them is the hats . i wish the hats were ... cuter ? i do n't know but it does n't matter . i 'd buy these dolls for any really little girl . she used to cry when she lost accessories for her other dolls ... but at least with these there is n't much to lose
1	my daughter is one and a half , and she 's had these blocks for about a year now , but only now is she really playing with them and identifying the little pictures . some pictures are a little obscure , but all the basic animals and objects seem to be covered . i 'm very pleased with how smooth the blocks are , and how well they are holding up . i feel they will really help my daughter to learn her letters , both in upper and lower case . my only problem is with the tray . it only holds the blocks if you keep it completely flat ( as if a toddler can transport anything while keeping it level ) . i also do n't like its sharp edges . my daughter went through a phase where she liked dumping the blocks out and then waving the tray around . now the tray is stored out of reach and the blocks are stored in a small plastic bin
1	both of my kids have a leappad and several books ... this is a great way to keep them all together . it 's durable and kid friendly -- so they can keep track of their cartridges and books ... and it 's great b/c they can just grab it and go which makes it nice for travel too
1	my 21 month old daughter received baby pooh for christmas and plays with him every day . she loves diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change , and bathes with him nightly . he comes with a duckie and bottle of his own . the high chair back does not stay attached to the chair , but pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my daughter . pooh is made from hard plastic and , sadly , his arm broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend . my daugher is handling the trauma ok , but we are getting her an new pooh for her birthday because she loves him so much . i recommend it
1	our family loves this game and has played it for years . the tiles on this version are smaller than the original and some might find them difficult to handle . if you like scrabble , you will love this game !
1	we have enthusiastically played candy land with each of our three kids . it is easily the best starting point for introducing a child to board games . players take turns drawing from a deck and moving their pieces around the board . the cards have one or two squares of a particular color ( such as red , green , yellow , etc . ) and players move pieces ahead on the path to the next matching spot of the same color . no counting or reading is required . there are also special cards that can move a player ahead or behind , and they are indicated by picture of the spot on the board to which the player should move their piece . play continues until one player reaches the end . some of my observations : 1 ) most kids can probably start playing and enjoying this game before the recommended 36 months of age . if you have a child with the attention span and the desire to sit down for a 10-15 minute game , i 'm pretty confident they could enjoy it . 2 ) among the lessons our kids learned from candyland : taking turns , recognizing colors , and dealing with disappointment . luckily , the games are quick enough that it is usually possible to play multiple games in one seting . this makes it possible to keep playing until each child has had at least one win . ( very helpful for managing little egos ) 3 ) for such a simple game , it manages to perfectly balance the possibility of changes in fortune without seeming arbitrary . the game is literally in doubt until the last card is played ( one of the `` special '' cards might send a player back to near the start ) . this is great for teaching that most valuable of lessons : `` never give up '' . 4 ) with most simple games , it is almost impossible to get older kids to play after they reach a certin age . we have not found that to be as true with candy land . we 've had games with an adult and kids ages 3 , 6 , and 9 playing together and having fun . if you have more than one kid , you know how hard this can be . as a parent of three , i give this game my highest recommendation
1	we bought the leappad plus for our 4 year old for christmas and 4 books to go along with it . then i realized we had no where to put it , we also bought the littletouch leadpad for our 1 year old and a bunch of books . yesterday we went and bought this and the carry case for our little one 's littletouch . great space saver . it is made very well too . our daughter calls it her briefcase . it fits everything perfectly
1	i bought this for my children 's room which has an outer space theme . the planets are nicely done and look great . no , they do n't glow in the dark all night long ... but who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways ? ! ? ! they certainly glow long enough for both of my boys to fall asleep ! we have a round ceiling light which i put triangular `` rays '' around which is now our sun . i 'm giving this 4 stars only because i agree about the sticker stars ... yeah ... they kinda stink . but , the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars are easy to find ( i 've even seen them in pharmacy 's ) and inexpensive . we put up 2 packages of the plastic ones and added the sticker stars from the package . it gives the effect of stars which are closer and farther away ! !
1	damn ! i just got the yostick and took it to the local gym and streets to demo some new tricks . at first i had some doubts about the durability of it but after some heavy duty urban testing , it 's still mad tricking . in other words , i 've been trying pretty hard to break it . for it 's price , the yostick is incredible fun . in an age of pricey video-games , $ 10.99 is not a high price for something that provides exercise , fun and an introduction to the movement and breathing rhythms of martial arts . a value-priced training tool , not a toy at all . the movement required by the yostick will help martial arts beginners have fun while learning precise hand-eye controls . the ends are fitted with rubber tips making it a joy to trick directly off the ground . looking forward to collecting other models . enjoy it
1	this is an awsome ship ! well at least anakins is . my cousin has a green anakin jedi starfighter and i want to get the new obi-wan kenobi one that is coming in september . the only thing that is not good about it is that there is a little opening in the cockpit that anakin 's hand ( the green ship comes with an anakin that has a normal hand and one holding a lightsaber ) fell through
0	great concept , but bad design . both of my children have had one for a year . due to the discomfort , they never use it ! it needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around
0	the pieces of this toy ( the outfits , etc . ) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet . also , the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing . in general , this toy is hokey and cheap . i recommend melissa and doug 's magnetic dress-up and/or magnetic princess dress-up . all the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together . also , the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized .
1	great game ! bright , colorful , easy for preschoolers to play and understand . this one rates right up there with winnie the pooh for the 3-5 age group .
1	this is sooooo cool the fashons do smell like fruit ! ! ! ! polly looks sooo sweet ! and what it its ana ! ! ! ! ! lisin buy this it comes with ana ! ! ! ! ! ana is rare ! ! ! ! ! ! wow ! it comes sooooooooooo much outfits ! ! you can get it at toys r us or target or was it walmart ? ? ? oh well get it now ! i also have the one with lea and lilla get both they are sooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! gota go now ! bye love jackie age ... you should no by now ! ! ! ! ! ! : ) : ) :
0	santa got this castle for my five year old son for christmas . i agree with many of the other reviewers , though it is visually appealing it is very flimsy and was painstaking to put together . despite all that my son seems to be enjoying . this toy is fun for the child but not for the parents .
1	i love anything barbie , anything pink , and anything that supports the susan g komen foundation . this doll is all of those wrapped up in one neat package . i am thinking about giving them to my female relatives for christmas
1	this is a great and unique product to encourage creativity as well as physical fitness .
0	unfortunatley , i am not very techno savvy . i purchased this thinking we could use it on the original hyperscan unit ... wronge . my boys told me otherwise , when they opened up the unit and hooked it up , this , being ben 10 , and the original unit being x men , did nothing . i felt so bad for my son , he loves ben 10 and could not even use these cards
0	i bought this for my daughter when she was 2 . i agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product . it is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over . i still let my daughter play with it but only when she 's being supervised around it . and i have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground . there are other good shape sorters out there - i would n't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard .
1	this is a great house , got it at toysrus , has six ring tones at doorbell , dog , knock knock , jibberish , fog horn , etc. , it 's so easy to assemble.all you need is a helper ( to enjoy assembly ) and a power or ratchet screwdriver ( you need both ) the stove is a little tricky to start but once you start the hole you can use a power drill ! your child will love it.swinging door/window , spongebob chair fits inside ( you can probably get a big screen tv in there ! ) great for the price $ 129.0
1	our three children , who are now in their forties , were young when we purchased a bozo bop bag for them . they loved it , used it all the time , and it held up beautifully through the years . now our daughter has a daughter of her own and we purchased one for her . same design , same wonderful quality , same use as forty years ago . bozo is a `` friend '' who likes to be punched so he can bounce back up . our 3 year old grand daughter loves him . she now has a baby sister 7 months old who will also be able to make use of bozo . for toddler activity and appropriate `` acting out '' , i thoroughly recommend this product with no reservation . it 's a bit pricey , but worth 5 stars for sure
0	i was really upset when i received this item . i had ordered 2 becasue i thought it was a terrific deal , but nowhere did it mention that you needed the leappad player in order to use it . i hate returning things =
0	at first the case seemed like a good idea , but after the third use the zipper stopped working . because the case does not stay open on its own , there is a tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart . after fixing it a couple of times , it is now permanently broken . bad design . perhaps velcro would have been better here .
1	this is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year . if you can find it anywhere i would highly recommend it . it plays pre-programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback . the microphone is nice for aspiring american idols ( like my daughter ! ) and it really is pretty . we did lose the dancing cinderella with prince charming , but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played . it also does a pretty light show . i can not give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3-6 year old girls
0	this game is educational because u r asking question`s to other peopleand if thier wrong they hear the anwser anyway so i think u should buy this game because it will teach ur kids alot.i wish all u parents and children good luck
0	twice i gave this board game as a gift this holiday season , and my own 5-year-old daughter received it as a gift . while the idea of the game seems good , there seems to be some misleading print on the box . it indicates that the prinesses will be getting ready to meet prince charming at the ball , but there is no prince charming included in the game pieces -- much to the dismay of my daughter ! my biggest complaint about this game , however , is with the gowns and accessories the princesses wear as they move about the board . the straps of the dresses are very thin , and my daughter has broken three of the four gowns . she has also broken two crowns and the strap on one purse . my daughter plays with the rubber polly pocket things as well , and she has not torn/ripped any of those items , which makes me think the crowns and gowns items are n't made as strongly
0	oh my gosh-this is terrible ! my husband and i bought this game because i loved watching this as a child . this game uses the same prizes and games over and over . if you played once you have played too many times . the games are boring , the prizes are boring and it is a waste of money and time . i do n't know why the box says `` 13 and up '' because my 10 year old daughter could play this . this one is going back to the store-i got zonked out of my $ 24.99 ... if you want my opinion take the cash and run
1	this is the ultimate in home laser tag fun . it has great range and accuracy for hours of exciting but harmless fun . get your kids away from the tv games and into the real ( figuratively speaking ) thing . if you have , two kids make sure you but at least 4 guns . once you receive them , you 'll experience the need for the two extra guns . everyone who sees them will want to play . great toy , thanks amazon .
1	my son received this one as well as the other colorfelt toy . he was not impressed with it in regards to playing with it on his own . it does work well for teaching and using it as a toy that we can play together .
0	this `` game '' is so disappointing . my nephew loves spiderman . he needs fun and subtle cues to stay engaged . he was so excited to get this his first lmax cartridge we could barely get the box open fast enough . we popped it in and had to wait until the commercials or very long intro completed . then we had to blindly navigate through the screens to get to games . they were not intuitive and then thud . he lost interest and has not returned to the lmax since . what an absolute waste of money .
0	these were a gift to my 5-year old from his grandmother . i ca n't return it to her since it would make her feel worse than the worthless product . i 'm amazed amazon carries them ! a string and two cans would work better
1	you can purchase this item at most any walmart or k-mart etc ... for $ 4.99 or cheaper..toywiz is ripping people off ! ! !
0	the first time i `` flew '' the chicken it flopped 2 feet in front of me . the second time it went about 6 feet . the third time it decapitated ! i was left with a piece of stuffed chicken in each hand . unless you are accomplished at disassembling and reassembling stuffed animals , it is not repairable . save your money for something else
1	my infant just likes the crinkly fishy that comes with the buckets . i 'm sure she will grow into this toy . i do wonder how i 'm going to keep the felty material clean especially when she starts putting these things to her mouth .
0	i bought this gift for my daughter for christmas . it does not work at all . it sounds like a cheap transistor radio when you attempt to adjust the knobs . i 'd like my money back
1	i enjoy playing with this toy and it trains me to be a good mom . your tamagotchi 's appearance depends on how you care for it . mine turned into mametchi . mametchi is a really good character to have . i have enjoyed this toy so much . you should definately buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	i bought this doll w/ brunette hair for my 4 year old . it 's so soft and realistic looking , floppy like a real newborn , perfect weight for little ones to cradle . i 'd been looking for a 'baby ' doll w/ long hair - some of the other co 's make them too heavy , not conducive for real play . this doll is also washable , a big plus . the hair is soft and very brushable , the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly . a little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features . overall a very nice doll , high quality , hopefully will be played w/ for many years .

1	my 16 month old loves her new groceries . the produce & amp ; amp ; sandwich parts are plastic & amp ; amp ; each piece has a wonderful texture . the canned goods are very interesting to read . they are actually labeled by a supermarket in the uk , so they are a bit different from the groceries you would find in the us . i put the cardboard frozen food items away until she is older . she has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate . this was a great purchase .
0	looks great , but not worth the money . my son begged for this toy - and it was a big dud . almost impossible to fly - i think once out of 50 tries were we successful . made out of flimsy material , it chipped and scraped right away . do not buy this toy ! ! ! ! !
0	a torture device disguised as a toy . how would you like to spend all day playing on the stairwell ? might as well go lick some dirty socks . i think my dog actually used to drag its bottom along the stairs to relieve a recurring rash . hey , ma , why does slinky go down but not up ? who 's the genius who found this at the scrapyard ? most toys in the 1970s relied on mankind 's perverse craving for repetition and/or irritation
1	i thought this product was very unique . it 's not as advanced as ipods which , is great for younger kids . although , the only thing i did n't like was that it was a bit too small
1	we purchased a starter piece set for my girl when she was 3 years old . she absolutely loved it because it was easy to use and build . she had a hard time with the legos type blocks because it was more frustrating for her to pull them apart . we then expanded to this 35 piece and she is able to be even more creative . it is an excellent lerning toy . not as simple as it seems
1	my 14 mo old son just got his go kart today . he loves it . he loves pushing the button and making it go . he has n't figured out the steering yet but we have a long straight entry way to our home so no need to steer yet . my 4 yr old daughter also loves it and fits into it just fine ( about 40 in tall and 35 lbs ) . she received the razor go kart herself and loves it but that one is outside only . they have had the best time today playing with the pw go kart . i agree with other reviewers that holding down the button is hard for little ones but they figure out ways to get around it . ( the razor go-kart also has a thumb throttle control ) we got the lil quad 4 wheeler for my daughter when she was one and would still ride it if she did n't have the big 4-wheeler . now both kids can ride their 4-wheelers together or their go karts . thanks santa for 2 great gifts
0	this seemed to be well put together and would do the job fine except it was not stated anyware that i saw as to the weight the zip line was for . rated at only 100 pounds was not enough of a weight limit for this child . this information should be published in the advertisment
1	i bought this as a halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004 . he loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house . he does n't really use it much anymore , but now my 18 month old loves it ! he can actually follow the whole progression , turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time . this toy has been great for our family . it is pretty durable , some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore , but considering what it has gone through , it has performed amazingly well
1	i appreciate the previous reviews , but we had already gotten the game by the time i read them . my family - ages 4 , 6 , 10 and three adults playing really enjoyed this game . we played until we had a winner ( not too long ) and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner . just our opinion - but we had a good time
0	i helped my five-year old assemble this , and , like most lego directions , it went together well ... unfortunately , it does n't stay together ... when he tries to play with it , the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle ... not as easy to put back together once it 's come apart ... it 's proven a real disappointment..
0	it 's christmas day , and believe me , the only thing that would get me to sit down at a computer is the level of dissatisfaction i 've had with the thomas battery powered engines . these trains derail constantly . i think it is because all four wheels have power , and the front wheels have too much traction , so they are able to climb out of the grooves . took me all night to set up a really cool track , and they derail every 40 seconds or so . read : 3 year old yelling at train . thank goodness i also bought a brio battery powered engine as well ( the polar express one ) . it works much better . it has not derailed once all morning . it also is better in the following ways : 1 ) it shuts off after 2 minutes so you do n't lose battery power , 2 ) it can go into freewheel mode when you want to use it without power , 3 ) it goes in reverse , 4 ) it makes train sounds , 5 ) the coupling to other cars has a swivel which means it is less likely to derail and more likely to maintain the magnetic connection , 6 ) it comes with batteries installed . if `` santa claus '' had not disposed of all the packaging last night , i would return all the battery operated thomas trains and go with brio ones . note : there is a good thomas battery powered car which is the jet engine . this jet engine has the swivel , and seems not to derail , maybe because it pushes the other cars in front of it
0	i bought this for my pony-obsessed daughter for christmas , mostly because it was the only way to get the breezie `` zipzee '' ( one of the main breezies in the new movies ) . thank goodness i was n't expecting much out of this toy after reading reviews on the other playsets , because it did n't even last a day ! after i assembled the `` braiding '' handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself , she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart . not the handle you snap on , mind you . that was still firmly attatched . the rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it ! fortunately she gets enough use out of zipzee and daffidaisy that it was n't too much of a loss that i had to throw it away only hours after opening the box . so , unless you 're really after zipzee or daffidaisy , do n't waste your money on this junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for younger siblings . horrible ! !
1	i bought this for christmas for my three children ages 4 ( twins ) and 18 mos . although the younger child does n't really get the games we play with it , the older ones do and we all have a great time . my goal was to get them to be active during the winter ( less tv time ) , and this works for about 30 minutes . i only wish we had a bigger house so i could have gotten the bigger parachute . i ca n't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm
0	i picked this up on clearance , but i still think i spent too much . the older versions were made of much sturdier material ; the cards the questions are printed on are very flimsy compared to the original game . the questions are okay , but many are very obscure . trivial pursuit is a great game and it 's one of my favorites , but this version is a dud . save your money if you have the older version ; it 's still a lot more fun to play
1	the fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child . she had a great time using her `` magic wands '' to see what would happen . with the bathroom playset , having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool ( i assume so dora could step up to the sink brush her teeth ) pops out was a very fun surprise . my 7 year old has already spent many hours making up princess stories with the castle . the whole set was a great buy
0	the doll is ok , not as good as one expect after seeing it online . anyway , for 6 $ ( including shiping ) is worth
0	i am now the laughing stock of my friends , why because i payed money for the lamest excuse of a 8 bit console tv plug and play ever . my atari plug and play has better graphics and feel than this . there are bars that have the projected gtee screen that makes the game all most real i feel my little tv had to much resolution for this toy making it feel not so real in fact in two words `` it sucks '' .
0	this game is one hot mess . i bought it for my mom for christmas . we decided to play the 2 player game thinking it would be fun . well , the word my mother used to describe it is `` excruciating '' . this was the slowest and most boring thing i 've ever played . there is at least a 10 second pause between each function ( choosing a case , opening the case , howie giving you directions , taking turns , looking at your opened case . . .you name it ) . each time you switch back to the other player , the screen literally goes black ! you only see the suitcase girls in the beginning and the end . when a case is opened , you only see two arms , breasts and the case ! when it is your turn to pick a case , there is complete silence as you scroll - and i use the term loosely - up and down to pick a number . for a `` video game '' which you assume to move quickly , you 'd better set aside at lease an hour to play it . you will be exhausted when you 're through . we suggest they go back to the drawing board and stop with all the pauses , play some theme music when you are choosing your case , show the girl who opens your case , have the audience clap - anything ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you buy this game , you only have yourself to blame . p.s . i won $ 750,000 and did n't even care , i was just glad it was over
1	easy to follow instructions for set-up and play , very intuitive . the only thing i would suggest is to make sure the young folks have an 'elder ' playing on their team , to have a shot at the questions on old people , events , etc . if they 're real sports history buffs , then it 's not an issue
0	very disappointed with the quality . took 2 hours to put together then disintegrated as i was carrying it from the shop to the christmas tree . i was not happy having to put it back together early christmas morning . be prepared to use extra tape , glue , nails and screws to hold the contraption together . the stairway is a joke and i threw it away as it is only held in with two 3/4 '' pegs . we 'll see if it survives christmas day .
1	this angel is sure to be a gem in any collectors collection . she is elegant and graceful . her gown in beautiful as well as her spiral curled hair . she is adorned in a golden head chain . she has a chain sash which is also part of her gown . at last she is given beautiful golden wings and holds a bouquet of flowers . this one will definately be worth the value in the years to come
1	this set was one of the most fun builds i 've done with lego in a long time . as an adult fan of lego , i highly recommend this set for its minifigures and part selection . they are excellent additions to any castle or general builder . as a builder , the final construction is impressive in size ( 18+ inches long ) , functionality ( the rotisserie chicken is quite amusing ) , and playability ( the sea serpent 's posability and the incredible catapult alone are stunning ) . the catapult was my favorite part . after seeing the necrotic firing action of the lego exo-force mobile defense tank 's disk launcher ; the rapid-fire , long-range viking catapult is astonishingly fun to play with . the lone drawback in this set is the fragility of the ship 's hull . it should be assembled on a hard surface ( i tried to build it on carpet ) and slid about on the floor , not carried ( it will fold in half in the air ) . a few extra plate elements to reinforce the hull joints would probably improve this set
0	i loved the concept of the markers . however they have left a greasy stain on my daughters clothing ! ! the package said that they did n't stain ! i called and they gave me a long process to try and remove including tide with bleach..is that one of their subsidiaries ? i was very disappointed
0	my daughter 's birthday was to take place the next day . at 10pm i went to wal-mart , and after seeing on the package `` over 100 songs , stories , and games '' , i thought this would be awesome ! i bought this toy excited that the doll would actually sing happy birthday the next morning to my 2 year old ! i installed the software on my desktop ( xp machine ) , but the real headache came when i hooked this thing to the computer ( and i am a computer guy , so it should n't be that hard ) . i plugged in the doll with the usb provided cable , and windows xp loaded the update to the drivers for the usb port . i clicked `` download to dora '' , and the system came up with the `` incorrect doll '' that another reviewer mentioned . i tried fisher price 's help files , but it was no help ( in fact , it said call their customer svc department ) . following another reviewer 's instructions to try this on a new computer , i loaded this software on my laptop . hooked the doll in . had windows xp update the usb driver . then with great anticipation i clicked `` download to dora '' ... .and ... ..and ... ..i received `` incorrect doll '' ! finally , at 1am ... i gave up . i took the doll back to wal-mart . she got a nice tri-cycle instead
0	this is a cheaply made , over-priced product . it did n't last a week and i paid over 30 dollars for it and since i ordered it early as a christmas gift - i ca n't return it because it has been over 30 days ! ! the drawer to pull out to get the coin rolls out will not go back in all the way , therefore the coins fall to the bottom , get stuck , etc . total waist of money that i now can not get back !
0	this is a great idea for a great marketing group . . . little kids who want to listen to music `` just like the big kids . '' the fp3 has a few issues of it own , but the speakers were disappointing . the sound quality is not good . even with the volume turned up it is difficult to hear . another huge down fall is that a power cord is not available . . . so you can end up going through batteries pretty fast . to top it all off , my son has difficulty getting the fp3 correctly mounted into the speaker unit on his own . overall we were very disappointed with this accessory
1	i love this doll house and all its furniture . it was very average no fake looking dolls and i loved the office furniture for the doll house . we have had a lot of fun playing with it including me . it is good for my daughter and i to spend time playing together .
0	i have my own business so i decided to give back to community by assisting with christmas for the unfortunate . i purchased 7 amazing allysen dolls and a plethora of other stuff for the less fortunate . none of the allysen dolls work . i purchased a amazing allysen for my little in cousin in florida also . we tried to make that doll work but it would not . i went to the local walmart to purchase another one and it did not work either . i am totally disappointed with amazing allysen . the kids that i purchased the doll for in raleigh north carolina could not find the appropriate things so that i could return the dolls . i will return the one i purchased for my cousin today because my 30 days are almost up . this was a horrible experience . those kids were expecting to have a super awesome doll , but she did not work . i felt so bad because it was like i had something to do with it because i purchased so many and none of them worked . i did have the opportunity to return the doll to walmart in florida and purchased an amanda doll for my little cousin after christmas . she really loves amanda
1	my one-year-old son had a great time playing with these blocks ... he loved the colors and shapes . he really enjoyed knocking down my block creations . we had such a good time playing with the blocks that i decided to go on-line to buy him some . i was shocked at the price . i can not believe [ what ] these blocks cost ... for thirty-two foam blocks ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! forget it . it 's too bad that these blocks are cost restrictive ; they 're great fun , but not worth the price
1	this eeyore is so much fun . i gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose , but if mom and dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach baby to keep them together , i think there is also something to be learned with this , plus the fact that he is so darn cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing . `` good night baby . '' just precious . baby quickly learns that eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle . i thought the ears would be easy to break , but they have taken a lickin ' from my grandson and still work . nana ka
0	santa brought this item . we opened it several days later and it broke the same day .
0	we bought this for our kids for christmas . of course we open the box on christmas eve at 10pm to put it together and there are no instructions ! it looks easy but without instructions we are not sure about the pins etc . could someone post the phone number of the company so we can call them . tomorrow morning should be interesting ! merry christmas ...
0	we bought this for my daughter for her birthday . like the previous reviewer we also did n't realize we needed to dilute the paint first . even with the paint diluted properly it does n't really work as expected . you have to wait for the paint to drip down to the bottom of the tube and then turn the spinner on . even then only a bit of paint comes out and you have to turn it off and wait for more to drip down . i plan on returning this toy for a refund as well .
1	when i ironed my 14m son wanted to play with it . he helps with the house cleaning . i bought this toy iron that really has an on and off switch , sprays water and pretend buttons . he loves it and pushes it around the carpet like he is ironing the carpet . we `` play '' iron with the water when i have time . this is one toy that i can take anywhere and he stays busy for quite some time . sigrid manon blake - ramire
1	my family of seven kids , four daughters/sons-in-law have owned this game for 2 years . we love playing it and it is one of the few games that everyone enjoys . it is one of our favorite games and that is saying a lot since we own dozens of games . our youngest was 12 when we bought the game and she often wins
0	i purchased the twist shout multiplication for my grandaughter who is 8 years old . she has not put it down since she received it . however mine was malfunctioned and would not give multiple choices . it would only ask the question and then gave the answer . she was hesitant to give it up when i explained i needed to exchange it for another . this is the only toy she has that has held her interest for long periods of time . she nows brags to friends that she knows her multiplication tables
1	my three kids have loved this tunnel since they were two ( they are now 5,7 9 ) they still play with it alot . they do a variety of things with it including magic tricks where the child inside will `` magically '' disappear . it 's great exercise too to be on your hands and knees . they also love to play `` tornado '' with it , where one child gets inside standing up while the others throw stuffed animals into it , meanwhile the child inside throws them back outlike a real tornado does
0	our boys had a good time with this toy , but after a 5-6 launches it broke ! not just the wings but the plastic body . i feel like it was a waste of money and over priced
0	i wish i 'd read the reviews before buying this product ! i would have saved us money and aggravation . i bought these for my son 's christmas present this year . he was really excited about playing with them with his sister . the problem is , we have n't been able to find one single spot -- inside or out -- where we can get reception on both units ! even when you can pick up one person on the handset , the sound is so staticky and crackly , that you can barely make out what the person is saying . what 's the point ? my kids got so frustrated in the first couple of days , that they dumped them in the toybox and have n't played with them since . what an incredible waste of money and such a let down for the kids on christmas . it 's pretty rotten that national geographic can conscience putting this piece of junk on the market . do n't make my mistake . heed these reviews ! this is a must-avoid product
0	as in my title i have mixed feelings about this toy . my children both have the original color version of the videnow . i thought i would upgrade them to the newer version . they have a cheap feel to them and do n't seem to work very well . in fact one is going back to the store next week for a trade in . there is a lock botton that freezes the bottons so you ca n't accidently turn off while watching . but it seems like the buttons freeze up on their own quite often . i can see why the batteries go dead quickly because if a child ca n't turn off the unit it just gets left on ! i am very dissapointed in this . the kids really enjoyed their color versions and i feel i should n't have gone to the extra expense to upgrade them . however , even with it 's faults my kids still enjoy them . my kids do n't watch a lot of tv and prefer the shorter pvds to the long dvds . i prefer that too . that way i can say they can watch one show and know they wo n't be watching for an hour or more . if you are a parent thinking about purchassing one- keep you receipt in case you need to exchange and carefully think about how your kids will be using it . if your child is easily dissapointed by items that may not work properly this may not be the item for you
1	this set is perfect for my daughter 's new toy oven ( miele ) that she received for christmas . the pots and pans are sized just right and the utensils are fit perfectly with the pots and pans . one of my utensils already broke apart , but that happens . i have a 3 year old girl who loves to cook , but she is 3 and is not always careful . not sure whether that utensil was n't made well enough or it 's a 3 year old 's play , but the rest of the set seems fine . i would recommend this and the miele oven
1	this product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the uk as a great teaching tool . it was well received as a gift by the children and their parents . an excellent math teaching tool that the children love . it is portable , user friendly and has something for those on many different levels , so much so that one father , an engineer , loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son , as well as a game that they can play together . math whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge
0	my twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3 . they loved it ! ! ! the dog is so cuddly and cute . they loved playing pretend with the accessories . my only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off , the syringe was coming apart , and the brush had lost a couple of bristles . the boys had not played rough with it , it just was n't the quality that i had hoped for . it is a real favorite of theirs , i am just afraid that it wo n't last as long as their imaginations . i think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy . a real winner for young children in the hospital .
0	without my husband being handy , this would have been in the trash on dec 26th . took almost 2 hours to assembly with these small wooden pegs that barely held the unit together . it fell apart when my daughter was playing with it on christmas day and so my husband improvised with stronger screws to hold it together . though she loves playing with it - we need to find out where we can purchase the furniture that the picture shows ? ?
1	i bought this for my nephew 's first birthday and my sister told me that he loves it . when he gets up from a sleep it is the first thing he wants to play with and with him being at the stage where he is trying to stand up ; it is a great motivator to encourage him to stand . your kids will love this toy and the sounds and lights will keep your child amused for hours
1	i received the order in record time and in excellet condition . saved time from trying to find it in a store loacally , and arrived right at my door step . really cool item , my son loves it
1	my toddler ( 22 months ) loves this doll . there 's something about his wide open mouth and little round nose that enchants her . she actually threw over elmo for ernie . i never thought i 'd see the day . ernie is carried all around with her , and the nose gets lots of kisses . great toy for girl or boy fan of sesame street
1	this is a nice toy for kids to ride on . my daughter loves the little horn . there are some little figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music . that does not work well at all . there are also little toy holders for the figuerines but those never get used either . it 's a cute riding toy but a lot of the features do n't work well . worth the buy if a family is really into the john deere theme
0	i bought this dollhouse for my daughter 's 3rd birthday . within the first week i had to glue at least 3 pieces of furniture back together . over the past year i 've repaired numerous pieces and the house can not be moved without the back and roof coming off . ( it is now taped together ) . for $ 150 and with all of it 's `` awards '' i expected much better quality . i think alex needs to stop selling this house and redesign it
0	i should have bought my girls ipods . yes , these mini-muddles are cute in that they fit into little girl purses and pockets , but that 's where the novelty ends . first , it is not abundantly obvious to children how to work the controls to get where they want to be . these are kids for crimy sakes ! they needs to have controls that are clear and easy . my youngest has no idea how to get to a particular song because the buttons never do what she thinks they should do ( that 's a big hint to hasbro ... do n't design a product from an adults point of view . design it for a child from their point of view . a button having multiple functions is very confusing for kids ) . so i end up having to constantly mash those itty-bitty buttons until i can figure out where the song is for her . second , the process of getting music from point a to point b ( point b being the mini-black-hole ) is not a quick and easy process . copy here , burn there , transfer to this spot , drag/drop to who knows where . oy vey . and then you discover the music is n't in the correct format so you have to start all over again . as for the 128 worth of space ... 128 is a piddly amount of space but it is clearly advertised on the packaging that this is the amount you 're going to get . no surprises there . now if i could only get the darn music into the player without giving up and chuckin ' it to the dog to play with . an ipod might be expensive , but apple certainly does n't cause this consumer the grief and frustration that hasbro has
0	again , the graphics are horrible , the mat is boring and not colorful . my 3 1/2 yr old had a hard time matching the colors on the tv to the ones on the mat b/c they are so faded . she used it once and it has been sitting in the corner ever since ... complete waste of money
1	my granddaughter loves the buckets . they are large and easy for little hands to pick up . they make great hats and are great for putting things in as well as for the coordination of putting them on top of each other . the colors are bright and the plastic is sturdy . a great gift for little ones and older ones as well .
1	i bought this for my niece and it arrived within a few days in great condition . it was still in its original box and it was n't dented or anything .
1	my daughters ( ages 5 and 2 1/2 ) were given these dolls for christmas . they love them and play with them every day , especially the 5-year-old . i think the littlest one may be a little too young to really enjoy her fully , but she plays with her when her big sister plays with hers . i 'm glad i did n't let some of the reviews discourage me from getting these . all the problems people are having with the limited english can be very easily remedied , if they read the directions fully . first of all , you must switch the doll from `` display '' mode , by moving the little switch on her back . the doll comes in the mode used so that people can try her out in the store . in this mode , she will only say one or two things in english . one you move the switch , you just have to `` wake her up '' and hold the button util she 's speaking english . from that point on , she should speak english , even after waking up . however , if you turn her completely off via the back switch , you will have to switch her back to english by holding the bracelet down . i really have not had a problem , and certainly do n't have to spend time interpreting what she 's saying . that 's why they make directions - it tells about the display mode right on the front
1	awesome music and interaction ... fun storage compartment under seat and blocks that fit into the sides and play wonderful songs . gets the kiddo very involved . transitions well from indoor toy to riding outside
0	no wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks , it does not work and the quality is sub par . i have three boys so we get alot of hotwheels toys and this one is the worst i have seen . do not take if it was free . garbarge and disappointment await . i gave one star because you have to , but i would give negitive stars if i could
1	murdoch is a mighty engine with ten drive wheels . he was brought to the island to help with the heavy workload and pull freight on the main line . as shy as he is strong , murdoch can often be found seeking peace and quiet . this wooden train is a 2 piece set , joined with magnets . my son loves playing with this mustard-yellow engine on his wooden tracks . very sturdy construction , and a great addition to the thomas line
1	this is a very good webkinz as the plush and as the virtual pet . it comes with a rare tv and other supplies . it is also very soft . the only bad thing is the price . do n't buy webkinz online , the price can go up to $ 50 . the real price is $ 11.99 , which you can find them for that price in stores
0	our daughter has had this product for quite some time and sad to say she hasnt touched it much at all . this product does get alot of attention but it is more so with reassembly . it does not swing , it does not stay together . i am constantly putting the legs back on and setting it back up and placing it with my daughters lil corner of little mommy playthings . of all the items collected , this one seems to be the one with the most problems . we do have a variety of brands varying in price from cheaper to more expensive . this one is by far the worst product we have yet purchased for her collection . we have very few dolls that actually fit in the swing and the ones that do , are too small for it . it is also the smallest item my daughter has for her dolls that range in size . we will not purchase another of these as well as recommend others to not purchase one . if the price is too good to be true , then you will only get what you paid for
1	we bought our youngest son the pirate ship seven years ago when he was four . he is now eleven , and is asking for this new updated ship . he has played with the old one for years , outside in the pool , inside , along with the big king castle , and countless other sets that we have . yes , playmobil . is delicate , and young children can be taught how to play with it , there are alot of small pieces , but like lego , it will and does encourage a child 's imagination , rather than stifle it . we have castles , western forts , city sets , boats , all of it ! it does take time to put together , but some of the best memories are of me and my boys putting together some of these intricate playmobil sets the day after christmas ! when you buy toys for your kids , do n't look at a toy and say `` what does it do '' , rather look at a toy and ask `` what can my child do with this toy '' ? playmobil has been one of the toys that my three boys have stayed with along with legos well past christmas , much more , than anything else . i am keeping all of our collections for our grandchildren .
1	the `` shout about '' line of dvd games are a great way of getting people together . we play teams ( at least 3-5 people on each ) and it is always a noisy and fun crowd .
1	what more can you say ? it 's durable , it 's fun , it folds so nicely and be put away ! good buy
0	not worth the buy . very hard to use in the pool . vendor delivery service was great
1	this pony has proved ( along with the princess promenade ) to be one of the most popular of the my little pony 's we have bought . it comes with a pink skirt , a pink crown and high heel shoes . the most popular item was the dressing table with revolving mirror and after several months it still has n't broken despite harsh treatemnt . the pony is white with silver strands through the mane and tail . it was very pretty but the rough treatment really does make the mane matted very quickly . also , think about getting white pony 's very seriously for younger children , while the coloured ones can be drawn on with pen and the stains wiped off and at least partly concealed - on white ponys it is impossible to hide . for the younger ones ( 3 year olds ) it is hard to get them not to at first . desert rose was very pretty but is now a bit stained and sorry looking . never the less she is integral in my children 's games still which is nice . one of the more popular ponies we have bought . generally very hard wearing , including the accessories , the only item which has been broken is the crown which did n't last - it was too thin and got badly bent early on
1	this lovely new set depicts one of america 's best-loved and most popular breeds . the beautiful dun mare with her sparkling white blanket was created using the `` duchess '' mold . her alert expression and slightly wind-tossed mane is sure to make her a favorite with your young horse-lover . the sweet dark dun foal has his mama 's lovely blanket and sweet face . created from the classic arabian foal mold , his thin legs make him a bit more fragile than mother . all in all , these two would make a wonderful addition to any little equestrian 's collection
1	we stretched it across our pool but we have a stoper in the line so you fall in the pool . we just used some special clamps and a high compression spring . the kids love it because they can fly right into the pool
1	this is like a real fish the the tub . our little one loves it
0	although my 3 1/2 yr old loves this belt , it barely fits him . it only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go . in fact , my 1 1/2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro . the smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear . also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all , and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face . my son loves it for the brief time it sort-of fits him , but i am disappointed with the quality , and the size
1	it is a very nice product . i bought if for my 1 year old grandbaby to take to nursery with him . i put in pictures of the family so he could look at them with his teachers . my daughter says it very useful , and he is adapting to his nursery quicker .
0	this school bus was smaller than i expected , about 4 inches long . i bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses . he broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package . it 's a pull-back and go car . and he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels . they were wobbly from then on . this toy is not for kids and it 's not really for playing with from what i can tell . very dissappointed
0	actually , we love the game very much but are very disappointed with pressman toys . here 's the scoop : our game came with only 20 pegs of each color -- the box clearly shows at least 40 of each color . we 've called the company 1800 800-0298 x 186 several times but they refuse to send us additional pegs . just bad business practice in my opinion . as the saying goes , when you love something you tell a few people , when you 're not happy you tell everyone . i 'll be sure to check that i 'm not buying items from pressman toys next time . so instead of returning the game and paying for shipping we 'll just have to win in fewer steps . sigh !
0	we bought this for my son for christmas , on the conditon that he never put fish in it , since the reviews said it killed fish . that worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival . of course it had to go in with the sharks . so with freshly treated water and a prayer , we put the fish in . the next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom . after checking the reviews , i saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered . so we 've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive . i still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights , but it 's very noisy and i believe it kills fish
0	do n't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs . we bought the bratz one it thought it was a pawz when we took it online . after 10 or so total hours ( yes , i know what i 'm doing ) fighting it i gave up took it back . tech support is a joke . there 's nothing in the manual or online help , only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time , and none of those responses addresses the issue .
0	a great idea , in theory , but i think this is a very poor design . the wing nuts do not tighten sufficiently to hold the strings in place - they just spin around and around . i will be able to get it working , with a bit of work and a few bits and pieces from around the house , but if i had given this to a child for christmas i would feel awful about it..
1	but i like sasha and jade better . she 's cute though . she has brown hair with blond highlights and big hazel eyes and her beauty mark looks so cute ! her first outfit is a pink tank top with a silver necklace design . her skirt is a strange black , pink , and gold pattern . her shoes are pink with small gold hearts and a yellow `` stone '' in the middle . her second outfit is a black tank top with a silver chandelier design . her jeans are light blue with flower designs and a silver and hot pink fringe over it . her shoes are black mary janes with red designs on them . thanks for reading my review ! hope you enjoy her
0	paint doesnt load or expel easily ... waste of money and time ... my daughter is happier with a bucket of plain water and a brus
1	i bought the african-american 2005 holiday barbie for my little girl . i agree with her statement that `` she 's too pretty to play with ! ! '' . mattel did an amazing job this year . the face on this doll is exquisite . `` miss 2005 '' is absolutely proportionate in classic barbie terms . the gown 's colors definitely put you in a festive spirit . in fact , the ball gown , as a whole , is supernaturally beautiful . picking bob mackie as this year 's designer was nothing short of genius . when i saw that mackie was the holiday designer , i knew that mattel had finally gotten it right !
1	we got this as an 11th birthday present for one of my daughter 's friends . it was the hit of the birthday party -- all the girls went home with new yarn belts , and my daughter , who can already knit a little , asked if she could have one , too . the colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with . for our purposes , this was a great birthday present
1	this toy was an instant success with my son , who is six . he figured out how to put together the track in minutes . unlike other construction toys , skyrail is not limited to one or two designs . my son can create endless configurations , including loop-the-loops that really work . this toy is also easy to disassemble . the track and connectors seem a little flimsy , but so far -- after many , many uses -- none of the pieces has broken
1	you might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 optimus prime toy ( or wanted a trailer for the truck ) , but this is an updated version of the original character , as opposed to a remake , and is superior in many ways . it is durable , detailed , well-articulated , and fun , especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot . i 'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike
1	i was skeptical about this one.. as i have learned that the cheaper the toy is.. the less my baby likes it . though he absolutely adores this floor mat . i got it for him when he was 2 months old . he is only 4 months old now but ca n't get enough of it . the little octopus does make sound when it spins.. but he ca n't reach it yet . though its hilarious to watch him try ! he gets so frustrated and beats up the other toys , but then smiles in the end when i go spin it for him . i give this 5 stars because the floormat itself is . i would give it 4 stars but that is based on my baby and all babies are different . the only problems we have with it , which would make it 4 stars would be the fact that aside from the octopus there are no other sounds , and there are no lights . my baby loves sounds and lights . so if you have one of those , expect yours not to want to play as long on the mat in the beginning stages . ours plays for about 20-30 minutes , then he wants to be moved to his swing so he can look in the mirror and hear the music . but you can get really good tummy time on this and it keeps them entertained and laying out straight ( instead of scrunched up in a swing so often ) so you can get a few things done around the house . oh and we have noticed that our baby will play on it longer , if we go over and play with him every once in awhile . helping him reach the toys , making the octopus spin , etc . then we get another 20 minutes to do whatever . so all in all ... its a great product ... just be warned that the little mirror on one of the fish.. is n't a mirror . its one of those flashy material looking things and the baby ca n't see his reflection in it.. cause i cant even see mine in it . if the toys are hanging to low for your baby , you can flip them over the top bar once and they will hang higher , or move the baby on the mat a bit .
1	this game is great to get to know your friends and family in a new light . it encourages deep converasations but can also be a fun and energetic game . you 'll find yourselves wrapped up in topics that you 'd never discuss otherwise .
0	i received my order today , and discovered ( as with all of the hasa products in my order ) that although more than one item is pictured -- only one comes with the order . the item itself is very small , 2 1/2 '' x 1 '' . that , fine , i can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood , lifesize would make play a work-out for most children . however , shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for one item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising
0	my 7 1/2 year old daughter tried these on at a friend 's house yesterday . she had them on for about 2 minutes before she fell and got hurt . after a trip to the er and the orthopedic surgeon , she has a fracture in her growth plate . need i say more
1	i was really excited when i saw this doll , because i 'm navajo . it 's something i can let my daughters take into school to share during native american month . we all like it a lot
1	i started playing this game in it 's original german version . which , went through some revision as the expansion decks were put out . as a result , the english version may end up being a little more together as you get the expansion decks . talk about a wonderful game to play for two people ! it is absolutely well put together , though certainly different in playing than the boardgame version of catan . it uses the same notions , but has a far more dynamic involvement within the game play itself . the expansion packs are absolutely great , and overall add lots of options and twists to the play of the game . it takes a couple of hours , and a signicant amount of table space . it travels well enough in it 's box , but to actually play it you need time and lots of space . i highly recommend it , especially if you are only two people and looking for a game that you can play that is fun , involving , and certainly full of strategy . this is one of the many wonderful games made by klaus teuber , and i hope he keeps coming up with winners
0	mixed low review- the single biggest negative is the contrast/brightness level of the screen , which makes it near impossible to see except at certain angles and light conditions . unfortunately , that is a huge achilles heal . otherwise , great electronics , features , and stylus operation . i would try to demo this before buying since the screen issue could be a deal breaker ( unless there is something wrong with mine , which i doubt , i would not buy this again
0	the mcqueen car went first . motor sounds worked but no voice and rear wheel activation . this , after about two weeks of play . then the king car stopped working . same thing , no voice or rear wheel activation . the cars that came with the shake 'n go race track are holding up but go through the batterys . the cars have a tough plastic shell and alot of thought has gone into the details . one gets the impression of a quality toy when handeling it and they look good just sitting still . but , that is not what we get them for .
1	we purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size , meaning the food would be closer to `` real '' size rather than miniature . it was . we also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use . that remains to be seen , but the stuff is made well and i can not see it breaking unless you deep-freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer . nice texture , nice flexibility , pretty realistic looks . the child it was intended for ( age 4 and a bit ) plays happily with it , even the older boys ( 10 and 13 ) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it
0	these rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition . however , the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see . after we opened the cards ( two sets were purchased ) , we found that the rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside-down . the cards are also not particularly sturdy . these cards appear to be irregulars
1	all of the peek a blocks are fun . although each set has a different 'theme ' they are very similar and enjoyable to play with . these blocks are great fun . each block has something interesting inside it . in our house these have been played with by boys and pretty roughly at times . the windows to see inside are still clear and not one of these blocks have broken . so i would say they are sturdy and hold up well to normal play . on the ends of each block is a texture . within each block is something interesting . and many blocks have an activity associated with it- push a button to make a noise , twist a knob to make something turn around etc . the one thing i would warn is that these blocks do not stack well , particularly in tall towers . so if you are thinking of buying these for tower building , i 'd consider a different set of blocks . otherwise , these are excellent toys . they provide a basis for communication and vocubulary building with your child . they are sturdy and encourage language , eye hand coordination and so on . if you enjoy toys that are fairly quiet , do more than have a push button to make a noise , foster independent creative play and exploration of the world this is an excellent toy . enjoy .
0	our almost-4 year old son loves dragons and has one of the imaginext dinosaur sets , so we thought we 'd really surprise him on christmas this year with the imaginext dragon set . while i 'm very happy with how happy my son is with it ( he 's been playing with it for hours ) i have a feeling we 're going to be in much the same boat as some other reviewers . pros : - interesting color scheme - good detail on most pieces - re-configurable - the dragon figure is really neat - the trap door , rotating floor and other moving parts are a lot of fun for my son to operate - got it on sale at the local toys r ' us for 11 dollars less than listed on the web site . cons - the directions are picture-only , and much too small to see fine detail . - the pieces are not packaged together logically , so that the elements of the set are all in one bag . you have to open every bag and lay the pieces out in order to be able to find everything and even then there 's some question as to whether you 've got the right part turned the right way , per the above comment about the directions . - the whole thing comes tumbling down like a house of cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play . i 've had to put it back together no less than 5 times since i initially put it together this morning . some of the connector pieces do n't fit tightly enough into the sockets on other pieces , so they tend to just slide out instead of locking together firmly . i think that next year , we 'll just stick to legos
0	we bought this game yesterday for our daughter . the dolls are very difficult for her to dress . we have to do it for her . also , two of the dresses have torn already after playing the game only about 4 times . she loves the game and the princesses , and it does teach memory , but it could be made much better .
0	this toy is terrible ! ! my daughter got this for christmas , and it only frustrates her . it takes too many cranks to get the clown to pop up , and she ca n't get the lid to stay shut without my help . the `` music '' is terrible . i would definitely not recommend this toy .
1	comment given by my four year old son bilal , `` i like this game because the buzzing things are so close to each other . this is good because it 's fun . also it'a hard to get the things out and this makes it fun . i play this came with my dad . i got the game because it has shrek on it . i win this game sometimes . the cards have funny things on them and it makes me laugh .
1	this is absolutely adorable . not only is it a great jack in the box for a boy or a girl but you can also play peek a boo with the monkey . my daughter is 20 months old and she loves it ! ! !
1	i love this puzzle ! it is fun and challenging . i believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who wants a challenge . however i find that there is one problem with it . there are no dimensions to tell you how big the puzzle is after you put it togrther ! ! ! i would appreciate it if dimensions were added to the box . i am sure that anyone else who purchases this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this puzzle . if you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle i would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection
1	my son is a college student in boston and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks . `` you 've got to play this game ! '' he said . it had been years since anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a board game was being played . but i wanted to spend time with my son so i consented to learn it . turns out , it was amazing ! my husband , 13-year-old son , the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home . the `` board '' is different every time you play it so nothing is predictable , rolls of the die dictate one 's success , trading and strategies can get intense and the more you play it , the more you definitely like it . alas ! i 've `` settled '' into catan mode and no longer need to beg him to bring it home from school . i bought my own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked on it , too . we play it all the time . cross my heart , this is fun . as my son said , `` you 've got to play this game ! ''
0	i bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday . after playing the game once , she asked me if i could take it back . she said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game . my daughter has always played a lot of `` simulated life '' video games ( i.e. , the sims , animal crossing ) and online games ( i.e , club penguin ) . i suspect this is why she found this game limiting . other games that she has played portray a more intricate `` life '' and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree . my advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this . if your daughter has no experience in these types of games , this game will probably be fine . however if your daughter has previously played simulated life games , she will probably find this one lacking .
1	my son is a huge fan of the thomas friends diecast trains and building sets . despite the fact he had amassed a large portion of these toys , an important character was missing from his collection : terrence the tractor . of course , he was thrilled when this little vehicle showed up in his easter basket . no , terrence is not a train , but one of the tractors that plows the fields on the island of sodor . terrence is a wonderful character , with his bright orange coat of paint and happy face . he has one magnet on his back end , perfect for pulling trains ( or having trains pull him ) . in all honesty , we have not had any problems with terrence 's treads coming off -- they are designed to wrap tightly around the wheels when rolling , so no matter how hard my three-year-old tugs on them , they stay put . terrence is also a very durable toy -- my son has dropped him , stepped on him , ran him into the other trains , and terrence shows no signs of wear , tear , split wood , or chipped paint . finally , terrence is small enough to fit easily in my son 's hands during play , but can also be slipped into a coat pocket during a car trip . all in all , terrence is a terrific vehicle , and a perfect addition to a child 's thomas friends collection
1	my daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves dora . she loves playing with dora and the babies
0	i was very excited about buying this phone for my daughter after seeing it on the internet . that was , until i saw it in the store . there were about 5 in stock and not one of them was in full working condition . most of them had not enough power to play any sounds , while others had parts broken off of it . do n't waste your money on this product . you will surely be disappointed
0	we 've had the same set with christmas colors for three years . after the first year , the `` whistle '' unit ( housed in the tender ) no longer worked . and about 10 minutes into running the second year , the engine stopped . found that the engine was wired so that the power wire was rubbing a drive wheel . the engine is built with an underpowered motor , such that a fairly high power setting is required to get it moving and then it runs fast ; there is only a tiny operating range before it will fly off on a curve . the engine is very top heavy and the curves have a tight radius to them . finally , when taking the entire engine apart this year found the plastic gears flimsy , badly supported and worn even with recommended oiling . i still have some of my fathers lionel trains and these can still be counted on to run today ; the new stuff being sold is meant to be in the trash quickly .
1	the tonka truck was for my grandson for his birthday . his first tonka truck . he loved it . could n't even wait to get it out of the box . he turned one yrs . old and he started trying to sit on the top and he did and it held up . good going tonka
1	we ( my husband and i ) brought this toy for our 2 year old last christmas because then she was an elmo fanatic . she still plays with this toy even though her intrests have shifted to dora ! at first i was n't quite sure what this thing did except make noise but as i watched her play with it , i realized it taught her to follow directios . it 's a mode where elmo asks you to follow the light and the keys light up one by one as you press them and i was truly amazed at my baby actually following the directions . this toy also teaches numbers . overall , this toy is great for toddlers and tends to stay a favorite unlike those toys that end up at the bottom of the toybo
1	my 3 year old loves this toy . he has a lot of the krypto toys and getting mechanikat was essential . we just got it for christmas so am not sure of its longevity . it does seem to be pretty well made . also got snooky wookems with it . great for fans of the krypto cartoons
0	you can get the old vintage aggravation games on ebay for 10 or less and theres also some hand-made wooden boards as well . these new versions dont hold a candle to the old ones , just as old tvs seem better than some of the new ones
0	after receiving , putting together and using this toy with myself and children , i overestimated what it would be . i remember the old school rock 'em sock 'em robots , and this product is n't even close . the old characters stood 6-8 '' tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered . this version has only plastic parts , the characters are 4 '' tall at best , and the 'win ' is from a blow to the chest , not the head . metallo 's head springs up , but superman 's head only nods backward . it is difficult to discern the 'winner ' from the set up . it was only an $ 11 lesson for me to learn , but if you truly want a real rock 'em set , try ebay , or yard sales . this replica is not comparable to the original
0	after reading the other reviews of this product , i felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy . he is learning multiplication tables now , so i figured this was a great present . unfortunately , once the batteries were in , it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to 2 numbers , it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the 2 numbers the dials showed . we tried over and over to get it to work , but it is a dud ! i live overseas so returning it is not an option i am willing to pay the extra freight/duty for . i bought another leap frog product at the same time that i have not given as a present yet , i really hope it works
0	i purchase this by the picture inside it shows little closet type places and a bar for hanging clothes , none if this is there , its cute but i would not recommand this procduct . the picture of the inside is false . it 's not even close .
1	i got this game for my then nearly 4-year-old daughter and a year later she still enjoys playing it . the game is very simple and does not require reading . all the parts and pieces are high quality . it 's a good opportunity to work with numbers and measuring , plus the game goes fast so you can play it quickly if needed or multiple rounds if you have the time/inclination . the object is to create the tallest character by mixing/matching 5 parts ( feet , legs , body , head , and hat ) . the character pieces are brightly colored and fun and include : ballerina , doctor , fireman/woman , policeman/woman , cowboy/cowgirl , and a clown . a roll of the die determines which part you select . the die has both pictures and words -- except for the wild side which is printed in red . after the characters are assembled each player measures with the included ruler ( you can choose centimeters or inches ) to see whose character is the tallest . it 's a sliding ruler with a base so the kids can actually fit their character inside and line up the top with the corresponding number on the ruler . i would n't recommend this game for kids beyond 5 -- it may be a little too simple . but for 3/4/5 's it 's a great game
1	i always thought clue looked like a complicated game i 'd never touch ! that is until i played it at my friends house ! now i 'm a clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions ! this game can never get old because it 's a different outcome every time ! i strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older
1	i bought this set for my grandsons 2nd birthday . my son found it very easy to assemble and my daughter in law loves it because it is a lovely piece of furniture . my grandson loves to sit at the table and look at books or build with blocks . this is a sturdy set that will last for many years
1	this doll rocks ! i love her hair , it 's a dark reddish color and it 's curled into seperate locks . and her dress is gorgeous ! it 's a powder pink color with long sleeves , and at the hands it has a big ball of white feathers . the necklece she has is very pretty , and so is her crown . shes quite durable , and would make a great addition to any collection or toy chest
0	i bought this vehicle for my son ... we have been through 2 already ... they do not work . the controller is not made very well ... the two cars we bought did not respond..the first one you had to put the controller right up to the car to make it work ... the other car would only go forward ... and we tried this with brand new batteries and the charger pack we bought . definitely a disappointment
1	i bought this kitchen for my 18 mos . old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it . it is a nice , compact size that does n't take up too much space . she can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated . another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box . my only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open , but i know as she gets older , it will become easier . i would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child
0	my one year old and i love these blocks . they are light , soft and provide endless opportunity for imagination . however , they are extremely expensive and of inferior quality construction . when we opened the box , we found that several of the blocks were not cut along a straight edge making them difficult to stack . also , several of the identical shape blocks were not exactly the same size leading to stacking problems . one of the blocks was peeling in one corner . these blocks are such a great idea i find it hard to believe no other companies are making them
1	i purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present . i was skeptical , but since it was the only thing requested , i bought it . we 've had it 4 weeks . what a great pool toy ! kids love it ! we have a 22 foot above ground pool , and it works fine . i have bought floats for upwards of $ 25 dollars , so for the cost of the wave cruiser you ca n't go wrong . it seems to be well built and sturdy . i would n't hesitate to get on it . takes 8 `` d '' batteries that are in a water tight case . it will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy , but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids . overall great gift idea
1	this game is a great way to pass twenty to thirty minutes . it is very easy to learn and does not have any pieces to lose , or money to count . the strategies , however , are numerous , and there is an equal amount of luck as skill involved in good gameplay . i really liked how the game could only be played with two people , as i was tired of games that could be played with two , but which were really meant to be enjoyed by three or more ... game contents : 1 deck of game cards , and one small board . note : if you want to make this game really portable you do n't even need to bring the board . it is just a place to put discarded cards and a way to help organize your cards . as long as you have a pencil and paper for scoring at the end of the game , you can play it everywhere that you have a table . ( i figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as the size of a typical monopoly board ) . playing note : one thing that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading the instructions , was that the instructions do not explain that you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as your opponent . you can each play all 5 expeditions , in a head to head manner . we were sitting on a couch at a coffee table , and we had turned the board horizontally to face us ( instead of vertically ) and the instructions were confusing until we moved the board 90 degrees . the game designers assumed that you would play the game as one would play a game of checkers , sitting across from one another , but you do n't actually have to play this way , even though you do need to turn your board for the same effect . this game is really fun and i would highly recommend other games from the same manufacturer ( rio grande games ) . they really have a knack for publishing great strategy games . they even release expansion sets to their popular games , and they credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion cards . pretty neat
0	painting the plates is a fun activity because you can be creative . the only problem is that you have to be careful or they could crack or break
0	this item had a description for ages three and up . this is n't even close . now i 'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five-year-old who is so attached to the fact it 's a batmobile he can get in , even if his knees practically knock at his chin , that i 'll never pry it from him . he 's only going to be able to even get in it for probably two more months . it was a complete waste of money . it 's suited for two to three-year-olds and small four-year-olds
0	after waiting 3-4 weeks , it finally arrived ! to my grandchildrens dismay . it did not perform as advertised . there was n't any volcano erupting , all it did was sprinkle a small amount from the side . yes we did have good water pressure , and it was put together correctly ! i just want my money and shipping charges back ! thank you for your expediency on this return
0	my boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea , being into the pirate theme . thankfully i purchased this sandbox in-store , because i returned it the very same day . i did n't even fill it with sand before i realized it was a cheaply made toy . the plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places . the lid would n't fit on correctly , even if it was n't bent at some of the edges it would n't have been a good , secure fit . i was surprised that little tikes would make something so flimsy . i exchanged it for the step 2 naturally playful sandbox , which is sturdier and the lid works much better . spend the extra $ 10 for a sandbox that is higher quality .
0	this toy was so frustrating , the pieces would n't snap together properly and it was messy and my son ended up walking away from it he was so fed up . this was after a half an hour of me attempting to make the pieces fit together properly . in the end , it looked like a pile of cloudy lime jello with plastic bones sticking out of it . i would not reccomend this toy
0	this is a very cheaply made product that does not stand up to any child play . my sons got this recently and within 24 hours one of the sticks had broken . the company was nice enough to send a new one out but now ( only a few weeks later ) the plastic on the goal is shattered . the goal also does not stay together very well and comes apart with each goal scored . overall , i would highly discourage you from wasting quite a bit of money for plastic that will not hold up to child play ! !
1	my daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it . this pool is big enough that i can just get in with her and we have a blast . because of her age i do n't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine . ( it just looks a little funny ) i found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away . i was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments i had it put away and every time i use it i find it easier and easier . this pool is great for traveling to grandma 's house too ! i would recommend this to anyone young and old
1	the developers of this game did a great job coming up with questions designed to appeal to kids , questions like : if you could star in a movie , which movie would you choose ? if you could eat only one food for the rest of your life what would it be ? the questions range from simple to a bit more complex , so that kids who like challenges as well as those who do n't will enjoy the game . another thing : although you can follow the rules and play this strictly as a board game , we used it while we were just sitting around the table having a casual chat . sometimes the kids asked the question , sometimes the adults did ... but we all learned more about one another ... a lot more ... and many of the questions got us talking about family history , memories , etc . lots of fun ! it 'd be great to take the questions along on a trip or while eating at a restaurant since they are surefire conversation starters but not so personal that anyone 's `` personal boundaries '' will be invaded . plus , there are no right or wrong answers and any information provided is strictly voluntary , revealing as much or as little as the respondent wants . one caveat : you will eventually go through all the questions so this game wo n't last forever ... unless you are able to find new people to participate . if so , it be used for years . in terms of fostering family closeness without any threatening or off-limits questions ( in short , everyone has to play nicely together ) this is great !
1	well , i just think that the little beauty on the cover easily sells this product . can you even imagine her tooting ? she 's too cute ! the slick gentleman blowing on the whistle like it 's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both ends . this thing is going to sound like a true to life fart ... but without all the hassle of the smell . one warning ... do not use this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device . please use a real loud whistle . you would n't want to be alone in an empty parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to your aid . if i heard farts in an empty parking garage i would most likely run the other way . this whistle is for good times only .
0	i absolutely love this deck . i bought this along with `` zombie madness '' and the `` warrior 's triumph '' structure decks . they all rock , but this is my favorite . and for the guy who gave the winged dragon of ra tip , on the bottom of the card it says `` this card can not be used in a duel '' . so even if you happen to get one [ which costs a lot ] you ca n't officially use it . overall , this deck is very cool . i love red eyes darkness dragon ! p.s . for best results , buy the yu-gi-oh ! deluxe pack for 20 $ . it comes with `` dragon 's roar '' and `` zombie madness '' plus two rare cards [ `` rope of life '' and `` armed dragon lv7 '' ] . here 's what they do : rope of life pgd-105-ultra rare trap card : this card can only be activated by discarding your entire hand when 1 of your own monsters is sent to the graveyard as a result of battle . special summon the monster just sent to the graveyard in face-up attack or defense position , and increase its atk by 800 points . `` armed dragon lv7 '' this card can not be normal summoned or set . this card can not be special summoned except by the effect of `` armed dragon lv5 '' . send 1 monster card from your hand to the graveyard to destroy all face-up monsters on your opponent 's side of the field with an atk equal to or less than the atk of the sent monster . add this the deck for an amazing combo ! start off by setting a masked dragon card in defense mode . when your opponent destroys it , use its effect to summon `` armed dragon lv3 '' . during your standby phase , send it to the graveyard to special summon `` armed dragon lv5 '' . then use it to attack your opponent 's monster which is most likely destroyed . then when you end your turn use its effect to special summon `` armed dragon lv7 '' from your hand or deck ! you now have a 2800 atk points on the field ! sweet ! and its effect is soooooooooo cool . i put the `` rope of life '' card in my `` warrior 's triumph '' structure deck . it helps out a lot ! i hope you will make the right choice in buting this deck or the more preferable deluxe pack . yu-gi-oh ! your move
1	i bought my harvey toy a while ago , and i was quite pleased . it 's actually very durable , like everyone else has said . the crane does n't break off , no matter how often you play with it or how hard you may accidentaly step on it . i think the only way to break it off is via steam roller . anyway , highly recommended for any thomas collector
1	a lot of people look at this figure and say 'he has no wings ! '.while this is true , i still recommend this toy , an excellant hair sculpt and goku 's famous 'i have no idea what 's going on , but be happy anyway ! 'look.the wings are actually really cool , although the halo has a job staying on.0verall this is a great toy and a definate purchase for any dbz fan or toy collector
0	i bought this oven for my children . after i lugged it home , my wife , an aspiring novelist , told me that `` it was a quear , sultry summer , the summer they electrocuted the rosenbergs , and i did n't know what i was doing in new york . '' i said `` do n't you like the kid 's new stove ? '' she replied , `` how frail the human heart must be - a mirrored pool of thought. `` i left it at that , and cooked some macaroni and cheese for dinner , after a good cigar and a glass of weller 's , i came back into the kitchen , only to discover ... .well , that 's a long story , i just hope you realize this ai n't no kids stove , it 's the real deal , bud . chance rules every corner of the universe except the chambers of the human heart
0	i recently purchased this computer for my twin granddaughters who are four . i have returned them because the screen is too small . additionally , i thought it would have a word processor ; it does not . it is game oriented
1	i bought two of these trucks for my twin boys when they were 16 months old . they loved it so much and the bubbles come out the front for added fun . the music and lots of buttons to push , a storage under the seat and a fire helmet makes this a fabulous toy . my boys are now 27 months and have not stopped playing with this truck ! ! its great , buy it , buy it !
0	i was really excited about this toy because it was a stacking and sorting toy in one . and i love laugh and learn toys . i got it for my daughter for christmas when she was 16 months old . she never liked it . i kept it out and encouraged her to play with it , but she just really did n't get into it . also , there is a sticker that goes on the bottom of the top pot so you can see the shapes through the holes on the lid , and the sticker shapes do n't match the holes ! unfortunately , this toy was a big let down .
1	our daughter got the pull and spin caterpillar for christmas ( she was 9months at the time ) . at the time she was n't able to pull it but loved to chase the caterpillar as it was being pulled . now at 12 months she is able to pull it herself and loves putting just about anything on the back of the caterpillar . the toy it self has a very cute face and when pulled the eyes and ears move up and down . the only problem with the caterpillar is the pull string . it is very small and thin allowing it to slip through little hands while trying to pull it . overall a wonderful toy , not only for the balls that come with it but for anything else that your little puts on it
1	this was a hit for both of our kids . they had so much fun making their very own unique soccer ball . we have already used it for our indoor soccer league and it was a hit ! ! for all you soccer moms and dads , this is a wonderful gift for your child .
0	this product is a waste of money after the lightbulb goes out and the lighbulb did n't last very long in the first place . polyconcept does not make the lightbulbs available in the stores . after numerous phone calls to polyconcept ( manufacturer ) i have yet to receive replacement light bulbs ! ! ! so basically , it is now useless .
0	this was a fun and very portable toy for my 18-month-old son . unfortunately , the elephant noise quit working after about 6 weeks of play , and then the monkey noise stopped working about 2 weeks later . also , the train easily comes off the track , but my son loves playing with the train that way , too . he 's very disappointed that the animals are now quiet
0	as star wars kits go , it 's better than most . ertl should have spent more time on the molds and getting the details right . the kit , while having very few parts , is not a novice kit . it has fit issues and badly ﻿mis-aligned parts . the upper and lower fuselages do not mate well and the solar panels do not align well with the hull . the solar panels tend to cant to the rear , not setting in line with the fuse . it 's a case of both of the parts , the solar panels and the fuselage being out of alinement . much work is needed to get the solar panels to aline with the hull and the mounting pylons . one bright spot is the well defined , engraved panel lines and the small details . the upper hatch and cockpit glass is the clearest of the star wars kits i have built . it 's better than the x-wing and other fighters and is as good in the detail department as the at-at . having not built the rare tie fighter kit , i can not say how it rate against it . once the fit problems are dealt with , and a good paint job is applied , it makes a good display , but it requires some modeling experience to get it to look as it should . the stand is not sturdy enough for the weight of the model . i suggest a clear plastic rod and a wooden base
0	this product reminds me of thick slightly mushy sand that you would play with at the beach except it comes in colors . playdough is much easier to work with if you want to build items/objects/shapes . my daughter will play with playdough for hours but with this product , she lost interest after 10 minutes
1	my granddaughter requested this for christmas , and i had a hard time finding it until i checked the amazon site..it 's just what she wante
1	my 2 year old grandson loves balls of any kind , when i found this activity set i knew he would really enjoy it , he plays with it for hours . the only downside of this is that he can not keep up with the balls . it would be great if this company would give parents , or grandparents an order form to get replacement balls to give this fun toy longer life
0	our grandson is barely four years and of average size for his age , yet the batmobile is much too small for him . for a kid who loves batman , it is intriguing and he did try to use it as he pretended to be the batman of his imagination . but after just 2 or 3 days , he gave up and returned to his tricycle . as a result , except for the initial 2 or 3 days of limited pleasure he got out of it , the batmobile has been a waste of money . on the other hand , for a child of 3 , it should be fun , i think , for at least awhile
0	when my grandson first received the game he loved it ! then he and his family had to re-locate which meant taking down the game . when they got to their new home , the game does n't stay up like it did
1	x4 metal detector rover national geographic uncle milton ; 6 and up ; the yellow-and-black vehicle and its 5-foot remote cable crawls over sand , dirt or grass . lights and sounds alert the user when treasures ( coins , old spoons , jewelry , etc . ) are found . it teaches kids about magnetic fields and also can be used as an ordinary play vehicle .
0	this one does n't work . it is supposed to come on when it hits the water and it does n't . one it came on randomly but we could n't seem to replicate it . none of this type of fish seem to do all that well but this one is worse than the others . he is pretty though
0	i think this doll is incredibly fun and beautiful , but somehow the tail broke off the very first day my 4 year old daughter played with it . she loves it anyway , she insists . she just screamed with pleasure after seeing the hair turn purple and the tattoos appear after about 3 minutes in the freezer . i do n't know how it got broken , or how rough my daughter might have been , but it seems strange that it would break so quickly . disappointing
0	my daughter got this doodle bear for christmas 2006 . she wrote all over it and i washed it like the directions say . i took it out of the washing machine and the bear was ripped . she played with it again and i washed it again in the pillow case . the bear came out of the washing machine worse off . it seems that the bear rips at the seams . do n't waste your money on this bear .
0	the `` microscope '' never worked at all . it is cheap plastic and very badly made . you get a few small pieces of indicator paper and a few bags of baking soda , citric acid and gelatin plus one prepared slide you will not be able to view with the `` microsope '' . very disappointing . the discovery channel kits are better value . do n't waste your money on this kit
0	who would sell an r/c toy car that runs backwards continuously ? it was a big disappointment for my granddaughter . tyco 's lighting mcqueen was greeted with glee when it was unwrapped , and found its way to the trash with the day 's wrapping paper . pos
1	i brought this toy to aid my two-year old in learning how dress
0	i purchased this for about $ 20.00 . and i followed the directions carefully . despite that , a coin slipped into the mechanism . there was no way to remove it , even though i tried that as carefully as possible . i threw the device in the trash . i did keep the plastic tubes that the holds the coins , and i now separate coins by hand . the advantage of the tubes is that they hold exactly the right number of coins , so you avoid counting them
1	we have had this sandbox for five years . it has been durable and my two kids ages 3 and 5 just love it . color of the plastic is still bright and has been under sun for years . sometimes water seeps in when it rains but this makes sand play even funner for kids . we tend to put a rock on top of lid to keep it in place though it does cover the box perfectly . it is also nice that the lid is attached to the box itself and is easy for kids to remove and put back on when done . the kids usually sit outside of it though it can accomodate 1-2 small kids inside it as well . i find most kids dont want to get sand all over and end up sitting outside of it regardless . overall good investment and the kids love it
0	dont waste your money . i bought a set for each of my kids , and they did n't work well . the paper that came with the pens , was thin and cheap . we followed the directions , and twisted , and it either did n't work , or blended for a split second , and then back to original color . total waste of money . they are now in the trash
0	i got the baby alive hispanic doll for my daughter for christmas . i opted for the hispanic doll becuase i thought my daughter would learn a bit of the two languages as we speak french primarily in our home.i must have received a broken doll because our doll is nothing like the description . she does not speak english at all ... you can press her bracelet a million times and no english . and when she does speak , her english is slurred and unintelligible . we have contacted amazon several times and have had them decline a return . after 2 months , we are still wiating for her to eat and fall asleep . very disappointing ! would not recommend at all ! ! ! the reason that this rating received one star is because my daughter loves her death even though she does nothing
0	buyer beware ! ! ! ! i recently ordered ( december 15th , 2007 ) this product through amazon filled by joe brands for my son for christmas . on amazon 's website it says you can cancel an order any time before it ships , if it does ship , you simply refuse receipt . i canceled this order on december 16th less than 24 hours after i placed it , i called and emailed joe brands emailed amazon . never the less the package arrives on december 22nd . i called the shipping company , called and emailed joe brands , emailed amazon and the package was finally picked up on the 27th of december . the billing however has yet to be straighted out . my credit card has yet to be credited , i do not have the product , and no one returns calls or emails . buyer beware ! ! !
0	i ordered this for my son 's up coming 1st birthday party . i figured he and his little friends can sit in there to play . i received the package this morning and i was in for a surprise . first of all , 50 % of the balls ( it came with 100 balls ) were half inflated . the shell of the balls are so soft , and somehow the air inside was not full enough ; thus half of the ball looked crushed . then , i thought , `` fine , i just go buy another 100 balls to mix them in . no biggie '' . then , i inflated the pit for my son to play in . no more than an hour later , the main part of the pit deflated by almost half and the plug was still securely attached . so , there must a hole somewhere . this toy is totally unsalvageable . i had to make a call to amazon and they have authorized the return of this product for a refund . this is a very low quality product . i did n't expect kiddie toy like this will last long , but one hour is too short for me . i do n't think i will buy anything from this ball toyz company in the future either . i think their balls are too flimsy .
1	i bought this game for my 7 year old last winter - because he loved the book so much . he quickly mastered the game , which requires you to earn state cards by recognizing certain items about each state , such as the color of the card , whether the capital starts with a certain letter or if the state nickname has a person 's name embedded in it . all his friends liked the game when they came over , so i ended up buying and giving at least 6 more as birthday presents for his friends and for a niece and nephew . but , more than that , this game has spawned a further interest in geography in my son . he began playing with a wooden puzzle of the usa as a result of the information on the game cards . in doing so , he taught himself most of the capitals ( which are also on the game cards ) and the shapes of the various states . he continues to want to learn more about us geography . i highly recommend the book and game for ages 5 and up .
0	the toy is a lure to a social networking website for little kids . they play games against `` friends '' , who are strangers on the web . they `` chat '' , but only with preapproved messages . there is always a reason to come back to the website tomorrow and play some more . i do n't think teaching little kids to keep coming back to a website is particularly healthy . i really do n't think teaching them to interact with strangers on the internet is a good lesson , no matter how sanitized the interactions might be on the webkinz site .
0	i bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother , who is impossible to please . she needed a new card shuffler , as she was n't pleased with her plastic , battery operated one . i must admit , i thoroughly expected to have to return it , since i knew she would n't be pleased with it . as it turns out , i did have to return it , but here 's the surprise . i was very disappointed in its performance too ! we could not get it to shuffle cards , whether they be from a new deck , or an old , worn out , dog eared deck . moral of this story -- please do n't buy this item , whether you 're difficult to please or not
0	if rating a `` no star '' was possible , that 's what it really deserves . i bought this for my two year old twin boys and as i was inflating it - with a handpump - it blew at the seams ! beyond patching ! unfortunately they never even knew that they had it . i would not buy it again because of the quality of the product . how can kids be safe jumping on something that blows out when being pumped by a hand pump ? ? ? that 's like blowing it up by mouth !
0	it never worked - period . not even for a second . get the disney fish - it does n't look as real but at least it works .
0	just like a big chunk of us right now , i 'm quite the sudoku addict . i just ca n't put those little puzzles down ! so , i have to tell you first , if you have n't worked sudoku puzzles yet , you are really missing out ! get your hands on some ! naturally , i was excited to try out a sudoku game and race against my friends to solve the puzzles . but what a disappointment ! one small board , several people straining to see it , everyone racing to fill in the puzzle ... it just does n't work . the way they designed this game was to have a board , which is the puzzle to be solved , and number tiles that you distribute evenly amongst the players . everyone rushes to fill in the puzzle , and the person who uses all their number tiles first is the winner , assuming the puzzle is solved correctly . first of all , if you have more than 2 people playing , the players are n't all going to be able to see the board well . some people are going to have the board upside-down trying to solve it . that 's rough ! talk about getting confused between 6s and 9s ! plus , everyone 's hands are in the way while they 're laying their tiles , which makes it really hard to see and concentrate on the puzzle . next , inevitably in the games i 've played someone lays a tile wrong . then the whole game is thrown off . the instructions say that if someone rids themselves of their tiles but placed them incorrectly , then the next person to finish would win provided all their tiles are correct . most likely , if one person has made an error , that will have caused a chain reaction and the next person 's tiles will also be placed wrong , and not necessarily by fault of either of the players . it could have been anyone who started the chain reaction . the format just does n't work for this game . my advice is to pass on this particular game . perhaps a game where people were racing side-by-side on the same puzzle , but with their own puzzle , would work better
0	i am so glad we tested this product ahead of time . as a rule we test all battery opperated gifts before we wrap them , these walkie-talkies worked for ab out 10 'feet ' ... yes i said feet . we gave them to my 2 year old grandson to play with instead of his big brother who got a set of midlands . do n't waste your money on these..
1	this product is fun for the whole family . i hope my kids have as much fun as i did with them when i was young
1	this barbie is better than some of the other new ones but i did`nt see the street style one yet.but i don`t know if they are that good by the reviews i am hearing so far.i like her outfit , typical , shop-o-holic and typical school girls is quite nice and fits her personality.she has a locker with basic stuff you take to school with a secret inside.her out fit is denim capri`s , black jacket , matching beret , and a tube top with a necklace
0	i had water rockets like this when i was a kid in the early 1970s . the rockets were no different from the ones that come in this package . they shoot high and straight and are loads of fun . my only gripe is with the pump . when i was a kid , the pump was heavy plastic and metal . the pump on these new rockets is cheap plastic . the knob on the end broke off the first or second day . my son and i are still able to shoot the rockets , but we have to carefully stick the knob back on each time we want to pump up a rocket .
0	these trains are very neat and my sons loved them when we first got them . they each have been through two sets with the same result ... the water leaks out after you 've had them awhile . they are not worth the money . i highly recommend investing in another train instead of the aquarium cars . this was the first time my guys have been disappointed with a thomas product .
1	satisfied with the overall quality of the product . also with the purchase process
1	finally - a way to buy just the lego bricks to build using your imagination . i only have one , but no more `` kits '' for me ! ! even the lego company on line does n't have this one ! highly recommended
0	i was very excited about this game until it came out of the box . it looks great for my 3 year-old but as in other reviews the spinner ruins the entire game . this should have been obvious at design and this game should never have made it to stores with this defect . it is particularly frustrating because the concept seems so good with a lot of thought put into the educational value . i think ill will is going to be the result of this penny minding in construction . leapfrog could have further enhanced the brand with this product but fumbled
1	this was strickly a replacement for an old solver that i have had . would not want to be without one as i am an avid crossword puzzle solver . many thanks for the prompt service i was given by amazon
1	this is a great way to get your child ( ren ) to do the things that need to be done around the house . i purchased two , one for each of my older children and they love that they have control over keeping up with the board . it is easy for them to use and easy for you to keep track of their progress .
1	i bought these stilts for my 10 year old daughter . my other children who are 8 and 9 love them and so do all of their friends . they are affordable and sturdy ! ! i recommend them ! ! !
0	i bought this with high hopes of getting a well modeled vehicle . it took about only ten minutes to put together , and it comes with general greivous ! ! ! but , the legs are really weird . i wasted $ 20.00 dollars at a local super target i could have got a star wars video game or a few figs ... .. i just like adding it to my collection . but , if you have the obi-wan with boga , put them together like i did . the star wars saga has introduced some really good toys , i am just saying that this toy is fairly good . not a favorite . i suggest it to a collecter only ... ... .. i love the line of e3 collectables . they really rock . i suggest this because it is okay in the stage of durable and fun . star wars e3 general greivous ' wheel bike is a great toy i hope people should think about buying
0	the horse does n't stay hooked on to the carriage too well . it always comes apart . it 's a pain . it 's also tricky to get the horse to stay standing . it 's cute to look at , but my daughter lost interest in it quickly
0	my daughter who is about to turn 4 loves this game . she wants to play it constantly . so it 's good for their entertainment value but bad for yours . the dresses are hard to get on the dolls and they rip and tear very easily . it takes as long to set the game up as it does to take it . there are also some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having to go as far as the die say but you ca n't go over that numbers i.e . you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that 's allowed . that 's confusing when you 're trying to teach your kids their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you 'd be rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you 're trying to reach
1	this is a great game ! using clues to get others to say the secret word . another great classic game brought back by endless ! a++
1	as usual , this is another quality product from power wheels . the fit and finish is perfect and the overall quality is excellent . the only upgrade i can advise is to buy the power wheels 12v quick charger for the battery
0	this game was not engaging . my son did not find it interesting . he has not asked to play with it again . you push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself . if you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance , try what 's gnu . it is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults .
0	you could make your own ! i bought these through a catalog for my 3 year-old last christmas . he pretends they are leaf-blowers . if you find the `` sweet spot '' , the tones are okay , but finding that spot is n't easy . too much money for not-enough product
1	my son received this when he was 15 months old and has never stopped playing with it regularly . he loves putting things in the back and zooming around the living room . great buy
0	this was a total change from the boardgame . it is a lot of fun , however i have changed the winning amount , otherwise someone can win the whole game with just one hand
0	this product kept my 5-and-3-year-olds ' attention for ten minutes , tops . it does not look like the pictures in the ads . it usually got stuck in the molds instead of sliding out effortlessly as it would appear in the ad . it makes a mess , gets all over the place and truly does not seem to be much fun . it got put away in the cabinet and my childen never asked for it again . my money is better spent on modeling clay or other arts crafts types of activities
1	my 5 year old twins really like this game ... it is sometimes difficult to balance the toppings , but that is why they like it so much . on the other hand , my 3 year old finds it very frustrating . if you are considering purchasing this for a younger child you can rough up the pizza part with a piece of sand paper to help with the slippage .
1	i love this chimp and i am an adult . all the kids in the neighborhood come to play with it . it is so realistic
0	my wife and i were not impressed with the caterpillar tunnel . the material was flimsy and light weight . the tunnel is small and our children ( even our 1-year-old ) could n't crawl through it without making the toy twist and roll over . since it was not what we expected , we decided to return it and get our money back
0	my 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times . our version did not include the `` 5 ways to play '' as stated on the box . ( i 've requested a copy from briarpatch . ) my 4 year old - who received the gift - lost interest after the first time he played . both of my boys love the `` i spy '' and `` can you see what i see '' books . this game just was n't challenging enough for them
1	an unexciting piece . of value only to the completist collector ( like myself ) . there 's nothing wrong with it , it 's just that there 's nothing `` great '' about it either . the lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a `` holographic '' figure . hasbro could has done better by choosing another `` host '' sculpt to base this exclusive off of . the `` phantom menace '' version was much better
0	this pack is really bad ! i love attacktix , but this pack is terible ! the only good figues are luke skywalker , and megatron . darth vader 's arm broke , super optimus prime 's blast shoots before you press the button , and the battle masters are pathetic . the battle master 's point value is 70 each , but they are very easy to kill , and their blasts are very bad . do yourself a faver , skip this and buy the star wars attacktix series 4 starter set
1	i got this for my 15 month son . he really loves it ! he does n't use it as a ride-on yet ( more fun will await ! ) , but he pushes the car from the back handle everywhere inside out . there are alot of buttons which make sounds and some have the car talk back . the `` oil change '' sounds are his fav . he also enjoys the toy phone ( when you put it in the slot it rings and the car answers ! ) there is also a small storage section under the seat.. the only thing i wish it did have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car 's sayings . for the price it is a great interactive toy ! ! and for a boy who usually is not big on his toys for very long , this still captures his attention months afterward ! .oh , and this toy can take a beating ! no complaints whatsoever ! a great find
1	i bought this for my 5 year old grandson , he is very active and i thought it would be a good way to burn up some of that extra energy ! not only does he love it , but so does his 2 year old sister . my daughter tells me that they both dance and dance , until they fall down laughing . this was certainly a good buy
1	my 8yo dd received this for her bday . she loves it . it has lots of storage space insde for all her polly pocket goodies . it 's also quite sturdy . one of the levels got bent the wrong way and i was able to put it back and it still works
1	i purchased this item when my daughter was one year old , and it was amazing ! my daughter was always a good sleeper , but when she began teething at around 9-10 months old , she began refusing to stay in her crib each night . i was out of ideas , and my husband and i had tried just about every method we read about without success . finally , i found the tomy star bright light , and it was like a miracle worker ! the first night i used it , my daughter put herself to sleep in her crib by staring at the ceiling . each night , her sleeping became better and better . now , we only run it once for 10 minutes and she falls asleep . it is a much better approach then allowing your child to `` cry it out '' . she actually enjoys going to sleep now and looks forward to watching the light show before she falls asleep .
0	i consider myself to be a fairly intelligent individual , and growing up in a family where a saturday was spent working on the classic car in the garage , or watching football on sunday , as a female , i know a lot of male stuff . even i could n't answer hardly any of the `` male '' questions , since in this game , men answer questions about womanly stuff , and women answer questions about manly stuff . we have played it twice now , and even though the men 's team has always had 1 male more in touch with his female side than most , the women have always gotten our butts kicked . it is so one sided it 's not even funny . even the men were saying , it 's not even fun since the game lasts basically 10 minutes . one of the men said he even had to think twice about some of the `` male '' questions . if i were anyone looking to get a good party game , i certainly would n't put my money out to get this again .
1	my 2yr old got this one and another imaginext dinosaur for christmas and this one is by far his favorite . he loves attaching the cart to the mammoth and moving them around . the reason why i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy . when you think it 's pushed down all the way , you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise . also , like the last reviewer i think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean . but overall the toy is fun and very durable
0	the stable falls apart and pieces are tiny . big waste of money - very frustrating . i 'm considering supergluing it together - this should n't have been a problem
0	rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales . he is shamed into giving them to everyone . sounds like a communist primer
1	my 4 year old son got some early christmas money from his grandparents . so we went and bought this toy at target ( and paid 30.09 for it ) he loves it ... his favorite part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it together different each time . my only concern was that the snow monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries ? ? ? what are those ? ?
0	this thing only lasted 3 days ! i mean really.i charged it up and it worked fine.but it only lasted about 5 minutes then i had to charge it again.when i looked under it i noticed that stiafom was breaking off ! on the 3rd day i charged it up and it never worked again ! ! ! ! ! ! so i went back to toysrus and renturnd the piece of crud.do never buy this toy ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	i just bought this yesterday and surprised my girls ( 3 and 5 ) with it today . it does blow tons of bubbles ! they love chasing them all over the yard . the gazillion bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles are really colorful when they come out . it does used 8 aa batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from inside to send away for an adaptor . yes , it has a plug for an adaptor to plug it in so you do n't use so many batteries . where i 'll plug it in in the backyard i 'm not sure yet . i definitely recommend for the young children that are so excited by bubbles
0	this thing just does n't work , do n't bother . it wo n't stay upright no matter what you do , so there 's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it . looks like it would be fun if it worked . the most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason .
1	my 3 year old is very interested in space and loves this toy . having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it -- -- the payload doors do n't really close , the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on . meets the need for a realistic shuttle , though
1	santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for christmas and she loves it . she takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt . one of the things i love about it is it is n't too heavy for her to carry . she can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble . it is also very sturdy . she has even sat in it herself and it did n't break . i would recommend this doll carrier . it is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy
1	we bought my son a couple of starfighters , the tri-fighter , the at-rt , and the wheel bike . he loves the starfighters and likes the at-rt a little . he rarely plays with the wheel bike . i think the starfighters are just simpler , sturdier , and easier to play with . the wheel bike ( and to a smaller extent the at-rt ) are more complicated , and thus less fun for a 5-year old . we run around having mock dog-fights with the starfighters , but poor old general grievous sits in the toy box . overall , probably good for older kids who can more expertly manipulate the legs and other stuff , but not all that fun for the younger guys
1	easy , straightforward interface ( for instance , a button for each number ) and navigation through cells . easy to tell which numbers start with the puzzle and which ones you entered . provides time-penalized hints in any cell . pauseable and saves your game between ( auto-off ) power sessions . most importantly , this device lets you make `` pencil marks '' ! i have checked out at least a dozen products and i have yet to come across an electronic sudoku that electronically lets me enter dots or xs to indicate which numbers might ( not ) be in a cell . it makes me wonder if the people ordered to design and implement these games actually play sudoku themselves . the closest i 've seen let you enter multiple numbers in a cell and it blinks through them , which i find cumbersome and patience-trying . sadly , this thing does n't do electronic marks either , but their lower-cost solution involves a dry-erase pen that lets you make the marks right on the screen , on top of little numbers printed in each cell 's background . losing marks in travel is prevented by the recessed contours of the screen . why not 5 stars ? just the fact that the marks are n't electronic , there 's no backlight , and the shadows cast by the dry-erase marks can be a little disorienting . otherwise , a well-done , fun , and addictive product
1	i bought this game two weekends ago and have had both fun and frustration with it . i 'm a freecell junkie and have gone so far as to download a better version ( more games ) than the one that came with my computer . i lost track of how many total games i 've played over the years since i 've used several computers , but i play about 10 games a day on average . i 'm very competitive and love keeping track of my stats . unfortunately , that is the weakness of this version of the game . for example , if you get into a position were you can move only one card back and forth between two columns and there are no other moves , all you can do is hit the replay button or move on to another game . if you hit the replay button you do n't get a loss recorded , which of course you should . consequently , it is easy to run up a high win percentage with this version of the game just by resigning a game when you think you are going to loose and replay it . then when you finally win , you get credit for a win . of course , that is not proper scoring either . also , there is a key combination that when you do lose a game outright and want to replay , you do n't get any further losses counted against you . that 's as it should be . the only problem is that key combination is very flaky and does n't always work . other than scoring inconsistencies , it 's a great game ! it 's very easy to use . although different to use than playing with a mouse on your computer , if you 've played a lot on your computer you 'll pick up the operation of this version almost immediately . the display is large and easy to see , and there is a low light level sensor on the front that will automatically light the screen when you are playing in an area with poor lighting . that is a great feature . i love playing this game while sitting in the airport waiting to board a plane and on the plane itself while in the air . it 's a great and challenging way to pass the time away if you like playing solitaire . on the next version of this game , i hope they will beef up the statistics capabilities of the unit
1	as with all the leap frog products , this ones a lot of fun . packed full of learning surprises . i have always felt that making learning fun and easy cuts down on the fact that it 's 'work ' . the birthday surprise is fun and full of rhyming words , that make little one want to learn . i have a hard time giving any leapfrog products anything but a 5 star rating , because of the quality in all their products . learning last a lifetime , so get them started with fun friends from leap frog .
0	i purchased this toy based on the excellent reviews it had here at amazon , it looked also like a fun toy with educational value . i am very disappointed . for starters , my son finds it very frustrating that the front pieces for eyes , face hat can only go on in one order . he also has trouble pulling the pieces apart once they are together , and he is very dextrous for his age . also disappointing is the lack of container to store all the pieces in . without this , the blocks are loose in my son 's toybox and we can never find all the pieces . the packaging could easily be redesigned to hold the pieces . all in all , it is not a toy he can sit and play with without assistance , as i had thought it might be . when he does play with it he enjoys it for about 15 minutes and moves on to something else . we could have done without this toy under our christmas tree
1	i love the luke fx lightsaber more than any other one because it is made nicely , it is light , and it has a good glow in the dark that makes it look real . i would not even dream of fighting with it , i would think it would break in a few days of fighting . there is not much to say except it is the best fx next to the darth vader and it looks cool in the dark . it is so bright it lights up a whole room when the lights are off
0	purchased this for a 3 1/2 year old boy . was hesitant about buying any large , plastic truck , but we did not see any alternatives at the time we purchased this . we should have stuck with our instinct . when it arrived , we were immediately struck by the fact that the plastic seemed flimsy , and that many small plastic pieces that are attached to the grader appeared and felt so cheap and flimsy that we doubted they would survive 5 minutes of play , in our humble opinion . we were not going to wait to find out , and we decided to send this back . you can get a steel tonka 18 '' grader off of ebay for less than what amazon is asking for this plastic thing . that 's exactly what we did . good luck
0	i bouht this object and i think i would of rather bought a doll or something . i brought it home and it didnt work at all so we returned it and the next one was worse ! ! we folloed all the instructions and the sugar that we poured in didnt stick to the stick . even worse , the store wont let us return it because they say thats how they all work .
0	after returning three defective tonka hands on power shovels , ( aka crane , ) we decided to try a different piece of machinery and brought home the dump truck . so far the dump truck is doing fine . it is not as exciting as the crane or digger , but it does work and seems to be holding up . my son loves to turn it on & amp ; have it `` follow '' him around the room . however the motor strains , and the truck moves very slowly , so i 'm concerned that the load is too much for the motor . he likes the loading action of the front end shovel into the dump bed , and the dumping bed . he was disappointed that it does n't steer like the crane did , but only goes either forward or reverse . but a working toy is better than an non-working toy , and i 'm hopeful this one will be a keeper
1	i 've been consistently impressed by the bionicle toys from lego , and the rahkshi are no exception . wish i was young enough to actually play with this stuff . sigh . anyway , rahkshi take the bionicle can-sold figures to new a new level of articulation . in total , joints are found at the neck , shoulder , wrist , hip , knee , and ankle , and the crank on the back swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can whack things with the staff-like weapon each of the rahkshi weilds . then there 's the opening case on the back so you can flip spooky little rubber leech/slug things through the air . each one of these things appears to come with a miniature cd full of quicktime promotional stuff for the toys , game , web site , etc . the voice is a bit melodramatic , but it 's still kind of neat . i like the 360-degree rotating model of the toy you just bought ... sort of redundant , since you can look at the one in real life , but nifty all the same . one thing that mildly disappointed me is that the rahkshi 's weapon is n't really an independanly existing object - which is to say that the bar held between the `` hands '' is only attached to the hands , not the heads of the weapon . this is n't a really big deal , except that it means you ca n't have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand . this could be rectified with 2 small technic pieces , of course , but it does mean you 'd have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere else . overall , a very cool build-it-yourself action figure that could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work , or actually played with . educational value is limited to following instructions and demonstration of structural principles , as in any lego set . durability seems good so far - lego is pretty sturdy stuff
0	this product does not work . the way the toilet lock stays on is suction cups . they do not suction to the toilet . if they do miraculously suction , my 18 month old can easily pull or knock it off with the slightest touch . i bought two , lost the receipts and ca n't return it . i would not give this product away because it basically does n't work at all .
0	bought this in clearance at toys r us , it sounds like junk and poorly made . i plan to return the 2 bought for my twins . i was forced to put one star but would have also left zero if i could . spend a little more , you get what you pay for . this would be best left at the curb , than taking up room in my girls bedrooms ... .sad , sad , sad ... i hate retruning things , it is a waste of my time
0	the nature 's fire volcano also used to be sold at the discovery channel stores . my kid loved it while it worked . lasted about a month . all of the reviews stated the same on their site . lasts from 1 to 3 months . wish i had checked it before we bought it . save your money
0	i bought this for my 5 year old daughter for christmas . she played the sound game . she always got the answer correct , but 60-70 % of the time the bear still said it was incorrect . the rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing . therefore , this is not a learning toy and it is no fun . after trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was , she decided she hated the thing and did n't ever want to play with it again . i took the thing back to the store and got a refund
0	teething two molars and a cold with a croup-like cough for over a week made my little toddler ultra-grumpy and zapped his energy . poor fella could n't even play with blocks or a puzzle without falling to pieces with frustration . i was going to buy 100 balls to put in his baby pool from the summer , but this whole thing on sale was less expensive than a pack of balls . he shuffles around , rolls the balls down the ramps , and dunks them through the rings for hours . no mental challenge , no frustration , and it does n't zap all his energy . it 's made with the same weak plastic a 99 cent beach ball is made out of and overnight the whole thing is visably less inflated -- wish it was a little more substantial . the sides are not sturdy to sit on or to be used to pull-up on . at 31 inches , he can barely get in and out safely . the balls are inconsistent -- one will be thick and hard and the next is so thin you can squish the sides in a full inch . we 're not trusting it to last a long time under everyday wear and tear . our plan is to store it out of the way until the next rainy day , he 's sick or worse , if mommy gets sick ! no need for an air pump . with two of us huffing and puffing we got it inflated in under 10 minutes . take note that some of these ball pits have free shipping -- the shipping on this cost more than the sale price
0	thanks to those of you who reviewed this..i wo n't waste my money . i too remember the good old days when the clasp was metal and you could load up the case and it stayed shut . i 'll stick to plastic tubs that click closed and allow you to see inside . too bad barbie/mattel is missing a great money-maker by going cheap on quality
0	i got this puzzle for my three children ( age 5 , 4 , and 2 ) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked . it requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds , so removing one means it does n't work . the pieces are small enough that i was n't very worried about choking , but why buy a toy which makes you worry ? we were really disappointed .
0	the board for this game is a pain ... half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick . it takes forever and a day to look in the book , locate the letters ' locations , and uncover them too . i love wheel of fortune , but you 're better off playing a computerized version where you do n't have all the hassle
0	my daughter got this for her 5th birthday , and it really looks cute and fun in the box . within 5 minutes of playing with it , the small clip that holds the starfish open broke . in addition , the mermaids and other pieces that come with this toy are microscopic . if your kids are like mine , they will lose the items and bug you all day to help them find it . this toy is really cute , but not worth it . save yourself the hassle . buy the big barbies and pretend there is a big seashell to play in
0	we got this guitar for my 4 year old , she loved it , but it stopped functioning after less than a month , i thought i need to change batteries but even after that it did n't work , now i do n't know what to do with it , i did n't keep the box so that i could return it , very disappointed ...
0	cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review . i am extremely disappointed . the sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around . it is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly . i just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from crayola
1	why people purchase a toy for tikes when it is specifically targeted at older kids is beyond me . always look at the box for the minimum age a toy is best for . that said , all ltto taggers , including this one , have a simple `` grab and go '' game called ltag . all you have to do is pull the trigger twice and you 're on your way . this is early in the manual , way before all the complicated games that frustrate 6 year olds and their parents . i love ltto . i even run a club that uses it here in auburn , wa . but i *always* start new players out with ltag , then move up to hosted games , and then to the more complicated games . never try to start out by hosting a team hide and seek game , 'cus it 's just too much for a young or completely new player . but that 's why the ltag game exists ! just grab it and play ! no messing with the control panel . do n't take a low rating based on an inapproprate purchase as worth much . similarly , take my rating with a grain of salt since i 'm a huge fan . but for kids 8 and up to adults , ltto taggers are a wonderful , durable , and long lived toy that gets you moving and thinking
1	my 3 year old son loves this puzzle and has played with it for over a year . he likes to put it together over and over again , making a `` train '' across the floor . it has really helped him to learn his alphabet , and i highly recommend it !
1	i 've had this high chair for a year now , and i love it . my daughter plays with it every day , and it 's worn great . it still looks as good as the day we put it together . i love that it 's wood , rather than cheap plastic , and it 's a pretty white with pink gingham , which i think is adorable . the material has held up great and still looks perfect . the wood is sturdy , with no cracks . it fits all my daughter 's dolls , including her large cabbage patch doll . if i were going to change anything , i 'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through ( like real high chairs ) . for the most part , her babies stay put , but sometimes they slip down and out . it 's not a big problem , though . our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter , and feel the same way about it . we love the badger basket product line ! i highly recommend this product
1	we have hardwood floors so i bought this together with playzone . i 'm pleased with these mats -- these made it safe for the frequent falls my baby went through when he was learning to crawl and pull himself up . now i put these mats beside his bed , softening his occasional 'dreamy falling off ' his bed
0	we loved this pool for three weeks , which is as long as we had it . this morning , i went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1/4 '' of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool , through plastic . i could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours . a total waste of money
1	my 9 year old son just started to understand this game , we bought it when he was 7 . he would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships . he would say where his ships were . this game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are . it depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game .
0	we were excited for the first bunch of stickers and then my 5 year old wanted to try it himself . it jammed up and that was the end of it . there are no instructions on how to fix it so i threw the cartridge away . do n't waste your money
0	i was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it . the first one that i got did not work at all ... they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes ( we tried 3 different sets of new batteries ) . it is such a great concept , but unfortunately is very poorly made . i was also surprised at how cheap looking the whole thing is in real life .
0	i 've already spent way too much time trying to screw the basket in and hammer the wheel caps on . what a pain in the neck . this was the most expensive cart and i ca n't believe it 's taking this long to put together - not worth it
0	i bought these slippers after reading these reviews , thinking `` they are really cute , how bad can they smell ? '' well , let me tell you on christmas morning they lasted about 20 minutes in the living room before they were thrown outside on the porch , and they were back at the store 2 days later being returned . the smell is beyond awful , and is absolutely unbearable . as cute as these slippers are for your princess , do yourself a favor and get something else . these are horrifying
0	christmas morning , my daughter tears the paper off this toy and is soooo exited . what a disapointment . nothing i did caused the tail to wag , the leg to move and no licking action . i changed the batteries , still nothing . after hours of trying to get it to work , i went on line here and read somebody elses review about rubbing under the collar very hard . finally , the tail wagged , the foot moved and then , it actually licked . what a piece of work , very cute but way too much work . in time , i will eventually rub all the fur off under the collar . save your money
0	i found this toy to be a waste of money . it was hard for my five year old to close or put more than two things in it . it says it holds three barbie 's and cloths but then how do you close it
1	hello , my name is cloe . yes , because i love bratz so much i changed my name from matisyahu to cloe . i love this doll . it beats barbie and ken by a mile . speaking of barbie i also reccommend the singer aqua she sings `` i 'm a barbie girl . '' buy cloe and the others while you can ! ! ! it 's worth it and it will be a decision you will never in your whole entire life , however long that may be , regret
1	i love it ! it 's really light weight and portble . the batteries do go dead without the charger and the pvds should have more then 30 minutes-60minutes . i like this video now alot . calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it 's wonderful . i hope you buy it !
0	my twins loved the similar toy i bought at dollar tree . the one at dollar tree has a duck or pig in center instead of a red mass . i can not believe they charge this much for the same thing
1	it would be easier to keep score on a book that is not glossy or bound ; ink smears , pencil does not show up , and writing in the crease is difficult . they should include a score book similar to the typical baseball scoring books ; spiral bound , paper . other than that , the product is exactly what we were looking for .
1	this is a great doll -- we gave it to our 2-year-old daughter last week and she now carries her everywhere , feeds her , reads to her , puts her to bed , covers her with a blanket , and obsessively pats her on the back and tush . she 's quite cuddly and soft ; you 'll want to hold her yourself . you might expect from the pictures that the arms and legs would be hard plastic like the head , but in fact they are very soft and pliable , and the trunk of the body is all cloth , like a pillow , with a bean-bag tushie . the headband is removable but actually stays on there pretty well . the eyes do n't have those stupid eyelids you usually see on baby dolls , the ones that open and shut when you lift the doll , and that always seem to stop working properly after a couple of weeks . we 'll see how `` maria '' holds up to the kind of punishment our daughter can mete out , but she seems pretty durable . what a great purchase !
0	as soon as i got it out of the box and put the batteries in , it did n't work at all . my husband checked it out and we noticed that the plastic was out of place and the little motor fell out of it 's place . well my husband clicked everything bak in place and the darn thing still would n't work . we returned it the next day and got our money back . did n't even bother for a replacement because is so flimsy we were afraid of getting another one just like the first one . in all it was a great dissapointmen
1	an inexpensive way to have fun , and they have brought smiles to every person who uses them
1	i purchased the miss weather dress-up set for my cousin 's two year old daughter . at her birthday party , all the other gifts were forgotten as she sat and played with the colorforms . the adults were waiting in line to play with them also ! this set has larger pieces which are perfect for younger children . this is the perfect gift ... inexpensive , fun , promotes fine motor and speech/language skills , and has educational value
0	if you want your child to know the true bibical account of jesus ' birth ... the shepherds came first ! an angel announced his birth the shepherds hurried to see mary , joseph baby jesus . they were first on the scene . some chronicle the kings coming as much as three years later . i will return my three sets order the one with the bells whistles and two shepherds ! !
0	my daughter loves strawberry shortcake . this interactive doll and book are uninteresting and do not work together very well . the book has to be on a flat surface and then still does not work well . the doll and book quickly became seperate toys and neither are played with very often
0	i was very disappointed with the durability and time that it took to get this tent set up . it took me about 2 1/2 hours to assemble the tent and then once it was up it could never stay up . the joining brackets could n't hold the poles together and everytime the tent was moved or touched it fell apart . i went inside the tent to put it back together and one of the poles fell straight down hitting me under the eye and cut it . this is why i am returning it . if it 's not safe for me to be in then i certainly do n't want my daughter playing in it
0	out of the box we noticed the table top was warped . when you push on one side of it the other pops up . definately not suitable for crafts or play . returned it that night
0	this marble maze looks so fun and cute . however , it 's actually useless and incredibly frustrating . the pieces do n't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them -- much less when you try to roll a marble through them . also , the configurations pictured on the box do n't work at all . either our giraffe is missing a critical piece , or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate . ugh , i 'm returning this immediately
0	this high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies . when screwing together the sections , i managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest . any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy . this toy is very basic , the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth . invest in some power tools and make your own , i guarantee it would be better than this one
0	i just purchased it for my 3 year old granddaughter for christmas . my kids played with it 30 years ago and loved it ! i am so disappointed to read these negative reviews on it now . please ... someone say something good about it ! ! ! i hate thinking that i wasted my $ $ $ ! !
1	i purchased both of the mega bloks pyrates ships and have built two other mega bloks vessals before , namely the man-o-war models from the dragons line and they wer both more difficult to construct than this one so if you want a challege try finding them instead . the first thing i noticed when i opened it up was the lack of pieces in the set , almost the entire ship simply snaps together , a ten-year-old could do it . there is n't a lot of rigging like in the playmobil series that will keep coming undone either . all in all it can be assembled in 30 min to an hour . the finished products are full of detail and mega bloks has gotten better at it each time , anyone who follows their dragons line will know what i mean . i 'll post a review of the phantom next and i caint wait to get the privateer ship blue beard 's avenger it looked massive at toy fair . with the pirates of the caribbean 2 and 3 films coming out this line is sure to be a hit
0	i gave this to my fiance for christmas , who loves sudoku and video games , so i thought it would be a brilliant combination . he was excited , but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play . he ca n't always tell where the cursor is on the board , so if he sets it down for a minute , he ca n't see where 's he 's left off . then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train , he could n't see anything either ( backlight would be a nice feature ) . it just seems this model is not designed very intuitively : he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number , but it clears the game . all that to say , 2 million puzzles sounds great ... unless it 's too frustrating to play
0	my daughter just turned seven and we got these for her birthday because she loves to be outside . she thought they were cool for a few days and now they are sitting in the garage . we put the appropriate number of strings on for her weight ( 56 pounds ) but she does n't seem to bounce very high . and she needs help getting them on . she was upset because some neighbor boys made fun of her due to the fact that they are so big and awkward looking . i would n't tell someone not to buy them but i wish i would have gotten something else for her .
1	the girls liked this doll . the wings are velcro so they can make her into a princess or play with her as an angel- they like that . great buy from amazon
0	my little brother received this toy as a present , and constantly had problems just keeping the toy together . he barely had any fun with it , since it fell apart most of the time . my brother is generally good with toys , and he has fun with practically anything , but this toy proved to be the exception . you could buy something much more fun for the same amount of money
1	our whole family loves this game . i like this version because it includes the history and rules of the game on the inside cover . i also like that you can close the cover and not lose the dice . the construction is a little flimsy and there is not enough felt on the board which makes the dice rolling a little noisy . we added a piece of felt on top of the board and it is much better
0	i 'm more or less fine that they changed a murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time with what beverage . buying this for kids and all that . its not as intuitive or intrinsicly interesting , at least to me , but hopefully it is to kids . however , they also changed the mechanics of the game from adult clue , and not in a good way . the `` room '' variable for example , drops out . its not relevant . its who ait the cake at what time with what drink . it just feels silly to set up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is irrelevant . the idea is probably to change the mechanics to make the game simpler . well , the problem with that is it was pretty simple in the first place . and the change sort of makes it more complex in a way . you need to remember the rooms where you already checked tokens . now the sheet does list the rooms , you could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens . but since the rooms are not otherwise relevant , its not intuitive to track the rooms where you checked tokens . the game is also incredibly cheaply constructed . for example , the `` die '' does not have numbers on it , you have to put number stickers on it . and the board is n't flimsy -- flimsy would be an improvement . anyway , not recommended
1	i give this toy low marks for educational value for two reasons : first , humans were not contemporary to the brontosaurus , and second , the egg is too big to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set . my mother sent this toy as a gift for my son 's first birthday . the package suggests this toy for ages 2-5 , and in typical fashion , my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself , but my three-year-old daughter was immediately and completely enchanted with the toy . she began role-playing with the dinosaurs right away . `` i love you very much , '' said the mama dinosaur to her baby . supercute
1	i got this puppy first on accident , trying to get a love and licks puppy . this puppy far outshines love and licks . it actually works without much effort . nose gets magically cold and it wags its tail without much effort . great first puppy toy for a child
0	my daughter , age 9 , purchased this product after seeing on tv the many ways she could create images on paper as well clothing , backpacks etc . upon opening and struggling to assemble it , we realized that it was useless . it is very difficult to use on paper and i can not imagine using it on an item such as a jacket . i emailed the company to complain and after 5 months they responded with a standard - return it to the store you bought it at ( an option i did not feel we had since it had been opened and used ) . they should have just said `` tough luck ( ... ) '' . save your money , avoid this company and get a bunch of stencils instead .
1	i am so glad i bought this puzzle for my 3 year old ! the pieces have the most beautiful pictures on them and the larger sized pieces are just right for toddler hands . this is one of those toys that you 'll want to keep forever
1	great poseability and a fun transformation . the super robot mode helmet is a little goofy looking when it 's on but other than that he 's fantasti
0	we were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday . after opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied . however the screen is very disappointing . i ca n't even rate the games because overall i simply just ca n't see what is on it . the product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing . i should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products . i would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it
1	i first became aware of `` eat it '' through an article in the washington post . my family enjoyed playing the game so much that we invited the creators of `` eat it '' to appear at an event in our local community . it is a game that truly the whole family can have fun playing together . my seven year old daughter , emma , was thrilled to learn that one of the questions asked in the game was about a candy bar that was called `` fat emma '' , and was hoping that it was still being sold , ( it is n't ) . great game
1	i bought this for my son for christmas , which at the time he was only 14 months old . the age says from 18 months . the problem is he ca n't hold the button down to make it go so i have to walk around the train and hold the button for him . we had a playgroup over and there were kids that were over 2 years old and they could n't hold the button down either . overall my son loves it but its not age appropriate for him . also , this toy is cheaper at toys-r-us . i got ours when it was on sale for $ [ ... ] . after christmas they had them on sale half off for $ [ ... ]
0	after the safe arrived my son was very excited to use his new toy . unfortunately , one of the key features the toy promises , setting your own secret code/combination to open the safe does not function . neither he or any of the three adults in the room were able to reprogram it to the numbers he chose . he was very sad about it but after waiting so long for it to arrive by mail , would not return it . since it arrived at my home i have researched other reviews at amazon . you already have product reviews stating the same complaint . this is not an inexpensive toy and it does not work as promised . it should be taken off your item list until it has been fixed . as it stands amazon is selling a low quality item to young children and parents who are very disappointed .
0	what a disappointment ! we got this for my daughter because of the enticing tv commercials that make it appear to be fun , moldable and not messy . however , it is none of those and is very messy ! it is just a cross between dust and sand and not fun to play with or to clean up . it stays on your hands and a child can easily wipe their eyes and cause problems . go with play-doh or floam instead
1	after assembling a dora 's talking cash register that scans the wrong items , a dora 's talking backpack that is just plain dumb- this is the toy that scored this christmas ! this toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect . plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker . my daughter does n't even question why it only talks in the walker . so what if it does n't ! it will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on . i would recommend this toy- very cute and fun !
0	i bought this for my nine year old daughter . the game in theory is great , but ours does not work right , and the company is not real great to deal with . i am still trying to get a replacement . if the game worked properly , i would rate it 5 stars , easily . even my thirteen year old daughter loves it
0	my daughter received this for her 4th birthday and i must say we were terribly disappointed ! this `` sand '' did nothing but make a huge mess of our play room . there was dust everywhere and nothing the kids tried to make stayed together . ugh ! as it is `` sand , '' when it gets on the floor , there is no way to easily pick up the pieces except with a broom or vacuum . we put it on newspaper to contain the mess , but boy was that a mistake . wet newspaper and dry sand ... ... ... ... we 're going to take it back and get some good , old-fashioned play-doh instead
1	the concept is more or less the same as the standard monopoly . the product is good and is worth the price . its nice to have the family members sit toghther and njoy
0	i got my any farm last year happily i opened it ... .and took every thing out in one load.i filled out the form and got my ants i decided to slowly put them in ... outside ! well 15 of my anties escaped and 2 bit me ! ! ! after a good fight with them i got them in and brought them in.my finger was burning.but , the next day i woke up and all my ants had died that night.i was soo mad i threw everything away ! *sings and skips off
1	i love this doll but the only complaint i have is the eyes why are they looking to the right ! mattel please if your gona make more then please put the pupul in the middle . pleeeeeeeeas
0	well , this game is fun but i ca n't believe some people thought that it would actually take you into space ! well , its kinda stupid you just take apart a house puzzle according to some stupid card . but still , the game is really fun . -- - delane
1	we got this for my daughter for christmas and she just loves it . the music is a little loud but she highly enjoys it
1	great little wagon ! ! the canopy is nice and the fold down seats are very useful
1	i think that the soccer ball is great but not that educational only because all you do is paint
0	pro : easy to visualize the numbers on the screen . cons : the biggest negative draw back is that the keys are not very sensitive . you have to push very hard and often multiple times to get a response . this is very frustrating- the help keys does not help at all . do not buy it , it is a wasting money
1	i bought a set of these uno cards for my 9-year-old grandson , a nintendo `` freak . '' the first night he had them he played three games with whoever was handy , and spent an hour alone arranging the cards just so . he took them to bed with him . a few days later he dashed into his other grandparent 's house showing off his fancy deck of uno cards and insisted that they play a game . he even wrote us a thank you note telling us that the cards were the `` coolest present i ever got . '' the rules of the game have not changed , just the look of the cards . nintendo characters , in all their bright colors , are the `` suits . '' the cards are housed in a metal box , a throwback to the front half of the 20th century . excellent art work on the cards and on the box . the cards and the game are appealing to all ages . i enjoyed playing and getting acquainted with the nintendo characters ( my grandson explained them all to me ) . this is a great family game and this nintendo set is a great gift . it helps close the `` generation gap . '' i highly recommend this item . enjoy . one last thing : i bought a second deck for another grandson and his response was pretty much the same .
0	i think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush , but i immediately encountered some problems with the toy that i think are worth mentioning . first , the battery box is very poorly designed . once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog 's tummy , it 's nearly impossible to keep it closed again . the dog 's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open . now , if i handle the toy , the box keeps falling out ! my second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad . the sounds quality is poor and it does n't always sound like a dog
0	i completly agree with what everyone else said about this ... do not buy it ! ! ! i wish i had read here first ! ! ! we bought two of them and one stuck for 2 days and the other did n't even last 1 day ... .we tried for days to get them to stick and they just wont ... we had thrown out the boxes so we could n't even return them ! ! ! i ca n't imagine why they continue to sell them ! ! !
0	i purchased bean bag toss for my four year old grandson , it was his birthday , it was absolutely no challenge - no fun and required absolutely no dexterity . very very disappointed , if it was possible to return it i woul
1	this is one of the few toys , it seems , which has remained fundamentally unchanged since we were children . the push-stick is shaped a little differently ( i remember a thin blue broom stick with an orange or red handle ) but otherwise , it is the same . no electronic sounds or flashing lights have been added - although you can get it that way , too , if you want . personally i think these things detract from the imagination building aspects of certain toys . i 'm not saying we have no talking or musical or flashing toys , but it dismays me when these things are added to the classics ( think little people farm etc ) . what i love about this toy is it can be anything . it 's a sweeper ! it 's a carpet cleaner ! it 's a mop ! it never fails to crack me up when my son comes running after me with his corn popper when i am cleaning . it 's a lawnmower ! so many jobs around the house or yard can be copied with the corn popper . and if mom or dad is n't up to much , it 's still great fun to run around with which means exercise for the kiddies . it 's a solo toy and a playing-with-other-kids toy . any time we have other children over to play , the corn popper comes out as they chase each other about the house . we got this toy when my son was 13 months . he is now 3y4m and still playing with this toy . i have seen 5 and 6 year olds still playing with the corn popper . there are few toys that are so simple and yet offer so much fun . sturdy , too - very important as it 's bound to be crashed into a few walls . i ca n't think of another toy which will give you more bang for your buck - unless you count dirt and measuring spoons and all those other free things that kids so exasperatingly pick over the toys you paid good money for . i am a little alarmed at the current price listed for this toy , though . you should not need to pay that much for it . occasionally this item becomes hard to find - especially at christmas - but usually there are tons of them in the stores for around the cost of a president hamilton . right now this is listed for twice that .
1	i added this toy to my son 's xmas list . with much luck he did get it ; and we are pleased ! i would not say that it 's a `` fun to play with '' toy but the entertainment value still exists . the planets are large enough without being overbearing up on the ceiling . they glow at night..which is the best part ! ! at 36 years old i ca n't wait for nighttime to hang in my sons room to check out the planets ! the stars the set comes with are perfect . they are not the bulky plastic ones that can be seen day or night . they are paper stickers that disappear during the day ( on the celing they do anyway ) the planets come with name stickers which adds educational value . my son is five and loves , loves , loves these planets . i say get 'em ! ! lisa avilio-meyer
0	it would be really nice if they could put out sets in single ethnicities . i do not like my child having multi-cult propaganda shoved down her throat via her toys ! she wants to play with dolls that look like her - this is only natural . too bad , cute set and i would have bought it
1	the is one of the fastest and easiest to learn games i have ever played . the first time we played was on christmas day . we had 10 players that ranged from 16 years to 77 years and everyone loved it . we played for over 3 hours and decided we had to stop to eat . it is also a great way to break the ice . i would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a big game player or a beginner , this game ca n't be beat
0	we bought this gadget for our 2-year old . to risk sounding like a broken record -- or faulty spinning plastic toy , in this case -- i 'll just add my vote to the design flaws : 1 . volume . not only is the volume loud , it 's unbearably so . even my daughter grabs her ears when she 's playing on it . the voice is a bit garbled as well , so when the command 'ready..spin ! ' sounds more like 'wordy ... spew ! ' i prefer to spare my daughter 's hearing loss for live concerts in her teenage years , so i 've disabled the on/off switch . 2 . spin quality . a sit n ' spin should have a fluid , effortless motion ( like a lazy susan ) . this toy requires enormous effort to turn . to add to my daughter 's frustation , the handle 's base gives a bit ( even with screws tightly fastened ) , making for a tedious experience rather than the joy ride we loved as kids . spare the expense and the frustration of fitting this thing in the garbage can on collection day -- buy an easel and finger paint kit instead .
1	my three year old son is just discovering thomas and from reading other reviews and speaking with veteran mothers of thomas fans i realized how important collecting the different characters is in order to reenact the scenes from the videos . this set made a nice addition to his growing collection and the price was nice too . the wooden trains are a bit exspensive but are well worth it in the long run due to the fact that they will be played with for years to come unlike most other toys that children outgrow or become bored with almost as soon as they recieve them
0	if you are planning on getting a good deck then do not waste your time with this..it has the essentials , sure , but your money is better spent at one of the 4 `` structure decks '' ! ! they are much better than this..i can say so beacuse my sis owns this deck and i can beat her every time : ) konami needs to put some better stuff in this deck - like senju of the thousand hands x 2 . also they need to take away the change of heart since it 's `` advanced '' forbidden . but still , this deck deserves an ok rating since it has all the essentials..this is no better than the first yugi starter deck . so if you already have a starter deck , do not get this as it is not worth it - a lot of weak non effect monsters .
0	i am not too happy with this item . it has a handle , yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot . it is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out . and the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use . other than that , it is attractive looking and constructed well
1	this is an attractive toy for infants and toddlers . the music and lights are nice .
0	i purchased this item for my 5 year old daughter who loves barbie . it is a simple game , but maybe a little too simple . she got bored with it really fast . she played it once and never again . the board was very flimsy and not made well
0	the doll is a great gift for little girls who love dolls.my 6 year old loved the doll.i do not like the way allysens hair sheds when you comb it.when allysen asked when is your birthday ? my daughter had to keep repeating herself , when allysen asked what is your name the same thing happened.so my daughter got stuck with happy new year as her birthday and sweetie as her name , when you ask allysen to read her book she asked for a smoothie , she is also very loud , my daughter slept with allysen and carried her around everywhere she went.when allysens batteries died she went back in the box
1	the v4 , the newest american tamagotchi , is much like its previous japanese counterparts , the entama and uratama . this tamagotchi goes to school , interviews for jobs , and then has a career . each career has its own game , so there are many more games on this tama than the v3 . there is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail .

1	imaginext dinosaurs ' t-rex is quite simply fun to play with . the dinosaur not only is a great toy , with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar . it comes with a catapult with its respective stones ( 2 ) that the caveman ( also included , with accessories ) can operate , to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino . my 3-year old picked it up since he got it , and he has n't let go
0	bought this for daughter for christmas , and when i opened the box and saw the cardboard backing , debated on returning it . but they love the pegasus barbies , so figured okay , let 's try it out ! is really beautiful when all put together , and my daughter loves it ! but , that stupid cardboard backing . nope , no way does it stay on at all . am going to tape it to the wall behind the playset , and it will be fine . right now is just standing up behind the set . really , could n't they have made a plastic piece with a big sticker with clouds/pegasus horses on it that attached to the back ? when assembled , the whole thing will fall apart if you literally move it a couple inches . my 3-year old daughter understands this , not to move it , and so far she has been fine with it . i showed her myself moving it and it falling apart , and said see , do n't move it , okay ! ? but when it comes apart , is very easy to pop the sections back together - which in my house , the kids play with toys for a while , and then i like to put things away in the closet for a bit - which this i can easily break down some of it to store , and then in seconds have it snapped back together again to play with . yes , durability-wise is a piece of junk - but a beautiful piece of junk , and is worth it if your child loves the pegasus barbies
1	i do n't know but mine has stayed together for the whole year nothing broke i had to fix the couch a little but i forgot to snap in the little thing into the front . but nothing broke and i 'm not rough on it and i pick it up by the handle nothing 's wrong with it though
1	i just bought this doll @ toys r us and i was also able to purchase the hilary duff shopping sisters doll which is supposed to include her sister haylie duff which is n't available yet . i have the two other hilary dolls the first of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a lizzie mcguire doll which does n't look much like hilary at all . then there was the hilary dolls released by playmates which had a more slight resemblance than the first doll . now mattel has made a doll of hilary duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll i 've seen . and the clothes and accessories are really cute too . i think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans too . i 'm just waiting for the haylie duff doll to debut early next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance . the dolls are available @ toys r us , kb toys , wal-mart all under $ 20.00 .
0	we were extremely disappointed with this toy that we bought as a christmas present for our four year old son . the parking garage came with pre-drilled holes and needed to be assumbled . unfortunately , due to poor quality , the pieces did not line up correctly and we needed to sand some of them down in order to make the toy functional . it would also have been helpful for the manufacturer to include one or two spare screws in case they got lost or destroyed during assembly .
0	unless you buy the multi arcade machines with all the major games including mr. do and do it right- the classic collections on playstation ii are the best . unfortunately for plug and play some of the versions are jerked to very difficult levels and not as fun to play . the monsters in the pac-man games are almost always on kill including following you in the tunnel a lot of the time . the problems listed with the joystick seem to be accurate . galaga was better and mappy was a lot of fun to play- the most underated classic in arcade history . but again it 's better to get the collections for playstation ii
1	i remember playing this game as a kid . im sure glad someone still makes it . good family fu
1	this is the third or fourth quixo game we have purchased to give as a gift ! we originaly recieved ours as a gift about 5 years ago and it has been a favorite ever since . quixo is tic tac toe with pieces that move . you have a strategy , then oops , your opponent chages it all with one move . it is suitable for anyone from age 8 to adult . we keep ours out at all times - a coffee table game . it is very high quality with real wooden blocks as playing pieces . enjoy !
0	this trike in useless ! our 2yr . old tips over every time she tries to ride it . buy something that 's worth the money and safer ! now our daughter wo n't go near the thing , or any other trike ! i expected much better from radio flyer
1	this game is fun for the family . it 's very simple and can be played by young children learning to count . it 's not overly exciting by itself , but you can make it that way with your own spin on sound effects
1	webkinz pets are an excellent choice for a child who wants to use the internet and a parent who values internet safety . the pets are adorable and my children are addicted ! fun for parents too !
1	my son loves this instrument , but i think he likes another saxophone that plays tunes when you press buttons better . this one relies on the child to blow and press the keys , like a real instrument , but does n't sound like a saxophone
1	i think this a great item for a child over 3 1/2 . since there are 4 puzzles in one box , our son , who just turned 3 has a hard time keeping the pieces separate . they are symbol coded on the back , so i think once he gets older it will get easier . he loves the pictures and i love that the pieces are sturdy and how much he is learning . highly recommnde
1	these are really cute and a great alternative to the standard `` numbers and letters '' version of these foam tub toys . my 2 and 3-year old sons enjoy playing with them . no complaints here
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen . my daughter loved it when she was 1 . now she 's turned 2 and she 's lost interest in it , like many other `` baby toys '' . i had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can `` cook '' with it
0	my son received this car for christmas . it worked the first time we used it but we noticed that if we forgot to switch the car to the off position when we were done the batteries would die . each time my son wanted to use the car we would have to replace the betteries ! the last time we tried to use it we changed the batteries in the car and the remote and it wo n't work . so now it 's garbage !
1	pefect addition to any little mermaid collection . very durable plastic , not too many little pieces . clothes for dolls could be easier to take on/off
1	my son received this toy as a present from his father on christmas ( dec '05 ) and he was able to play with it straight out of the box . i bought my son the v smile system and he ca n't use that as easily as he uses the read with me system . while a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old , it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right . while with the v smile system he prefers i play and he watch . so i am happy with this purchase and will buy more dvds for the system . i have only one complaint and that is i wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters . my son loves thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could i think he would also like to see thomas the tank engine , dora the explorer , and maybe even some books in foreign languages . but all in all a great system for the younger preschool children .
0	yo brannan , relinquished does not fuse to or more monsters . it lets you equip oppontents monsters to it . learn yugioh you ... error ! ! ! my favorite cards in pegasus deck are toon world , relinguished , and blue eyes toon dragon . i gave the durability 2 stars because when you leave your cards in the sun in the car , they get in bad cond . you know that annoying snap action . the only thing i do n't like like about pegasus deck is that theres not that many high attack monsters . i would reccomed deck protecters . also buy a kaiba evolution for megamorph . in pegasus deck use seven tools of the bandit you lose 1000 lp . then use toon world . you lose another 1000 lp . special summon blue eyes toon dragon . then use megamorph . 6000 lp for your toon dragon . then use toon special ability . your opponent losses 6000 lp and he/she probobly will lose . lose 2000 lp with seven tools ! megamorph is worth it ! ! ! ! hope my review was helpful . p.s . brannan this is a good review .
1	this is the only figure in the apocalypse series that dose not have a variant figure . kinda makes you wish it were the sentinel series , and if you can find them , most of them are variants that you might actually want . i was fortunate enough to hit wal-mart at a time when the shelves must have been just stocked , because the racks were full , and all five variants were right there in front . needless to say i bought all 5 . but maestro , as far as i know has had one appearance in the entire marvel universe , so what variant is even possible . despite some protests that this is `` another hulk figure '' this is not some namby pamby rehashed hulk with screaming action , fist pounding , and slightly purplier pants that we 've seen a dozen times before , but an almost entirely all new figure . one reviewer said the body was based on the smart hulk figure , but i was n't lucky enough to snag one , so i do n't have a basis of comparrison . however , he is well muscled , warty , and weathered alot like he looks in the included issue of captain marvel . and if your wondering just what exactly to do with him , fear not , captain marvel is to be released in series xv near the end of this year . then he can go a few rounds with your maestro . now ml , where 's our legends 2099 spidey ? ( he was also in that cm comic . ) he is a good figure , could be a little bigger , like more on scale with juggernaut from series vi , but he does come with the apocalypse piece whcich is a great figure in and of itself
1	my mother-in-law purchased the sandbox for my son , who was not quite two at the time . he has played with it everday for the last four months straight . i ca n't even hide it from him . he loves filling the sandbox with other trucks that he has . this toy keeps him occupied for hours . he has so much fun with it that we are using others for his second birthday
1	we had a simpler and earlier quercetti marble run . this was an upgrade/add-on , and well worth it . the motorized elevator keeps the action going . a five year old will need help setting up , but can operate the final run easily . safe pieces , easy construction and good directions . fun , even for the adults
0	it is just like mr . potato head except not as many pieces . there are n't very many options to dress sbsp , but he is always a fun toy . after a year of play , he is a little torn at the edges , but overall in good shape .
0	my son loved this tent . he fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent . my only beef with it is that somehow he 's bent the frame of it so now it does n't sit right on the floor . actually it does n't sit on the floor at all because of where it 's bent . the tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support ( similar to what keeps the top portion rigid ) at the base of it to keep the `` legs '' ( there are n't any but that 's the best way to describe them ) apart . the tent would also be better constructed if it did n't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side . if the wire gets bent there 's no getting it back into its original shape , unless you take out the stitching ( around the whole tent frame ) and repair it then restitch it , but who has that kind of time ? overall it 's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build . i 'm glad we got it as a gift and it was n't something we spent our money on
0	there are lots of little pieces , and the rules are a bit complex . i played it with my nephews ages 7 and 5 and they both had a hard time staying interested for the length of the game . however they have both asked to play it since , so they must like something about it :
1	the maestro , the evil future intelligent world conquering version of the hulk , comes with one arm and arm tube of the mighty apocalypse . apocalypse being the kick butt 14 '' giant figure you can build if you buy the six figures in this series . maestro hulk has great paint and body sculpt with tons of detail and his muscles are so huge it looks like his skin may burst . his beard is scuplted and painted well and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald head . he is a touch shorter than i 'd like and this plus the swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you . overall a really cool figure and someone to take on the first appearance grey hulk from the galactus series . talk about alpha and omega
1	my 3 year old daughter has this dress up set and it is great for little hands that are not coordinated enough yet to dress and undress actual barbi dolls . she loves changing their outfits and switching their accessories - and i love that she can do this without any frustration . mellissa and doug toys are made with the quality of older toys - they are well constructed and made to last - and the sturdy box allows for easy clean up and storage .
1	if you do n't have this i feel bad 4
1	the suduko board game is the perfect gift for the older kids on your lists . it is well made and can be played by one or two so they can use it alone or with friends . since it is wood it will last a long time whether it is being played by middle schoolers or college kids . also , i paid $ 17.99 for this and have not found it anywhere near this price . it is usually $ 29.99 to $ 39.99 for the exact same game
1	i received this promptly and in time for vacation . was great for the kids in the car . they loved the stencils that came with the board . many hours of fun . they like that they can make skid marks with the lightning mcqueen car
1	great fun for the family or a group setting . we 've had hours of fun
0	this is really the dumbest thing ive ever seen . yu gi oh is such a rip off . get something good . * anime princess chick * - age 1
0	yum ... play food ! this is a great set . i will buy it as soon as i find it . this is a great set ! lots of cans ( good for storage ) , ice cream , boxed treats , cookies , ( yummy ) , and of course , much more . and who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs ? and is that chocolate chips on the ice cream ? oh my gosh , it 's better than i thought . you might think that to have a good time , your child needs 40 dollar melissa and doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a fisher price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play . bullpies , i say . i have tons of dollar-store food . i have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set i got . i prefer the dollar store food . dollar store food is better because it has more in one package , looks real , is cheap , pretty durable , and looks nice . i have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop ( small , but the knobs turn ! ) , a pink and purple propane tank , a can of `` barracuda '' ( seriously ) , and a can of `` barracuda hash '' which included barracuda , ham and eggs , chicken , turkey , potpie , and more eggs . but the logo has spam and a hotdog , and the front of it has beans , turkey , fish , sausage , and lots of weird meat . but it says `` eatable , 100 % dainty , present ! , daintiness , dainty '' . just wanted to let you know . so , bottom line is , dollar store play food is much better than you think it is . it comes with lots of things that the expensive companies would never have dreamed of
1	this is a challenging game , even for adults . it 's great for getting both sides of your brain going . questions range from easy to difficult and topics cover pop culture , history , and science . great game to play with teams
1	if ya trade toon worldu can use toons as regular monsters and the it wont make yacange the other guy plays toon world it jes works for if u play itand it plays on on the opone
0	we bought this for our granddaughter 's 2nd birthday 03/16/07 and had the item delivered to our house a month ahead of time . we took the items to their house to assemble it . we founds missing parts and 2 side pieces were the same , when they should have been '' a '' and `` d '' . we got 2 `` d '' pieces . part `` q '' was also missing
0	growing cps from seed is not easy ! and growing cps in a terrarium is even harder ( they need full sun , wet soil , and a special soil mix ) . they grow native from texas through the carolinas and do not need the tropical environment of a terrarium where fungus will attack and kill . this terrarium set up is doomed to failure . cps are actually very easy to grow outdoors with a little proper instruction . obtain your plants or seeds ( takes years to get a decent plant via seeds ) from a reputable online nursery ( i have bought several excellent plants from sarracenia northwest ) and then search the web for proper growing instructions . skip this item and the goofy terrarium domes at walmart .
0	i recently purchased this pad set for my # 22 radio flyer wagon , but had to send them back . if you check the radio flyer web site , you 'll notice that the # 22 wagon sides only have two wide slats . when i received this pad set , i noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats . the loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats . since my wagon only has two slats , and they are wider , the loops were in the wrong spot and were n't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon . i 'm only guessing , but i think these might be for an older model of wagon
1	completely satisified with the product received . it was received very quickly after placining order . well satisfied with product and service
0	i bought this for my daughters 6th birthday . the lips on the doll did n't work and there really is n't much to do with it . she was bored almost immediately . i was hoping for much more out of this toy . in my opinion you should n't waste your money
0	i had two problems with this item . first , the planter is very small ( only about 6 inches in length ) . secondly , it never grew ! i bought it for a first grade science experiment , but the class was very disappointed because nothing happened . this item was not worth the money spent
1	this is a beuatiful dining set . true , it does n't come with the pony as it clearly states in the product description , but we have too many already . anyway , i would recommend it for the crystal princess castle or you can even use this with other doll houses
1	nuparu is sweet ! but , sadly , his skull does not glow in the dark . nuparu has black/gray armor , a light up sword with a strobe effect , two claws , and a zamor sphere launcher attached to his back . you must be careful with the zamor spheres , though , because they 're easy to lose . now i have toa matoro and toa nuparu ! you havr to buy this toy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	this game is make-involve , make-think and fun . side effects leave you much smarter . its fun game for parties driving everyone to involvement and fun . art of asking questions and elimination gets better and better just by playing this game ! ! ! ! ! . strongly recommended for parents who want their kids to spend time on creative and learning game , yet fun . they can be be part of game and share there thoughts . though it recommends age 10+ might as well be good for 7+ to 100+ ... '' i wish i had this game little earlier , never stop telling how much its fun and good for personality development ! !
1	i gave this as a gift to a friend who is a huge fan . i 've never seen a 29 year old so happy as he made the whoosh noise as starscream flew around in jet form . great quality , durable , and fun to play with
1	my children loved this toy for all of ( 1 ) hour . my only complaint is the material . you can probably guess this punctured almost immediately . i made sure to clear debris beforehand and it seems something very small wounded this toy . i 've refilled it but i 'm a little apprehensive on where to let my kids use this . it seems that it takes very little to disable this toy .
0	i just bought this game and tried for 3 hours to make it work on 3 different t.v . sets - no luck . i ca n't even give it 1 star because i do n't know how fun it is ( or might be ) . i tried every `` input '' available on every t.v. , i tried changing the batteries , i tried hooking it directly to the t.v . as well as thru the vcr and dvd player - nothing worked . i guess i know why it only cost $ 5.99 .
0	my child loves geotrax and plays with them everyday . however , big city lights makes your track look good but does n't have much for a child to interact ; the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer . unlike other pieces with geomotion this one is a bore . my child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the rc trains go under it .
1	bought this one recently for my eight year old ( and myself ) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it . more challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games . i highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing , thinking spatially , understanding the consequences of a move or moves , and introducing the concept of strategy
1	the little mermaid pop-up castle was sold out everywhere this past holiday season selling at $ 34.99 . i found it on amazon for $ 26.47 and free shipping ! my daugher , 3 yrs old , just loves it . the accessories are very tiny , like the tea pot and tea cups . tiny like your pinky fingernail . we all love it ! easy to put together , but i think it folds up , i do n't know how though
0	it has lot of problem , most of time it 's cartridge will not be recognozed by leap pad .
0	after reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble . we were very disappointed . the packaging arrived torn and open in several places . only a few screws came with the table , not that this made much difference as there were table parts missing too . the parts that did arrive were chipped practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off . amazon were efficient in having the item picked up for return and refund
0	i agree with the other reviews . my four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift - none of the pieces stay together - at all . how do you explain why the gate wo n't hold together - why the horse wo n't stand up , why the barn doors keep falling off - and what do i say to the gift giver when they see it
0	my daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday . she loves tub toys , but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water . my daughter actually plays with it more out of the tub and my husband figured out that it actually works better if you pull the tail and let it swim on the floor . i 'm a big fan of sassy toys , but i 'd pass on this one
0	i bought this for our 3yo son who loves heavy equipment and digging in the dirt . this is a cool toy as far as being a pretty good replica of a real one but it does not work well in dirt or sand . fine sediment gets caught in tracks and after a short amount of time , the tracks quit turning . then the handles on the arm do not move the bucket well . my son has since ripped off the tracks and does not do any digging with it but still enjoys pushing it around . do n't buy this if you want your kid to actually dig dirt , it would be good inside toy or outside but away from dirt or sand . but , i think it was intended for playing in these areas , so the rig is not that well designed .
0	we finally bought these barbie magic of the rainbow dolls for our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing them beg for it repeatedly after each time the commercial aired . at first , they were very excited to play with them . positives : the doll is durable . it encourages participants to follow instructions . negatives : i notice my daughters have to wave the doll a few times before the dvd `` hears '' the instructions . positives : the dvd provides clear and easy to understand directions , so your doll can be programmed with your remote control . negatives : the doll set off our fire alarm a few times before we figured out it was the doll ( and we did check to see if there really was a fire ! ) when the dvd is not in , the dolls control the volume on the tv ! this can be very annoying when the volume increases just as you realize your daughters have started playing with the dolls . my suggestion : de-program the doll when your kids are finished playing the dvd ! or , just keep it deprogrammed and use your remote -taking all control away from your kids and keeping them from standing so close to the tv
0	the dress featured on this particular set shows a girl in a flowing blue and pink gown ... you get the blue and pink gown , but it 's not what 's pictured on the box . it sort of looks like it , but it is a flimsier , straight version of the one pictured . also , my daughter just turned 4 . she 's on the petite side , and is around 32 lbs . this dress just fits her . hope this info helps
1	yasmin , one of the super-stylin ' bratz rock angelz , is in my possession ! so , i 'm sorry my reviews go in to every little detail ( as one customer complained ) , but that 's how i do it ! so if you have n't bought a ticket to info-town , either get the heck outta here , or buy one by reading this review . here goes ! first off , yasmin has blonde streaks flowing through her dark chestnut hair . just like the other rock angelz ( cloe , jade , sasha ) , yasmin 's hair is awesome quality ; smooth , great duraility , etc . that feature makes her great for younger kids because her hair can get messed up many times , then smoothen out . yasmin has the liveliest color eyes of the rock angelz ; emerald green . this works as both a strikingly gorgeous feature and hot highlight to the doll . her lip color , pink , really stands out on the doll . and of course , as most other yasmin 's do , she has the warm cocoa skin color . she has dark blush and sparkles above her eyes.i absolutely adore her chocker . it is too cute ! i 'd definately say that her jacket has a 70's-80 's rocker look to it . it 's definately the best piece of clothing on this doll . just beware that it 's difficult to fasten the velcro in the back . the velcro on my yasmin doll 's jacket is practically coming off ! underneath her jacket , yasmin sports an undershirt labled 'rock angelz ' , with the ever-so-famous red glitter included . her jeans have no rips or anything . they 're just jeans with white stitching , red glitter , a chain half-belt , and little frayed bits at the hem . now do n't get the wrong idea ! just because this doll has a chain , leather , frays , and a belly-jewel ( so not a tatoo ! ) , do n't go thinking , `` oh no ! this doll portrays an image of bad things for our 'little ' girls ! '' she 's just a cute rock star singing inspiring songs and wearing totally appropiate clothing . now , of course , if you still think this doll is innappropiate , it 's not my place to order you to buty this doll . i just wanted to epress my opinion ; this doll is safe . anyway , her black guitar is in the same mold as cloe 's red one and oriana 's purplish one . it 's a little difficult to position her guitar correctly , but not thouroughly impossible . her second outfit consists of sparkly mini and rockin concert tee . yasmin 's ankle boots match with both outfits . and i love the fact that both outfits are mix-n-matchable ! it rocks ! literally ! her accessories include : glasses , 2 sets of earrings , cell-phone-necklace , bracelets , star brush , lipstick , microphone/microphone stand , and totally-collectible displaying stand ! you 've outta have a rockin ' time with this rockin doll ! she 's 100 % worth the price ( $ 19.99 ) ! fortunately , i got her for christmas . in my opinion , she 's appropiate and meets the standards of all ages ( notice i stressed on the 'all ' ) . you 're lucky if you get her ! great job mgae ! chelsea ( 50 % my scene , 50 % bratz ) over , out ! ! ! ! ! p.s.-end the war ! ! ! - # 1 peacekeeper ( hannah ) 12 year old fan of my scene , bratz , barbie , and polly
1	i keep this on my desk at my office , people love it , and it a lot of fun to watch them during the day . i highly recommend
1	i have been in love with this game ever since i first played . it was a favorite at choir parties over the holidays in chicago . since i have moved , i keep one copy at my permanent address and another at my vacation home . it is great for all ages . we are very loose with the rules and find teams the most fun . it does n't matter who wins . as long as we play , play , play ... we laugh , laugh , laugh !
0	my daughter was thrilled to see a new wheel of fortune game out and we bought it immediately ! it 's quite abit smaller than the original..ca n't imagine why they would do that..and it already has problems with the bonus round ! we may just have a bad one..but my daughter has gone back to using the 20 year old one she has..even with the faded screen and weak sound
1	this game is awesome ! it is addictive though so be prepared . a little complicated once you get started , but becomes easier . best if someone already knows the game to teach it . really fun though
0	i paid over $ 7 for this thing , bought it thinking it was going to be bigger than the ones that come with the set , and then i get it and it is tiny ! you can get a much better deal on the extra large ones at lego.co
0	i can not believe radio flyer put this bike out ! every single time my 2 year old got on this thing , it toppled over ! i actually called radio flyer , they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model ( then i found out there are plenty of angry parents out there ! ) after some resistance , they agreed to refund me and they did . the back wheels are too close together , making it very easy to tip over , plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable . i tried it too in the store on smooth ground , but on the sidewalk , forget it ! please save yourself the trouble !
1	my 2 year old and 4 year old love this playdoh set . i recommend it highly
1	this is the perfect size swimming pool for my 21 month old . she loves this pool . i love the fact that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start filling it with water - it stands up . less risk of tears or holes ! the only thing i would recommend would be some sort of cover for it since it does not come with one
1	a retooled mold brings this 60s sci-fi kit back to the hands of today 's kit builders ! not quite accurate to the sets miniatures of the original show ... the passenger compartment should have 2 more seats , the control yokes are not included with the pilot 's console , plus the top dome is round instead of teardrop-shaped ... but these are all true to the original aurora model . would n't take much to fix the mistakes , as there are plenty of references replacement decal sheets out there ... or just build it `` as is '' for nostalgia value
0	i bought this game hoping to have another great game for my girlfriend and i ( we became bored playing backgammon all the time ) and we are disappointed . this game has nothing to do with any lost cities ... . it 's just a card game that requires you to stack cards in numeric order to get points ... you group the cards by color ( which are supposed to represent cities ? ? ? ? ) and eventually the game ends after a certain number of cards are played and you tally up a bunch of numbers , divide that by pi , and then take the square root of you birth year and multiply that by five to see if you have either earned points or need to subtract them . then you do the math for your partner . we tried to play it a few times and it was just kinda dumb ... . ( the points ar n't that difficult really ! ) , but this game was a waste of time and twenty some odd dollars . i suggest you take the $ 20 and buy a bottle of hooch , and have some real fun with your partner ... unless you are 8 years old ... in which case this game might be fun . just terrible
0	this game is a clever combination of uno and rummykub . very entertaining and can be played with kids as well as adults . it allows me to add my own special `` rules '' to make it more interesting . if you like cards , you 'll love this game
1	this toy is pretty stellar . i mean , you can play battleship anytime you want w/o having to ask someone else to play with you . it is awesome for long trips or just something to do if your bored
1	my daughters ( 4year old , 2year old and 9 mos ) love this toy . the keys are a little hard to hit but they seem to really enjoy it . the baby enjoys trying to play it but likes watching her sisters play it more
1	my 3 years old son like 's it but put 's it together in no time . not so hard
0	my son loves the color wonder line by crayola , so when i saw that they came out with a new creation called color explosion , which is another marker-type of product , i knew i had to try it . now , i wish i 'd saved my money . first off , you should know this product is not for preschoolers . color explosion is recommended for children 6-years and up . now that i 've played with it , i concur . i came upon this product when arrangements were made to watch my 9 and 10-year old nieces for a week . i thought the color explosion would be a hit , and i planned to treat them with this `` art '' related project throughout the week . they were excited to try it , and once i settled monkey boy , my 5-year old , with a project of his own , we got started . at first glance , it looked to be a winner . the girls were having fun . then , we started another page , and the markers became icky . gummy is probably a better description . the markers were covered with a black film , which caused the images to look splotchy , and streaky . crayola suggests you wipe the markers off with a paper towel , so we did . it kept happening . for instance , we 'd draw a short line , and then we 'd have to wipe the film off again . then , we tried to wipe off the images with a paper towel . that did n't help either . color explosion is too painstaking for a child 's activity . we began to realize that it was n't a blast , but a bummer . crayola warns against moisture , but even fingerprints will spear the pages , and the film comes off onto your hands , the table , and everything else . oh , and if you use the glitter set , it clumps , and mixes with the film , and makes a liquidy black goo that stains fabrics . the company warns about staining , and suggests washing immediately , but come on . did they even test market this product ? what i thought would be an entertaining venture , turned out to be a messy disappointment .
0	we had it for two weeks then it broke . the screen flashes on and off for no reason . nothing happened to it -- it just started doing that . very weird . no online support available from fisher price for this system either . i bought several games that can not be played now . the kids liked it while it lasted though . we also have a leapster which has lasted us eight months so far . my boys like it much better too ! ! so if you 're going to buy a learning system i would recommend the leapster .
0	i just ordered the world of little people sweet sounds from amazon . i have n't received it yet . i paid $ 200.00 for it . now i can see it 's selling for $ 139.00 . i 've also seen it for $ 32.00 . what 's going on . is there a difference in sets ? i 'm not sure , but i think i acted too quickly . can anyone tell me if there is a difference in the doll houses ? did i make a big mistake
1	i bought these for my 5 year old son who is a huge car 's fan . he was using matchbox cars and pretending that they were lightening mcqueen and friends , but when he recieved the set of these he was so excited . these cars are larger than matchbox cars , and are heavy for their size , good quality ! ! great for the car 's fan in your life
1	thease dolls are ok i agree with the other reviewer that the third edtion is wayyyyyyyy better roxxi is kinda ugly lol phope is nic
1	maybe it 's my computer or browser , but the picture here does n't do this doll justice . i bought one at my local drug store before i saw it here at amazon . i can tell you that this beach glam barbie is gorgeous ! the picture here looks faded to me , but i have the doll right here in front of me , and the pink accessories are a lovely perfect shade of vivid pink , not pale or washed out as it appears to be in this photo .
0	this playhouse theater is an excellent way to spark your child 's imagination . my son received this as a christmas gift last year and it has not only been a theater , but a house , cave , secret hideout , restaurant , and schoolhouse . very colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening writing skills ! the only downside i have with the theater is that it is not very durable . the theater is made of some sort of flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws , etc . it slides together and a child can easily disassemble it . the front panel that the child rest 's his/her arms on broke after two weeks of having the theater . other than the durability factor ... great product
0	we looked for a trash truck that our 4 year old boy could play with . on the surface , the bruder looked the part . not as cartoon-looking as some , the fact that it looked like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made it seem like an ideal choice . actual play testing though shows this product is n't very well-built , at least not enough to withstand normal wear and tear . this truck was n't subjected to being thrown down the stairs , jumped on , etc . it 's been just played with , but it started coming apart quickly . the hinged door in the back of the truck is a poor design . the plastic hinges on the truck are too thin , and break easily . the plastic hinges on the door start to bend after multiple open/closes , and the plastic weakens and breaks off . the hinged front compartment and rear sections are difficult to operate , and stick easily . items put into the cab ( like the essential green army man who drives the truck ) easily get caught in here and are very difficult to remove . worse though is the key point of this toy , the ability to latch the trash can to the lifting/dumping mechanism . this is way to complex for a child , and the intricacy in getting a solid connect is difficult even for an adult . if it 's not hooked up right , the can falls off when you try to lift it ; very frustrating . some little pieces ( rear view mirror , etc ) broke off easily and early on , but we kind of expected this . the parts were simply too small and fragile to last long . i do n't hold this part against the design ; part of the attraction was that it looked like a real truck , and i do n't think there 's an easy way to add small details without some fragility . while this is orignally was one of my sons favorite toys , he ca n't really play with it the way he 'd like to . while he still enjoys driving it around the house , he ca n't pick up the trash and dump it without an adults help , and that 's a shame . for the price , i expected so much more .
1	my six month old enjoys this . it can keep him occupied for 10-15 minutes at a time , and the music is quite pleasant and soft . good toy
1	this is such a great toy for kids and parents . we play play doh for hours . the barrel is a great toy . all the item inside are really well made and they have a lot of cute shapes . this really is somethig fun for kids and parents to enjoy together .
0	i bought this basketball hoop for my son who was two and loved to shoot hoops . great height for a small kid , but difficult to adjust , latch always got stuck . also , after a few months , the latch broke right off . now i have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son . now it is just a $ 30 peice of trash
0	the game was not nearly as sturdy as i had hoped . a piece broke off as i was putting it together . too sensitive to touch . would n't purchase again for an 8 year old
0	what on earth are you thinking ? nobody is going to pay that much for this game unless it has a portal to the deminsion of toyland .
0	i bought this game on the fly cause the cover illustration looked so interesting that i could n't resist . the instructions were a little confusing to understand at first , but once gameplay started it was picked up pretty easy and much fun was enjoyed by everyone . the game is geared for those ages 10 and up , but it was so easy to understand and so much fun , that my 8 year old neice was able to play without teaming up with an adult . the game promotes math skills which is a huge plus since many games today are only about fun . this game has it all , fun , education and the artwork on the cards is fantastic . when we played , we threw in chocolate gold pieces so we 'd have real pirate plunder and everyone had to speak like a pirate . it 's a really great way to spend quality time with your family and it 's fun for all ages
0	this elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night . i had to ship the first one back to fp on my own dime to get a new one , that one was broken as well ! the cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the abc part does not work . this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on ! what a pain ! shoddy electrical work . i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat . make sure you get this garbage on sale !
0	my title says it all . the black balls fell off of the sticks within a couple minutes of normal use ; therefore the toy was also a choking hazard . the balls would n't even glue back on effectively because the ball openings were clearly too large for the sticks they were matched with . cheaply made and potentially dangerous
0	i would have bought this item , but the shipping ( $ 5.53 ) was almost as much as the item itself ( $ 5.99 ) . thanks , but no thanks . i 'll go to a competitor . weird thing is -- other play-doh items are listed with free shipping
0	this is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old not 8-11 as it states . talk about a waste of money . i returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the christmas tree this year . it was a shame the description was n't more accurate , because i was not refunded my expedited shipping costs i paid for this `` toy '' thumbs dow
1	we got this when my kids turned 3 , however could have gotten it when they turned 2 . we play it every day . it tells you which player 's turn it is , it also counts the number of spaces you are suppose to go with you and then it says `` you 're on the 'yellow ' space '' as a double check . there are 2 modes and we can play on the `` difficult '' mode ( the difference being with the easier mode you only have to know colors , with the more difficult mode , you have to know the alphabet ) . the characters are really cute to . best of all , everyone is a winner - yeah ! a concept that is difficult to teach a 2 or 3 year old , but this games does a superb job . the computer chip knows what space you are on so it makes sure that everyone wins within 2 turns ( that i 've experienced ) , so those with little patience can `` wait it out ''
1	this toy looks great it has the house which kids love and the climbing par
0	the videos are not useable except in the leapfrog leapster . i did not know that until i received the order ! thanks alot leapfrog .
1	the doll looks nothing like the aidan in the movie . actually , his face is kind of funny looking . the movie aidan is cuter . the doll could definitely have been made better
0	very disappointed , this item never got shipped to me , we waited close to 2 months to find out it was n't coming
0	i purchased this car for my 2 year old son for christmas . shame on me for not taking it out of the box and testing it out prior to christmas morning . the car lights up and makes sounds ( very annoying ) but did n't move an inch . i replaced all batteries - still no movement . the manufacturer was of no help . thank god someone else also got him the chicco remote control car - because it works ! steer clear of this stinker
1	my husband and i travel a lot and someone told us about this on one of our last cruises.. we actually watched 2 people playing it as well . so my husband actually remembered the name of this game and got this for me for a christmas gift . surprised me ! ! we plan on taking it with us on all our trips . we will be able to use it on cruises , on planes , wherever we may have to play the waiting game . we know its good for 2 people on up ! ! ! it seemed like a fun game
1	i definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game . unfortunately , that absolutely is n't always the case . one of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the 80 's was super password with bert convy . the game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle . this edition does n't reflect on that edition . this board game edition is a example of the original password with the late allen ludden . the game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually have n't seen the original password like myself , but it is just delightful . unfortunately , it is n't much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the bert convy edition . hopefully , when password is remade , it will be just like the themed 80 's edition of the nbc game show . price : b- game : c 1/2+ fun enjoyment : b- overall : c
1	this chart has been an excellent way for our children to track their daily progress towards completing their weekly chores and an excellent way to begin the work for allowance process . only draw back there really is n't enough room to track chores for more than one child
1	i got this for my 6 year old son with moderate autism . what a god-send ! he uses it every day , for several hours . i bought the speaker accessory so he does n't have to use the head phones all the time . it is so easy to change the song list . he is able to use it independently , except for pushing the song vs. story button . the icons and ability to customize the icons have made it so he can quickly search for what he wants . i found the drawing screen for the icons challenging at first- but even me with my lack of artistic talent was able to accomplish the task so he knows them . i would give this my highest recommendation- very tough player- dropped who knows how many times- yet keeps going . the best thing i 've purchased for him in a very long time . well worth the money .
0	i purchased crazy croc even after reading all the bad reviews , but my son really wanted it so i bought it for him for christmas anyway . it was the worst gift i 've ever bought ... .please do n't even waste your money ... .trust me , check the reviews first , now that 's worth it ...
1	i bought this toy for my 3 year old son before his baby brother was to be born . he absolutely loves this doll ! i babysit during the day and he took care of his baby right along with me while i cared for the baby i keep . he had regressed and started wetting his pants again when i began babysitting but is now going to the bathroom on his own again after getting this doll and having his own baby to care for ! the yawn as some other reviewers have said does sound a bit weird but it is only a doll ! if the baby is not attended to properly to make her stop fussing or to put her to sleep then she 'll eventually just do it on her own so it 's not frustrating for my son , great for younger kids . my husband did not want our son having a `` girl '' doll and i ca n't find any clothes to fit the doll to turn it into a boy so my only wish is that this doll was also made as a boy or at least boy clothes were sold for her .
0	even though yugioh is dead , this is my favorite pack ( even though i don ; t get them any more ) . the deck that i made is an archfiend deck , which can kill you if you do n't have a spell card on the field that says you do n't have to pay life points for archfiend cards . they are also one of the strongest group if cards . there is terrorking archfiend , infernalqueen archfiend , archfiend solder , and others . even though yugioh is dead , some people still play ot , and some stores but them from you . i sold my deck for $ $ $ , you should too .
1	i do n't have the tin version but an earlier version . the cards look different but the game is played the same . i have been playing this with my now current 10 year old for 2 years and we both love it . a little luck , some strategy , and a whole lot of fun . do n't let the age levels fool you-adults will enjoy this as well . a classic that will never go out of style
0	after waiting for 1 month to get this toy i can not tell you how disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it . absolutely this thing is a waste of money ! it is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it . the image is impossible to see with any amount of detail . do not buy this toy ! i would give it zero stars if i could
0	my daughter wanted a doll that goes in the water last christmas . i chose this one , and she was so pleased . the doll is beautiful . she did not quite sit the right way in her raft . someone needs to hold the raft while the doll is in it , or it will tip . my daugther did not like that we could not just dry the doll off with a towel , so she could take it around the house with her , but that it had to hang and dry . still she loved this doll and it was her favorite , until two months later when the material around the leg wripped . instead of trying to sew it , i figured it was cheaply made and the rest would rip also , we said goodbye . this year i am getting her another doll that goes in the bath , but i am getting the paul drink and wet doll by corolle . it is a lot more expensive , but i think it will be worth it .
1	the wooden corral is so simple it encourages hours of imaginative play . it is just the right size for my child 's horses to play in and can be easily set up anywhere . yet it is very compact when folded for storage .
1	i read about this rc racer in family fun magazine and it got best toy for 10-12 age group and they were right ! it is alot of fun to put together..not too hard , but a good challenge ... it can also be made into a different model , we went online to lego and got the directions . it is also sturdy , maneuvers , speeds up to 13 miles in hours and can take all kinds of terrain including snow jumps . the battery has given us about an hour of hard driving.the remote is alot of fun to use . i loves it ... its spendy , but i 've already had hours of fun
0	the concept is perfect . it is small but fit my bigger 3 year old okay . the pedal mechanism is difficult to master , but doable . the steering is for slight turns not any sharp turns . i rated this item 2 stars because the box was obviously opened prior to me receiving it . it most likely was a returned item . it was also defective with the metal rod for the pedal mechanism totally disassembled . i fixed it but then the other medal metal rod came apart as well . the product is very cheaply made , but the sound effects and look is perfect for a batman lover . i have written to etoys , and i will see how they respond . my sons loved the car nevertheless
1	me and my bf loves this plug n play game `` wheel of fortune '' , we bought it at target store . thumb up for this one and plenty of words .
1	i was recently in the play alladin , and whenever there was a break , the whole cast would gather to play `` encore . '' we used songs from the musical we were in-and talk about a boatload of laughs ! it 's a blast ! everyone loves it , because everyone gets involved , and has a great time . this is a fabulous party game ! buy it now
0	had 3 leaks all in the seams ! could not patch correctly even after waiting the `` 30 mins . '' to re-infalte like the directions stated . my son was extremely upset . from other reviews , it sounds like there is a 50/50 chance of getting a good product
0	first of all , the quality is horrendous . second of all , the rules are so nonsensical and complicated . i had to change the rules just to make this game playable and enjoyable . you think that they would make a better game for loyal friends fans . i guess not . at least the questions are good . they are not all extremely easy which makes it fun to pla
1	i bought this set for my 3.5 year old . we have had a great time putting it together on several occasions in the last couple of weeks . once put together , my son imagines adventures on it with the included soldiers . i am not very mechanically inclined but the instructions are excellent , well-illustrated and clear , and i had no problem with them . ( my only quibble is that the orange sticks in the manual are a different shade of color from the ones in our set , and took a moment to identify . ) at first my son just wanted to put together the foam walls , but the second time around he wanted to help constructing the walls of the castle . by imitating me , he was able to make duplicate versions of some simple structures rather well . he also figured out how to make the soldiers all by himself , with their arms , legs , helmets , swords and shields . through doing the set i also was able to explain that you have to build the foundation first before you can put in the walls and floors , and the third time we made the castle , he was repeating this point to me ! the drawbridge is really fun and well-done . it raises and lowers very smoothly . this particular set is really only designed to make the castle , so it 's not really meant for making many different things like the other superstruct sets . but this was our first one and i have no regrets . assembly time was about 30 minutes the first time , but after you do it once it seems closer to 15 minutes . the pieces are high-quality , fit very well , and are generally a joy to handle and see . the castle looks great once assembled , and will impress any adults or kids who see it
1	i understand the people who install car seats who feel this item is n't needed and distrust its lack of crash testing , but my infant car seats are hand-me-downs without latch . my car has latch , but does not seem to have the kind of seat belts that stay tight . my car seat does n't just get a little loose ... you can move it 4 or 5 inches side to side if you try . it may be that a car seat tech could train me to do a better job with the locking clip , but i ca n't get it to stop this . and one of the seats was given to me without a locking clip at all . i have no problem tightening the seat belt enough - it just wo n't stay that way . this product allows me to tighten the car seat enough to meet the `` one inch '' spec . nothing else has . so it definitely adds to my baby 's safety . finally- to the car seat techs- with the number of these that have been sold , it does n't appear that anyone has come forward to say that it failed in a crash . just because it has n't been crash-tested does not mean it is unsafe . and there is absolutely nothing wrong with aftermarket goods as a rule , tho manufacturers will always tell you otherwise
1	this was the best therapy game ever . my girls bought it for me , a gift because i love board games . we mostly played it with their friends . i have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me . i decided to bring it to a family gathering . i have always been distant with my eight siblings . the game started out with the kids and my sisters ect . then when they saw i was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played . we had a total awakening of how we see each other . we have never been closer , since that game our communication has been wonderful . this game is the best . we laughed so hard we ached the next day . we played till 2:00 a.m. our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home . we started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we 'd just be an hour or two . lol i have been instructed to bring the game to this summers get-together
1	... and they are working out great with our thomas layouts . melissa doug products continue to impress me with their high quality and typically provide great educational value . these are educational and your children will learn things like police station , fire station , hospital , school , town hall , grocery store , and post office . there are several different shapes too , including squares , rectangles , triangle , and the various signs . the buildings and most of the roof pieces only have the building design on one side . the trees , ambulance , fire truck , and mail truck are large and double sided . the various street signs , and passenger cars are a little small , and as the box states ages 3+ and up , i would consider these smaller pieces a choking hazard . the larger pieces are enjoyed by both my 1 yr old and my 3 yr old . the rectangles are the largest piece in the set and measure 4 3/4 by 2 1/4 '' approx . squares are roughly 2 1/4 x 2 1/4 '' . these blocks are not as heavy as i expected , but still nicely made , and bright colorful additions to playsets like thomas/brio train sets . if your children do n't insist on the real thing , this is a great way to save some money and still buy a quality product . the only drawback is the wooden storage box does n't come with a sliding plexi cover like the melissa doug pizza set or beading set does . that would be really nice for storage and secure those little pieces that we do n't use
1	i was unable to find this product until now and it was great ! ! ! delivered fast and absolutely no problems ! ! ! !
1	my 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it . he plays with it just about everyday . everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too . they all love trying to make baskets . the flaws are that it is loud and i wish the baseball and football did more or made noise . they do n't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises . overall it 's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained !
1	i just gotten this yesterday for my 12th birthday and i love her so much ! she is beautfiul and her hair is so soft , the clothes are adorable and she comes with a poster that comes in a accesorie bag for all of you bratz kidz accessories ! this doll is the best ! i am going to get the other bratz kidz for christmas ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i agree with all of the other reviews about this tent and its durability , however my daughter absolutely loves it . first the three plastic sticks that come with the tent to hold it open broke and warped pretty quick . i went to home depot and bought three wooden dowels for 79 cents each and cut them to the correct length and it works great . my daughter uses this mostly inside and it is fine , when outside the wind and everything else did move it around . i bought a 4 pack of plastic tent stakes from target for about $ 1 and put one in each corner to hold it in place , works great . i think we paid $ 19 for this at target and it definitely seems worth the amount of enjoyment my daughter gets . if you are expecting a $ 200 high quality camping tent , you will probably be disappointed
0	when i received the doll i turned it on and she made about 4 or 5 facial expressions before she said a word . she is not operating properly and since i ordered the doll a month and a half beofre my daughter 's birthday , i was unable to return or exchange . i was told to contact the manufacture . i guess the doll was mishandled before it reached me ... be careful
1	it 's soo cute and cuddly ! not only is extra soft , it 's small enough to fit in your palm or make a great addition to a desk . it looks realistic too , it had the little cat fur covering its eyes making it even more adorable , the only downside if you trying cuddling with it to go to sleep make sure you take out the `` ty '' tag otherwise you would end up with heart shape marks on your face=
1	a wonderfully complete set for toddlers to set up a complete dinner just like mommy daddy . the pieces are easily recognizable and realistic . the children enjoy sharing the dinner with their `` friends ''
1	my son can not wait to get a bigger set . compared to other magnetic building sets geomags is , by far , better quality although it is also more expensive
0	the truck gets clogged up often , it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load . the tower is decent , albeit , it does n't quite work as advertised as well . our kids wound up just knocking down the dominos the old fashioned way . i grew up in the `` domino rally '' days and compared to the original toys , these do n't stack up . the truck and tower just are n't worth it , you are better off buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own domino trails
0	i bought this for my 7 year old son . it did not take long before the a and b buttons became stuck in the down position . the games were not that challenging for a 7 year old . but he thought it was great when the a and b buttons fouled up , he said it made it more of a challenge . dad thinks the thing is a piece of crap
1	i love light sabers , i got 13 years all if you think you are big for one of them let me tell you that you will be a kid onlly once so get one an play , i bought one of the basic light sabers and they are so cool , this saber is the best , you can fight and the saber will not get damage , i like it very much . i got a green and black and my brother a blue and black so we can fight . the light saber full extended is like 3/4 of a meter but it do his job . the electronic light sabers are to fancy and they get broke in a moment . the force be with you .
0	it really is not what i was looking for , but the children have found other uses for it
0	we bought three of these over the last few months since they keep breaking . the last one lasted a single afternoon , and the kids were upset when it broke yet again . its not made very well ; dont waste your mone
1	every time i see my twin daughters riding these bikes around i make a promise to write a review of the product . here i am fulfilling my promise . they were able to pedal the bike within 2 - 3 days of getting them . they are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that i can carry both in the back of my small car ( 89 chevy camaro ) and are light enough that i can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike . the only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns .
0	the parts of this set are not well made - light , flimsy plastic . the highlight of the set , the battery-operated hairdryer , worked for a few seconds and then never again , even with fresh batteries - i suspect due to poor connection . the cover for the battery compartment was badly made and did n't sit well . the rest of the items included are nothing to write home about either . i bought this for a christmas present for my dd and sent it back for a refund
0	my 15 month old daughter received this as a gift , and i have to admit she loves it , but it has nothing to do with the product design . she would love any toy shopping cart at this stage . she just loves pretend cooking , eating , and feeding her baby doll . this toy is so shoddily made it 's laughable . some of the included foods to put in the cart are actually just cardboard boxes that wind up torn and in the garbage within the first 48 hours . the cart basket is too small , the baby gets stuck in the seat , and my daughter gets frustrated when parts of the cart fall off as she plays . it 's not going to last long . the best parts are the little milk carton and the banana . check out other shopping cart toys ( little tykes or small world toys ) . we bought her a set of wooden fruit ( melissa and doug ) . when this shopping cart dies , we 'll buy her a sturdy one and add more wooden food toys ( there are some excellent sets available ) . my advice is skip this one and buy your child something better the first time around
1	we bought this puzzle for my then 2 year old as he had mastered the barn puzzle ( which is also amazing ) . there are monkeys , tigers , butterflies , and numerous other jungle animals . i had to look up several of the animals as i was not sure of what they were . this was a good educational experience for both me and my son . this puzzle is durable as are all of the m floor puzzles . it has been stepped on and thrown across the room by a highly rambunctions child . i have had this puzzle for over a year , and it looks great . i rotate this puzzle with the other melissa and doug floor puzzzles that we have . i recommend any of their floor puzzles as they are great quality and have easy to handle pieces for kids . they are a great opportunity to teach about different subjects and teach new words to children
0	it lauches the marble so forcefully that the marble bounces off of the ramp it is being lauched to . instead of using it for the fridgits set , my youngest son used it to launch m 's ( but that 's another story ) ..
1	i bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it ! the music quality is great and she really enjoys the lights . it has a very sweet face and she smiles and talks to it a lot . i got it on clearance which is good because as cute as it is , i do n't think it is worth the original price . i would definately recommend it if you can get it on sale
0	we purchased two of these safes for our daughters for christmas and they both broke within 3 weeks . do n't waste your money ! ! ! !
0	i agree with the other people who wrote a review ... ca n't figure out the sequence of events or maybe stylus does not work . child not happy and tired of hearing shortcake say the same thing over and over . save your money and buy a good book for your kid ! !
0	this game is not for die hard fans of friends . the game bored me in 5 minutes . you need to watch like three episodes to get most of the questions correct and a lot of it are common sense . i was not at all challenged and did not enjoy playing this game and want to sell it back after playing it for 30 minutes . do n't buy it
1	my son received the smartville ice cream shop for his first bday . he played with it all the time . we bought him the rest of the set for christmas . this is definitely his favorite toy . he is 15 months now and he plays with this set almost all day long . this is one of the best things i could have bought for him . he understands how it works by placing the characters on the round spots . i feel it will be a great teaching tool for when he is ready to learn the alphabet and his numbers
1	i purchased this card game as a spur of the moment christmas gift for my son who loves monopoly but can get no one to play the board game because of how long the board game version takes . my son as well as the rest of the family was wonderfully surprised to find this monopoly card game addictive and fun to play . each of the hands goes quickly and the goal of $ 10000 is very attainable to reach in a fairly short period of time . i will have to admit 3 people was a bit more challenging and fun than just 2 and we decided it would be easier to keep score of the money by using pencil , paper , and a calculator . overall , i highly recommend this version
1	this game is so much fun ! ! ! i do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels . in other words ... if you are a huge star wars fan like me , then you will love this game ! ! ! it will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level . another thing i think it could use is maybe a game-save function or something ... anyway , great gaming experience ! ! ! one and a half thumbs up ! ! !
1	it 's a nice pool..a pain in the ass to blow up without a pump but oh well . lol it 's a good tuy over all to have and holds a lot of water . it 's just hard to dump it all out once you 're finished..that drain hole should be on the side and not on the bottom of the pool
1	excellent product ! i really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve . after playing all 50 , you can just start all over again ! fun , fun , fun game ! thanks
0	i recently purchased the magic touch n ' crawl pooh as a christmas gift for my best friend 's 7 month old little boy . i was so excited to read the rave reviews ( with only one mentioning a mechanical sound ) . to my dismay and disappointment when pooh arrived and was started , he sounded like a car wreck was occuring every time he turned his head ! i was extremely disappointed and promptly returned him . ( i must note that amazon.com does make returning a purchase extremely easy . ) please be aware of this terrible sound that is much louder than the music that plays when considering purchasing this product
0	we received this item as a gift from grandma because my son loves barnyard animals , barns , etc . he loves the tent ; however , the construction was so poorly thought out that he can not touch it without it falling over and collapsing on top of him ! there is no way to anchor it to the floor ( weights , etc . ) to keep it from toppling over . the sides have no stabilization whatsoever . the idea is super , but maybe they should consider more product testing to ensure its durability
0	the fine print on the box tells you this is a `` multi-terrain '' vehicle , instead of an `` all terrain '' vehicle , this is because while they advertise it to go through sand , and grass , and mud , what they actually mean is that it will go through dry sand , such as you would find in a desert , dry grass , such as you would find on the african savannah , and dry mud , such as you would find in their fertile imagination . mine has shorted out and stopped working just going through dewey grass .
0	i did not purchase this doll from amazon , though my daughter received it as a gift -- the real swimming mermaid . do not buy this doll ! ! ! she took a bath last night with it and it did not swim ! it did not even move a bit -- except for sinking to the bottom of the tub . my daughter was ultimately disappointed and now we are going to try to take it back and get the disney swimming mermaid doll . buyer beware -- this doll is not what you think
1	this game is very exciting for my son , he is five , i am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer . i enjoy watching him do the math ( one with the coins ) as well as watching him make words .
0	as stated by the other parents on this item this belt is a cute idea , but it is so small it barely fits my [ ... ] . it will only fit him if he is not wearing a shirt and even then if he bends down it sometimes pops off . he gets very frustrated and so am i . if i have to re-velcro this thing again i am going to scream , and he only got it this morning for easter . i called fisher-price but they are closed for the holiday ... i plan on calling again tomorrow and i will be getting some sort of refund ... .hey maybe i can score a free field journal . haha ... good luck to you all .
0	very cheaply made.my children broke it after only four months.the back wall broke off along with the top roof.the furniture also broke.the people 's hair came off.this house was a big mistake.i wish i had purchased a different one.this house is very cute , but not sturdy enough for preschoolers
1	my 9 year old son loves dragon mountain . he was n't able to assemble it alone ; eventhough he 's typically very good at assembling most other toys . it took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it ... but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together
0	my mom says that coffee is bad for you and it makes your teeth yellow . why would you want to teach your kid to drink coffee at the age of 3
1	for scrabble aficionados with children who often travel long distances by plane this game is a must travel accessory
1	this set of crayons is very durable colorful ! it comes in a cute organized pouch which has 4 zippered compartments that fold togehter and velcro shut . the crayons are excellent quality , comparable to crayola . young kids and adults will enjoy hours of fun with crayons . create things to your hearts desire . highly recommended product and great for travel too !
1	my 2 year old daughter recently recieved this as a present from her grandparents . she loves the disney princesses and was ver excited . i was happy to see how easy it was to put up and take down , she plays with it in her room almost everyday and i love the fact that we can take it down before she goes to sleep . overall we are very pleased with this tent , although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that i could play in there with her
1	she 's crazy about horses and loves this set . she 's creating whole scenes with the pastures and horses . great se
1	this is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics , ms. pac man , which plays as close to the arcade as you can get , pole position , which the joystick turns as a stearing wheel , again close to acrade action , mappy , where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum ( much like original mario brothers ) , galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit , and finally xevious , where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see ( plays like tiger heli for nintendo , or other games like this ) . i use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available , works great , passes the time with family friendly games . these games are much better than some of the new expensive games . check this out , you will be pleasently surprised , and for around 6-12 dollars , good deal . runs on 4 aa batteries , then plug and play
0	i bought this toy for my 4 year old grandaugher . since barbie rides this horse of course a little girl will want her doll to ride the horse . the wings fall off . we must put the wings back on at least a dozen time a day
1	amazon [ .com ] recommended this game for me , based on the fact that i love the game set . unfortunately xactika bears a strong resemblance to `` 10 to 1 , '' a game played with a normal deck of cards . if you already know how to play `` 10 to 1 , '' xactika may seem derivative . after trying xactika once or twice , we threw it in the drawer and just played `` 10 to 1 '' instead
1	this is a very beautiful doll . i love dolls , barbie and i also love angels . unfortunately this doll is also veryyyyy expensive ! i woudl love to have her but not at this price . i will wait until the price drops or i will look for her on e-bay . i will not pay over 40 dollars for this doll . no matter how pretty she is ! i do giver her 5 stars though . very nice doll
0	talk about a waste of money . first of all what is tyco thinking . $ 70 for the toy and you have to buy the battery pack separately ? ! ? ! ? ! not to mention i could not find the battery pack anywhere . all the stores were sold out . all web sites ( toys r us , kaybee toys , etc ) were sold out . all other sites ( specialty hobby shops ) had them at ridiculuous prices , which did not include shipping . i finally found it at amazon.com at a reasonable price and i opted for their free shipping which took longer than i would have liked but at least they have that money saving option which helps . my son played with it once and hated it . it was his # 1 choice on his x-mas list . talk about a big disappointment for us both
1	my three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection . we did n't use it as a game . you can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties . each would take a turn 'ordering ' types of donuts and the others would 'make ' them . yes , the frosting wo n't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play ! box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue . would buy this again . great for kids with imaginations
0	what a super-cheap rip-off of the original rubik 's cube that was introduced to us in the mid-'70 's . seems like every doctor 's office , break room , friend 's basement , etc . had one of these cubes to kill time with . main reason that i , personally did n't like this modern version was that after the first day or two , the colored stickers start to peel off . the rubik 's cube had it 's day . in this high-tech age , i can not see many kids having any interest in this item . they might actually have to 'use ' their brain . please do n't bring back the pet rock
1	my 6-year-old got this for christmas and he and his 4-year-old brother love it ! they enjoy doing the battles and coming up with different monster combinations . it teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations work best . my kids also like to just play with the figures by themselves like action figures . a piece of advice though : this game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it wo n't be much fun since the point is to create varying combinations . therein lies the problem - or at least my problem ! i ca n't find the extra figures for this thing ! luckily , they were available around christmas so i got some then , but now i ca n't find them in stock anywhere . also , i have not had any durability problems although i had some sound quality problems on the 2nd day . fortunately , it turned out that all i needed was new batteries . you really need alkalines for this game . overall , it 's what my boys think though and they adore this ! ! !
0	i 'm here to find replacement parts for this toy . my daughter was working really hard to try to make something work on this , and right when she got it together , one of the wires attached to the light broke off , when she tried to put it into the coil to make the connection . we ca n't solder it back in , there are no replacement parts and my daughter is crying at the kitchen table and we do n't want to order another one , just to make her happy . seriously , this toy is a piece of crap . i gave the toy high marks for educational value , because it teaches kids an important lesson . once corporations have your money , they do n't care about whether or not you actually were able to use it , or have fun , or will need replacement parts , they only want to get more money off you , somehow . also , buyer beware is an important lesson .
1	ever since my son was 10 months old he just had to check out the vacuum whenever it was out . so we decided to get him a toy vacuum for his birthday . since we use a canister vacuum i wanted to get him a canister vacuum as well , and this was pretty much the only one out there . he just loves it , and since he is under 3 , ( the recommended age ) , i took the long gray pole out of the vacuum so its just his size . ( the head fits fine straight onto the hose . ) he knows how to turn it on off , but mostly likes dragging it around . he also likes taking the two attachments out . and i love how this vacuum has no real suction because then it would not be safe for my little one . the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he loves this toy so much that he wants to drag it everywhere . and that can be a pain- ( to the car , in the highchair , on the changing table , etc . ) so i 've had to hide it sometimes . : ) but i am very happy with this vacuum
1	i would recommend this game to any and everyone completely . i would have to say if there are choppy portions on your dvd player then it might be time to buy a newer dvd player . ours was flawless ran so smoothly and it 's sooo much fun . most fun with multiple people but still fun with a few . i would only hope that in the future they put a few more games and also maybe full motion video instead of pictures of products . never got tired of the game and like i said i recommend it to everyone . thanks , b. wolf west chester , p
0	ok , maybe that 's a bit strong , but this is hands down our most hated toy ( by the adults , and the kids are plenty frustrated , too ) . we received it as a gift ( and wow whoever would pay $ 35 for this is crazy. ) . our son is nearly five needs help to load the truck , which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming ; a time-consuming procedure , since the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time . the dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end , and are prone to easy collapse . after the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear , and that 's something i 've never even contemplated before
1	my children ( 4 6 ) love this game . it is great because no reading is necessary . the game asks the questions and even repeats them when necessary . while my kids do n't know all the topics covered they enjoy the game . the fact that the game makes sure they move the correct number of spaces is great too . i definitely recommend this game and i will probably buy the next level of it .
0	there are many significant shortcomings in this interactive dvd game . i do not recommend it at all . it is not at all like the real feud . the most frustrating shortcoming is that you must get the answers in the right order , since it reveals them in order , or you lose . no steals , no strikes . sadly , i ca n't return it since its a dvd game
1	the big bubbler is the greatest bubble wand -- -- we have had consistently huge bubbles with the top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution , as well as , the cheapest $ 1.99 jugs . the only thing that did n't work at all for us was straight dish detergent ( hey , we were desperate ) . my youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly , and even a neighbor 's preteen son could n't resist chasing the large bubbles across our yard . i also like that i am playing with the kids when i make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a battery-operated machine and then standing back . if i had to gripe , it would only be to say that i wish the top of the wand ( the end that holds the bubble solution ) could be stood on end . it is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling while waving the wand ; it is also tough for them to get the wand back into the top to get more bubble solution . we also go through a lot of solution -- -i plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have it on hand . but , this seems like a minor inconvenience given how much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our yard
1	many people are not time oriented . i have used this both in the classroom and at home . it allows the children a visual clue to how much time has gone past . i tell them they have 30 minutes to complete something . i set green for 20 , yellow for 7 , and red for 3 . i do n't have to say anything else . this eliminates waiting time once they realize that at red they need to be picking up and getting ready for the next lesson
0	it 's a big nasty mess . as big of a mess and disappointment as floa
0	the tent is extremely flimsy , has no bottom to it and falls over all the time . it will not stand straight up . could have bought a better child 's tent at a cheaper price
0	wow , i have never seen anything like this . it 's worse than bad ; it is virtually unplayable from a technical perspective . at the very least , amazon should refuse to carry it
1	this is a veary fun baseball game , i first played it at my summer camp and it was so fun , i got it for myself ! ! ! ! !
1	my 22-month-old has loved this toy for almost a year . the shapes are attractively colored and very pleasing to hold , and the attached hammer never gets lost ! all in all , a very nice version of a timeless toy
0	battery is way overpriced . contact battery store near you ! i did and found this same exact battery type ( 2-6volt batteries ) for much less . while there they told me i could use a low amp 12v deep cycle battery instead . it did take some time wiring ( fused link is a must ) but is well worth it . lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp `` trickle charge '' with a `` amp selectable '' car battery charger . all told it cost me less than $ 60 for everything . it now longer just `` takes up space ''
0	horrible ... i was very excited to play this as i am a huge fan of the arcade game . of course , i was n't expecting the quality to be the greatest but i was hoping for something playable . track ball is stingy , graphics are atrocious and there is only one course to play . i have played better functioning , playable golf games 20 years ago on an pc . the idea was great but this just was n't made well . do n't waste your money on this
0	the game of course is great fun , but the 3-d is not worth the extra cost . the kids get distracted by the slides and ladders and do n't play the game . they fight over which direction the marble should move ( and of course marbles get lost easily ) . how to count the spaces is not obvious . i would just get the good old classic game if i had it to buy over again .
1	when i got this house i was very impressed.easy to put together.bigger than i thought it would be and it is very realistic looking.my daughter enjoys this doll house
0	i purchased two of these locks and thought that they were going to work great . what a big disappointment . they both continued to fall off within 10 minutes of installing them and they continued to fall off . i just returned them . still looking for something to work .
1	lost cities is a really fun game , and very addictive . i 've personally played over 200 matches already on the free online version available at http : //www.flexgames.com/ check it out and play against some really good players across the globe and get a feel for the game itself before buying . i 've had my name in the notification list for this game on amazon.com for some time now , so i 'll definitely be purchasing it right away
1	it 's cute , well packaged and easy ( but time consuming ) to put together . for the price it ca n't be beat . too bad there 's no photo . she 'll use it for a while and we 'll sell it online when we are done and probably get most of our money back
0	this dog looked so cute and fun in the commercials and it was the one of only two things my 4 year old really asked santa for . come christmas morning , today , i open it and put the batteries in and all it did was whine and we were petting the head and chest hard . after about 3 minutes i did get it to bark then another 3 minutes later i got the tail to wag but the leg would n't shake for another 3 minutes . 20 minutes of trying to get it to do any thing at all it finally licked but the tongue was not wet and i did put water in it so it should have been wet . then my daughter got mad because she could n't get it to lick again . the dog does n't even stand up like it appears to be doing on the box.. it just lays there . if you are buying this , be prepared to be paying for a highly priced stuffed animal because that is all it amounts to . i ca n't believe a manufacturer would put some thing like this out there so that kids can be disappointed on christmas morning ... this product should have just plainly been recalled
0	i tried this toy at it 's lowest volume , and it 's still lound enough to damage young eardrums . remember that this toy is much closer to their ears than yours .
0	okay , the concept of this game cube is great , and believe me : you will spend many hours trying to solve this puzzle . now on to the reality ... i first tried this brain buster in the eighties when it came out . upon its first release , the stickers stayed on , the plastic squares did n't break off , and it just seemed like a higher quality piece . i beleive the plastic might have been heavier . but now , twenty years later , the stickers peal off , the squares pop out . junk , junk , junk ! if this was made in the usa it would now cost more than it does being manufactured over seas , however ... it would n't be junk . you get what you pay for . stephen john beccia author of the treelanders
1	this concept is very interesting and new fangled ( at least to me ) as far as plush animals . the interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a lot of fun for kiddos . i got this for my nephew and he likes it . it keeps him entertained . one thing -- they just do n't make stuffed animals the way they used to as far as quality . justin is not rough with his toys , and this hippo has already lost some of his hair . i wish we could find good quality plush anymore . i hate the idea of disposable toys because i grew up with tonka toys and teddybears that i still have . i still have my raggedy ann and andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago , and they have never lost hair . so buy the hippo for fun , but do n't expect him to survive
1	not only will this be a fun gift for our 5 year old grandson , it will be a fun gift for our 65 year old brother-in-law ! quite realistic looking ! it works great on smooth surfaces , but does n't do well on carpet . our dogs got a big kick out of it
1	santa claus brought this game for my daughter for christmas and she loves it ! it does n't take terribly long to play , so it 's a great game to hold the attention of a nearly 5-year-old . we 've even talked dad and big brother into playing , and there 's a ( playful ) fight over who has the crown . the perfect gift for little girls . thank you , santa
0	i brought this because my kids love spongebob ice cream..perfect toy , right ? wrong ! the ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob 's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone . we have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then i have a huge mess left in the kitchen .
0	if you are a picky mom like me ... i.e you do not let your child watch `` sponge bob '' or `` scooby doo '' and you maybe even read mothering magazine , do not get this book . i did n't feel the jokes were appropriate , i guess i am a bit of a nerd about these things . it is n't funny to have a headless man poor beer/ale down the `` hole '' in his neck . they discussed murdering shrek ( hey leap pad , not age appropriate ! ! ! ! ) , and i did n't like to see `` human '' shrek in chains fighting to get free ( nor did my son ) . they have `` ugly '' phrases that could have been more kid friendly , my son pointed out the ugly phrases , and snarled his nose at them saying `` mom , that was ugly ! '' . i was dissappointed with this book , and i am taking mine back to the store . i really like the leap frog system , even though i do n't normally buy toys that require batteries ... i.e the toys do something for the kid , instead i normally buy `` old fashioned '' natural toys where my son has to make the toys do stuff ( blocks , leggos etc ) but i really love this system . it is a treat for my son to have an electronic toy so he really gets into playing it and of course `` accidently '' learning . i also did n't like the hop on pop leap book for similar reasons , even though the dr. suess part was great , the leap pad people added unneeded `` ugly '' phrases again that were just not age appropriate . although i did like the minimal writing on most of the dr. suess pages . i do like the regular `` leap '' ones ... moss lake etc , and the honey pot one with pooh bear . sorry to be so picky , if you are not picky you will probly like this book .
1	these weebles are bigger then the ones that come with the box sets
1	this toy is the coolest toy i 've ever used ! when i have slumber parties i always play music , and my friends always say that i have the coolest boombox . some of them are even thinking about buying one . i love listening to music on my brand new bratz lips boombox . and this year at my birthday slumber party , i 'm gon na play music all night . this toy is just so cool ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	both my 4 2 year olds love the wedgits , my 4 year old however really gets into it . she loves to try and make what the pictures tell her . i was surprised at how good she was it . it really holds her interest
1	my 3 year old son received this as a christmas gift last year and he loves it . he explores outside and collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck . must say the truck is durable , it stays out on the deck and the weather does n't effect it . we hose it down to clean it , no issues there . highly recommend
1	this backpack has plenty of room for the extra leappad books and cartridges we have . i love having them all together with even little compartments for the cartridges to be secure in .
0	on the shelf or on line , this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt . it took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging . my son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys . yeah , the shovel portion drags on the floor and will not lock into position above the rig . this truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand . i grew up with tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation . if your looking for a durable fun truck for your child , move on as this truck wont get the smile your looking for .
0	my sone received this as a gift and was very excited about it at first , but as another reviewer mentioned , it quickly becomes frustrating if you do n't follow the directions exactly . after a few minutes he gave up and moved on . i finally donated it to charity with my son 's blessing - and this is a kid who saves everything
0	i should have paid more attention to the reviews . he is top heavy . there 's also no way to store the extra parts like mr . potato head . but i love spongebob anyway and he 's now a part of my collection .
1	my little girl loves her , and she always has magenta with her when she 's watching blues clues . only thing is she is a beanie baby so she 's small .
0	i bought these from a local dollar store . i thought , `` wow , all these for one dollar ? '' big mistake . i love painting and am good at it , but this set ruins every paper , canvas , painting at all . the brush hairs fall out and get mixed with the paint . do not buy this product
0	we bought this toy and returned it as it is poorly designed . because it is tall and narrow , once a few blocks are in it , it is nearly impossible to get any of the shapes in the lowest holes as the space inside the building is filled with blocks already . this was a frustrating , not very fun toy for our then 12 month old son
1	i bought the harry potter magic puzzles for my nieces and i scored some major brownie points . they loved this at first because it was about their hero , harry potter , however , they play with it for hours on end . putting the puzzles together is fun in itself , but then there are the cool magic tricks and the very cool optical illusion using the spiral disk too . this is great for any kid interested in magic , as well jigsaw puzzles and harry ! a big thumbs up
1	every human should have one of these . ideally , every human should have one of these in every size and color available . it does n't get any better than etch-a-sketch . i have several of them in my office , and they 're wonderful for long meetings and work sessions
0	we were very unhappy with this toy . the speakers were distored and the music sounded awfu
0	i feel like an idiot , maybe i did n't have all the parts or something but i tried and my husband tried and my neice tried and my friend tried and my stepson tried and none of us could figure out how to get this thing together . since there were no instructions , that helped alot . there was a picture but the hoops that went over secured to nothing and fell on the kid , making it utterly useless . though there were little things that appeared to attach to something , they taunted us and we tried and tried to attach this here and that there and maybe that will work ... it was ridiculous . we have n't had the issue with any other baby thing ... not car seats , not the red wagon , not the baby gates , not the crib or the cradle ... but this thing after several attempts we just took the hangdowns off and she played with those until the batteries died . we sold it at a garage sale for a buck and felt like glad for it to be out of our lives and out of our closet
0	my kids were getting very frustrated with the connections of masts and hulls . they are very poorly designed and `` pressure '' fit to a point where they easily pop off . both boats - the royal dutchman and black pearl - have poor fitting . compared to lego , the ability for parts to connect and stay connected is extremely poor . i plan to write a letter to mega blocks about this quality issue
1	the game is fun to play even if you 're not a nascar fan ! love it
0	i was excited about this pool because it seemed really easy to store when not in use . however , the new type of valve does not hold in the air . it says to push it all the way in but the valve on the one i bought would not stay in and when i tried to close the valve the presure from the air inside pushed open the valve and it deflated . it would have been perfect had the valve worked properly .
1	after three years of dragons who walk on all fours , we get a dragon who stands upright . seems kind of strange . thoron 's debut appearance was in the `` fire ice '' portal of fire set . he makes another appearance here in the metal ages , and he looks a lot meaner here . perhaps the rigors of battle are wearing on him . i bought stendhal first and was very pleased with him . i found thoron to be somewhat disappointing . he 's got some great detail , but he 's not as articulated as stendhal is . replacing the standard light-up feature is a dragon roar feature . thoron does n't light up , but he has a variety of growls and roars that are activated by a button on his chest . his articulation is pretty decent . his hind legs ( which he stands on ) are stiff and can only move back and forth . but it gets much better when we examine his arms and head . his arms can move back and forth , and away from his body . the shoulder joint can move in two directions . we get two additional points of articulation at the elbows and wrists . thoron 's wrists are n't as versatile as stendhal 's are ( stendhal 's wrists can turn in addition to the claw moving back and forth ) . his neck can move left and right , and his head can move in all manner of directions . as always , his jaw opens . his tail is flexible for super-posability , as are his towering wings . he can also turn at the waist . my complaints with thoron 's articulation are twofold . it would 've been nicer if his hind legs were posable , and it definitely would 've been nice if his wrists were articulated like stendhal 's are . thoron is mostly dark green with white highlights on his wings , white claws on his feet , and silver colored armor . as mentioned , the detail here is better than ever , and everything has a realistic look . he comes with a removable piece of armor for his head . i think he looks better without it , but maybe that 's just me . thoron is one of the most charismatic dragons i 've seen ( it 's all in the face and eyes ) . he looks kind of mean and vicious . stendhal is supposed to be the bad guy , and he does n't look this mean . the original thoron from the fire ice series has a better facial expression . this action figure comes almost completely assembled . i just had to attach his wings . also included are some parts for building a small tower with decorative blades and flag , and a draigar warrior with shield and weapon . all things considered , thoron is n't quite as nice as stendhal is . nevertheless , he gets a thumbs up from me . he 's a good addition to any dragons collection and a fun action figure to play around with
1	this little motorcycle is cute . however , it 's very lightweight and is similar in quality to a ride-on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount retailer . the stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date , none have peeled off . the extreme shipping price added another $ 10 to the $ 19.99 price tag . this is definately not a $ 30 toy .
0	i though this shark would be bigger . i bought the same one at a gift shop in ri for 99 cents 2 years ago
1	my [ ... ] really likes this train puzzle . he knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it . it goes straight across and is over 10 feet long . there is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter . he will say `` q quail '' or `` n nut '' when he is putting the piece on . the pieces are easy to attach , thick and very sturdy . the pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off . this would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old . the box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in .
0	`` jack '' does n't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it . do n't waste your money
0	my daughter had her tamagotchi v4 for about a day when the screen did n't work anymore . at first we thought it was the batteries but once we changed them i knew that was n't the problem . it would beep and make noise but you could n't see anything in the screen
1	even better than scrabble , you build words on the board and build words `` up '' by adding letters over existing words . so `` tree '' becomes `` free '' and `` braces '' becomes `` blades '' . the scoring might be a little too easy , but if you 're hard core , you can use the point values from scrabble to raise the score difficulty . the board is small so you have to start thinking up instead of out fairly soon into the game , and the game does n't drag on for too long . it is addictive and you will not look at words the same way again .
1	i ca n't say how great this toy is i mean it 's tall and the word he says is sweet pick it up today dont waste any time ... .. or and dont fall alsleep . it 's just great in every way that 's all i have to say i mean if you dont pick it up you for sure will be sorry ... i hope this helped any one who was thanking about getting i
0	this is not the usual quality that playhut stands for . the tent is held up by one plastic-corded pole that wo n't keep the tent upright . my daughter gets trapped in it as it collapses . the slumber bag is pretty , but the tent/tunnel is useless
1	it says some silly things which might not make us laugh . but overall a cute toy and kids will like i
0	some of these reviews are amazing , seems rather professional to me in most cases . these are just brine shrimp people , feeder shrimp for most fish . you want to learn how to keep a pet buy one , you want to learn how to grow food for it to feed off of then this is the starter kit . it 's not a pet it 's a food .
0	we bought this dollhouse , because when we went to the store , it had an adorable display and looked like a step up from the twintime dollhouse , which has very small rooms . you could press the button on the display , and the people would talk to each other . my kids thought it would be great . when we were at toys r us , i looked for accessory furniture/people/animal sets to go along with this dollhouse . i did not see any . i thought it was probably due to christmas just having passed . we got home , opened the dollhouse and discovered that there really were not many phrases that the provided people/furnitureanimal did , so i went to amazon to try to find more sets in order to achieve the purpose of this dollhouse ( to get the 200 phrases ) . thats when reality set in that we had just made a huge mistake . you can not find any accesory pieces for this set . you can go on ebay and pay many times more than the original price for used furniture . i was really disappointed . i even tried the fisher price website , only to find that they are marketing the twintime dollhouse furniture for this sweet sounds dollhouse . what a shame and a sham ... . i really like fisher price toys and we have many , but i am very disappointed in the fact that they are trying to fool the consumer . what good is a dollhouse , if you can not get it to accomplish what it says it will do -- -200 phrases . not to mention , what is included with the sweet sounds dollhouse is not much . just a mom , dad , girl , baby , swing , cradle , radio , cat , and a scant few more pieces . definately not enough to keep the kids interested for long ! there are actually three fisher price dollhouses that are still available , this one , the twintime dollhouse , and the one we eventually ended up buying at value city ( also available on ebay ) -- the fisher price special edition townhouse . it has a doorbell that rings , doors that open , birds that sing , phone that rings , lights that come on , fridge light comes on , computer lights up ( and is part of a desk set attached to the dollhouse ) , and a fireplace that crackles and lights up ( which is also attached to the dollhouse ) . these things are all on the dollhouse itself . no accesory furniture or people are needed to make this happen . the battery replacement compartment is on the back on this dollhouse not the bottom , like the sweet sounds one . the front of the townhouse has flower boxes with likelike flowers you place in them ( comes with the set ) . you can get it a lot cheaper than the sweet sounds dollhouse , too ( almost half the cost ) . it comes with a great deal of furniture : 2 beds with pillows and comforters and blankets , a lawnchair , 3 people , potted plant , real curtains , kitchen table and chairs , clothing for the people , computer chair , lounge chair and more . the kitchen counter , stove , microwave and fridge are part of the dollhouse . it also has closet doors that open and stairs the people can walk up . you practically do not need to buy anything else , but if you do , you can get the loving family accesory people and furniture sets . this dollhouse is so much larger to boot . there is plenty of room to put everything . it shuts and closes together just like the sweet sounds , but it is clearly larger . we also thought about the twintime , but it had too many comments on how small the rooms were and the display at toys r us looked jammed packed . i did not know how more than one child could play with it and not have a shoving match , because they could not play , as well . my kids absolutely the townhouse with all of its sounds , especially the doorbell . the great thing about it is that these are greatly reduced in price , because they are an older model , which is what they should do with the sweet sounds dollhouse . let the public know ahead of time , so their kids do not get disappointed , because it does not live up to what it says at the store . thank goodness i was able to take mine back , because i had my receipt and box . be careful and keep the box and receipt if you do choose to buy this dollhouse even after all of the warnings , because after your kids see that it does not do what it says and because it is on the small side compared with the townhouse version , they may not want to keep it . when we took ours back , a toys r us worker stopped and talked to us and agreed that fisher price is just trying to get rid of their extra stock of sweet sounds dollhouses . unfortunately , it is at the consumers expense and disappointment ! !
0	this is a wonderful toy . i have given it as a gift many times . but- this toy did not quack ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the child was very disappointed . ( so were the rest of us . ) it was returned . the experience was very bad
1	my daughter purchased this with christmas money and it did not work at all . we reported this to amazon and they took care of immediately . i was very impressed ! now we have a new toy that she loves that works great . it is fun to play with and a storage container when she 's finished .
1	my 6 year old loves this . yes it is small but who wants a big toy around the house this can go right on a shelf when not being played with i would get it again if i did not already have it
1	i was skeptical at first and i am so happy that i got this for my kids . i homeschool my children and needed something to keep one of the kids busy while i was working with another . this is easy to use , fun to play and i like the stories that are available . i think you get a great product for a great price
1	i agree that the denver reviwer is totally out to lunch . this doll greatly resembles my daughter 's friend jenny liu . jeeny was born in taiwan . chinese people do n't look any one way and to expect them to is racist , like saying they all look alike . the hair ornaments are plastic but they do look good . the dress looks redder when you display her out of the box.fabric quality is better than average for mattel . her hair is also much nicer and has more style than mattel had been giving us . i think this doll bodes well for better things to come in this doll series .
0	this product is awful , it wo n't stay together and is very frustrating to both myself and my three year old . what a disappointment .
1	my friends and i , all in college , are major movie buffs , so when another friend told me about the game , i was eager to try it . some parts are tough , but with the team setup of the game , it seems to even out . favourite rounds were still crazy : a round where scenes are built piece by piece , a word association round : 6 clues are provided and the idea is to name the movie , and the quotes round , of course ! the hardest rounds were the matching and the trivia rounds . still , we had great fun . its better if the teams are evenly matched , then its more fun . the main objection i have is that in the 8 rounds , many of the movies are dated and overused . there are great ones , though ... rain man , cast away ! ! also , this game is linear in progression , there is no variation in the order of the questions . scoring uses the honour system . there are 3 games , each lasting around 45 minutes at the very fastest , its the same as the cost of a regular dvd and is much more fun with lots of people . i have bought this for several people and some of my friends have as well . recently i played a game where a 12 year old and an 82 year old were playing so do n't worry about the age thing , both enjoyed it . really , i recommend it
1	any game that gets my husband dressed up in a tiara and earrings while playing a board game with his girls , is a great game ! it 's simple to play for anyone over age 3 ( unless the child is orally fixated- there are smaller pieces , so use your better judgment ! ) , is fast enough to hold a child 's ( and adult 's ! ) interest , and let 's everyone relax and not worry about rules- we really enjoy it and are wearing it out pretty quickly . it has been a great gift for other friends as well as it 's not too well-known .
0	my daughter is almost 6 and we got her this for christmas . the commercials made it look really cool and easy for kids , no more scissors ! well we opened it today and it 's too hard for her to hold the button down for any amount of time and to move it around slowly enough to actually cut anything . i 'm having to do it all for her and my hand gets tired too ! they should have made it that the `` pen '' cuts when just being pushed on the paper or something . i have a 9 year old also that was trying to use it and it was n't all that easy for him either . seems more like something teens or adults that scrapbook would use
0	we purchased this for our daughter after she loved the original ballet version so much . i expected the same quality of the original product and was very disappointed . the mat is very cheap and flimsy and my daughter broke the headset trying to get it on her head
0	the pixar cars characters from mattel can be purchased from target , walmart or toys r us for around $ 3.50 . do n't be taken in by these rip-off merchants . these are not in short supply and can be found with patience
1	i was disappointed when i opened the box and set up the tent because it was much smaller than i expected it to be . my friend 's daughter has an almost identical tent which is much bigger . apparently there are two different kinds , one made by playhut and one made by the disney store
1	this is a game that will help you practice , while you are having fun , to ask the right questions , to zero in on the answer and at the same time keeping tab of the progress . i believe it is the right questions that you ask that help you succeed in a game or in life.this is a game with a educational value that will enhance your creative thinking with a dose of fun.if you liked pictionary you will love questionary .
1	pixter is a fantastic learning tool for ages 3+ . as a parent , i love that many of the learning activities are based around drawing and creating so the child is not only gaining knowledge but also creating art at the same time . my son who will be 2 in a few weeks has a pixter , and though he is far below the age recommendation , he absolutely adores drawing with his pixter . he is very gentle with it and it can keep him entertained for hours . compared to the leapfrog leapster , pixter has many more creativity-based activities and leapster tends to be more of an arcade-style system . however , the leapster cartridges are much easier to find and there is a bigger selection of titles . i plan to purchase the leapster for my son for his 3rd birthday because the l-max can play games on the tv as well as on the handheld . also , contrary to popular belief , the pixter is not being discontinued as of this writing . i spoke with a representative at fisher price myself and she said that they are redesigning the system with new colors but not discontinuing it or any of the software . beware when purchasing these games on ebay for ridiculous prices from people claiming they are discontinued . wait for the stores to restock after the holidays and it will be a different story
1	the instructions could of been better on the hooks and the net but you could figure it out . you had to take the target out that they gave you because if you hit it it would slow the ball down . then you just put ribbon on the outline of the other target . otherwise i it is holding up great so far !
1	my 3 yo loves this - got it with a beautiful kitchen and she goes to town . it 's east to use and she retends to make sandwichs and cut the fruit and veggies - very cute
1	i love this toy ! i 'm 12 years old and i still love to play barbie 's ! i would reccomend this toy to any mother who has a little girl or boy that loves to play barbie 's
1	i went online to look for other little tikes toys with the handle and saw that this truck - which my 17-month old son loves - only had two stars and i wondered why . i disagree with most of the other reviews . the handle on top makes it easy for him to push around and carry - he can run it up slopes , on the ground , anywhere . he has never fallen or injured himself on it . in fact his frustration occurs because he can only pull the dump truck end up about 50 % of the time . usually he just hands it to me , and points that he wants it open . i do agree that the handle does make it difficult to put large items in the back and that the opening at the end of the dump truck makes it difficult for items to fall out . this is the only reason i 'm not giving this toy five stars . but my son loves this truck and has pretty much been playing with it constantly since we got it about a month ago . i 'm planning to get him the train with the handle because he likes this toy so much .
0	despite reading bad reviews , i took a chance and purchased this item . i got the first one , hooked it up and it quit working within two hours . ordered a second , it quits working within the hour . i should have known better as others have posted the same experience . great concept , maybe they will get the actual product correct in the next year . please do n't waste your time on this one now ... .
1	took my daughter roller skating and i like how they have 3 levels to choose from this really helped her
0	it has know fun . no education . and is a wayst of time
0	we were really excited about this item , but have been very disappointed . we followed the directions exactly , even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks ( which was frustrating and a pain in the neck ) -- and still we have nothing growing -- after weeks and weeks of waiting ! rotten thing to do to a kid ! the plastic dome is of decent quality , and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller -- worked out much better . this is a total waste of time and money , unfortunately
0	this is not quite what i was expecting - i thought the mat was at least electronic or something to provide feedback , however it 's just a plain cheap filmsy plastic mat that really adds nothing to the whole cheerleading experience . also , the video really moves too fast for my 4 yr old daughter and just up frustrating her . it might work okay for older kids , but it 's not very good for the younger ones
1	fly through spanish is some of the best software for the fly pen available . you can write a word in english and hear the spanish translation , or write a spanish word and hear the english translation . the translator will also spell out translations for you ( my only complaint is that the translations are spelled a bit too quickly , especially if you 're trying to write them down ) . the cartridge even comes with some games to help you learn spanish words . fly through spanish also comes with a booklet that has verb conjugation charts and ideas for games you can play . i was very impressed with the verb charts . they actually includes all the tenses and a chart of irregular verbs . fly through spanish is a great tool for learning and practicing spanish words . please keep in mind that this software will not teach you spanish but it is a wondeful and downright fun addition to a class or self-study program . i hope that leapfrog releases more languages , especially french
1	i was very happy with the product i purchased and i received it in a timely fashion . the product was not worn nor used . it was as if i bought it at the store at a lower cost . it was a win/win for me . thank you
1	this is my favorite game of all time . this is the kind of game my family and i love to play at our beach house every morning . it 's a great family game . really for no one over mabye seven . i recomend this to any family who loves a great game to play with the whole family
1	i have read other reviews here that this table is too high for 2 and 3 year olds . maybe so but , it is wonderful for 4-5 year olds ! those `` in between stages '' kids who want to have a small table of their own but , need something a bit taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers . my son ( almost 5 ) and his big sister ( 7 ) can both sit together and eat a snack at this table . it is very sturdy ! the small drawer is great for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time . the surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative play with puzzles or action figures . the unique oval shape of the table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table top surface space . my son had outgrown 2 `` child size '' table and chair sets by age 4- most are actually buit for toddlers- this table is actually for `` kids '' and it has been a big hit at our home . guess who 's getting the matching lifestyle kitchen for christmas
0	this item was not at all what is seems to be . the box was the only durable part of the toy . i unfortuantely purchased 3 of these as christmas gifts for 3 different boys ages 5 6 years old . after seeing them open and what was in the box , i was very disappointed
0	radica used to amke good hand held electronic games ; this was is cheap . buttons need to be pressed unusually hard to respond . dark screen that lights up only when the room is nearly pitch black
1	my 2 year old daughter loves these dolls and i like them because you ca n't remove their clothes or shoes ! very cute and durable dolls
0	this lite-brite is a piece of junk ! do n't wast your money ! maybe if i were n't comparing it to the older one i would think it was ok but even then i am not sure . i loved my lite-brite as a kid and wanted to get my daughter one so she could have as much fun as i did with mine.this has not left the box since the first day . first all of the screens where you stick the pegs are white not black like the old one so without the refill sheets it is useless.also without the refill sheets the pegs are too big and they do not stay in.this was very frustrating ! even with the sheets sometimes they still fall out ! i am really unhappy with this purchase and i can usually find something about a toy i like but not this one . i just did n't want anyone to be deceived into thinking that the screens were black and you could make your own `` art ''
1	i hate spiders ( yes i admitt that i make my wife kill them ) and so does miss muffet ... or is she . as her outfit might suggest , looks like miss muffet as a bit of a fetish going on , need i say s , and with that said , being pinned ( blindly i might add ) by this monsterous spider may be more of a turn on then you might think . you 'd expect to see miss muffet in a frilly dress and bonnet maybe , blue dress to be exact but with her lether bondage in black and pink this 'twisted ' point of view proves to be anything but expected . i say kudos to you mcfarlane for truly reimagining the fairy tale ( nursury rhyme , whatever ) and giving us yet another piece of art
0	i bought this doll for my daughter for christmas and she was so excited , however in the last three days i have found that this doll was not worth the price . the paint on the lips has already worn off , the eye lashes are falling out and it is difficult to keep the face clean , no matter how many times a day we wash it . it has also stopped drinking when the bottle is placed into it 's mouth . i know of several other girls that are friends of my daughter who are having the same diffculties as we are . if my daughter did n't love this doll some much i would return it for something worth it . i guess if you are just intrested in making your child happy this is a good product however for the money i would suggest something else .
1	my nephew who is 3 years old got my first leappad not to long ago and he loves it . he loves train so he got one that is thomas the train and he playes it the morning when he get up and at night before he goes to sleep . there are many different types , and they are everywhere you just have to know where to look . for instance [ ... ] over all i think this is an amazing learning toy for toddler and young kids who look forward to reading and writting .
0	we went through the process of cleaning the tank and sterilizing the water , adding the package of sea monkeys , and finally feeding the sea monkeys and nothing happened . ( ... ) . hope these are not dead
1	my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors , i like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen ! it has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile . it was a little difficult at first , for my son to handle , since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast . the colors are pretty cool , the faster it spins the more colors come out ( primary + yellow/orange colors ) . i like that it holds his interest . a [ ... ] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow !
0	these are great little toys , and my three year old is obsessed with them ! he 's getting most of them for christmas , but we 've already bought him a few . they 're die cast , so they are a good weight , but note that some of them have plastic pieces as well . even though i like these toys , i 'm only giving them two stars . this is a horrible price ! ! i honestly bought sally today at my local k-mart , and it was on sale for $ 2.89 ( normally $ 3.19 ) . now i know when items are scarce and in high demand their price goes up , but this is a crazy markup . i understand that this is a third party seller , but amazon should note with their sellers that there is a difference between mark up for high demand toys and rip offs . i have purchased chick hicks ( $ 9.50 ) and lizzie ( $ 5.00 ) off of ebay , but i 've been able to find the rest of the cars at my local targets , wal-marts , k-marts , etc . it takes time and searching , but it beats paying these prices
0	just what the world needs , another clone of the worst board game ever to sell like hotcakes . i can not think of any reason to recommend this game . the winner is determined by luck , there is no skill involved in winning this or any game of monopoly . the game hardly fits into a single evening of play , and for a few unlucky players who exit early that means either sitting around watching or finding something else to do ( this may be a blessing if it means not playing anymore ) . so to anyone who is buying this to play it ( not because you are a huge dog fan and must own everything that has a dog on it ) i recommend that you look into a better product . i would start by going to google and searching on `` board game '' . follow the 1st link you find
1	these dogs are adorable and are a cute addition to the dollhouse set . my daughter sends the other pets outside to play with this set . plays with them as much as the people . great addition
0	this game was put together with a nice concept , be a ctu agent and help jack bauer stop the terrorist attack . also , i liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game . however , the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well . though you try to do what it tells you to do , it does n't seem to work . since these interactive parts are so simple , yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on , you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end . i had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly . so , if some bugs were worked out , this game could be a much bigger success
0	this sorter is very light duty . it jams frequently and unless the coin tubes are perfectly round , the coins do not enter them squarely . i can not recommend this coin sorter . i am looking for a better quality sorter ...
0	i could n't agree more about this product . it 's appalling how badly made it is . the concept is very cute - a toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small die-cast vehicles . my 2.5 year-old has a hard enough time dealing with frustration without this toy adding to it ! the bridge on the right does n't properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do not attach properly . it 's also a battle to get the tool box to connect together . my son always wants to play with it , but i ca n't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart . i think this toy will have to mysteriously `` disappear '' one night while he is sleeping . they should withdraw this rubbish from the market and refund us all our money !
0	my son received this figure for his birthday - it broke within the first 5 minutes . the sign on his chest lights up , which is cool - but now he has no legs , so he certainly ca n't run
1	the remote on this car has nice big buttons that are easy for my two year old to use . one button makes the car go forward and one turns it around . the third just makes reving engine squealing tire sounds . not very realistic but convincing enough for a toddler . this car has been tossed around and dropped yet still looks and works great . it is a very durable toy that is simple to use . it is a great first remote control car .
1	i liked the pool for this very hot summer that we have had ; i would recommend a cover for it
0	i was dissapointed in the quality of this microphone . the sound effects are very loud and `` crumbly '' and the microphone itself is a bit cheap . the microphone does not amplify the voice very loud either . cute to look at though
1	we saw this online and really wanted it , but decided to wait because of the reviews . well today we went to an outlet store that sells new stuff at huge discount prices , and it was only 10.00 my son has already ridden the heck out of it with no problems , and he loves it . we havent had to replace a fuse and it just the right size for my 1 and a half year old . its a really great little bike , but for the workmanship of it , i definitly wouldnt pay 50 dollars for it , maybe 30-35 most . we just got blessed with a really great deal : ) so if ya want this for your kids , its great for the smaller rider , and just the right speed for him to control . hope this helps someone :
0	i have the same review as the rest . thankfully , we checked it out after we bought it and were able to return it for another model before christmas . the remote control lightning mcqueen with the regular controls ( one lever for forward and back , another lever for right and left ) was an excellent alternative . i would recommend it for any child over about 3 1/2 .
0	for $ 50 , the scanner needs to work consistently . we were able to get the orange juice to scan 3 times although we 've attempted to scan every item probably a dozen times each . not only can a 4 year old not get it to scan but no adult that has tried can get it to scan . i ca n't return this item quick enough . without the working scanner , i would be just as happy with the $ 8 generic shopping cart that tru sells .
1	the game is good for all ages . the train sounds are really great for kids . it is fun for a holiday or any kind of group gathering
0	we baught a bunch of these fish for our 8 year old.we have a inground pool and thought they would be lots of fun ! ! okay we took them out of the package , and had to rearrange the batteries 82 times before it would even respond to the water ! ! ! when we placed it in the pool all it did was go on its side , in circles . nothing was `` realistic '' about these things ! ! ! ! i should add that it was not just this one , but all of them ! ! ! do not waste your money or time buying these ! !
1	after we saw the monster 's inc. movie , my daughter bedded for a book ! it was wonderful when we found out that leapfrog had developed a book for the leappad . my daughter has spend hours playing with this book , and playing the games in the book . it is her favorite leapfrog book
0	the first time my husband installed this toilet lock it stayed put for about 3 days . i thought it came loose because he did n't wipe the toilet before attaching it . i wiped the lock and toilet with rubbing alcohol and assumed the problem would be fixed . the lock fell off later that same day . now the dumb thing wo n't even stay on for 15 minutes and when i do get it attached my 13 mo . old can pull it right off
1	i 've bought this toy for my daugther ( she 's 6 ) and she loves it , it 's a good toy to use alone , to share with friends or even with her parents ( myself ) . it 's a good option to the computer , she also carries this toy with her stuff when she goes outside
1	since i had always wanted a `` mad scientist '' lab when i was a girl and never got one , my husband purchased this for my 4 1/2 yr old son and i to do together . overall , it 's been fun . everything but water has been included which is a plus . the `` lab '' comes with interlocking pieces which can be assembled in a variety of ways . i like this component because it helps children with problem solving , creativity and motor skills . the kit also comes with recipie cards and its own measuring spoon and beaker . it 's really taught my son to learn how to measure . however , the recipie cards tend to generalize and direct you to refer to other recipie cards , which my son would not be able to figure out without my help . the steps on the cards come with both words and pictures which was a plus but they omitted some details that probably only a grown up would catch . on the other hand , the `` experiments '' or recipies go from simple gelatin molds of bugs to more complicated creatures that progressively build upon previous experiments . they also encourage creativity by giving further suggestions for mixing colors , flavors . i was also pleasantly surprised at how well the `` experiments '' actually tasted for a toy kit . on the other hand , if made as directed we found it difficult to actually fill the monster molds with the amounts directed on the `` recipie '' cards . overall , this was a great gift because it got my son and i to spend some fun time together
1	i was so glad when my little sister got this game for her birthday ! unfortunaty our version was n't like the version i had when i was young . for some reason the people stand did n't open or close very well . so while for some you could smack down , others you had to jiggle and wiggle to get to lay flat . not only that but when we would start a new game , you 're soppose to be able to just flip the board over and all the stands would flip out . well for the red board they did n't flip so well , in fact only a few would flip up with out help . that could have been my fault when i put the pieces together . the game was still fun , althought it was hard teaching my six year old sister not to exclaim out loud that she 's glad of who she got because she likes her hat . although i did n't have a problem with her picking her person instead of doing it randomly , ( like you 're soppose too ) i still love this game and forever will .
0	our daughter became this as she was a baby . we tried several time during her past 2 years if she would reach a moment to like it , but she always wanted to go out after 1 or 2 minutes . maybe other babies are diferent , but i think its not the right material for such a playground . for a hot environment like ours in the south , it quickly gets very hot inside and you can not leave your baby or little child alone playing because of the plastic material that can be dangerous . we finally sealed the holes on the bottom and do not pump up the upper part so we fill it with water and use it as a litle pool , thats the only way for us to use it
1	i found this hamper storage bin to be great the kids can see into the bins and the bins do n't add weight to the unit so the kids can carry the bins easily to pick up toys . however the bins could be a little bigger because they tend to fall off the holding rods if you bump the unit . the hamper is great because my 3 year old son can fill up his hamper but he ca n't tip it over and spill dirty clothes on the floor but it is light weight and easy for him to help haul to the laundry if he wants to . good ite
1	it seems that just about every house in our subdivision has an electric ride-on toy . there are few `` barbie '' jeeps , few polaris atvs , one corvette and three gators and few others . my 4 year old daughter was the first gator owner . i must say , it is expensive.. this thing is by far the most expensive toy my daughter has , bar none . should you buy your 4 year old $ 300 ride-on toy ? well ... that 's up to you . but she loves her gator . she had to give up on lot of other toys to get this one , but she is extremely happy with it . sometimes i wish i was 40lbs so i can ride this thing . she ca n't care less about the `` barbie '' thing , so this green utility machine was fine with her . the gator is slightly faster than others and the fat tires and truck bed makes the gator looks a lot more serious than the barbie jeep . the truck bed is really useful . although not recommended , she hauled two kids on the bed . with 4 kids on the car , it still zoomed around the street quite well . one time i loaded nail gun , air compressor , electric drill and jigsaw and panel saw all on the bed and asked my daughter to drive to the other side of the yard to fix the fence . i saw our neighbor hauling few bags of mulch on theirs . it made such a funnt scene.. little electric toys carrying real tools and stuff . very cute . enough of fun stuff . problem 1 . battery location and the hassle to recharge this thing . you have to open the front grill and sometimes the latch can pinch your finger . it hurts . problem 2 . the left front wheel fell off while my daughter was driving it . i tightened it again and never happened . problem 3 . slipping tires . people complain about the tires having very low friction . they slip very easily on driveway and grass . but this is how it `` protects '' its gearbox so i do n't really care , but i heard they are expensive once they wear out . i think this is the best ride-on toy on the market today . if extra $ [ ... ] wo n't hurt you too much , then do consider the gator . your children will not be disappointed .
1	the 1st version of this game was a fun and exiting game for my family . but we soon got bored of the same video over and over . we could not believe it when we saw a new version of the game out , we rushed out to buy it and found this version not the same and not as complicated or as fun as the first they should have just released the first version of the game with new dvd setup it was a waste of money
0	we bought this item for our son 's birthday . we assembled it exactly as shown in the directions . the cars do not launch properly into the loop - we have yet to have one car make it through the entire track . also , when you place cars to `` launch '' and `` crash '' they shoot clear across the room . one knocked our daughter in the chest ! not worth what we spent on the item and we are finding ourselves increasingly dissappointed with hot wheels items .
0	i thought baby would be much more interested in this . it 's colorful and easy to grab -- but for some reason , it 's a non-starter
0	it 's a cute little set - and i mean little . wayyyyy over-priced . ( ... ) just did n't live up to expectations
0	another reviewer said that this was a soft doll with no hard parts . i ordered it thinking it would be perfect for my niece . what i got was a hard plastic doll with small pieces labeled `` not for children under three . '' needless to say , i was very disappointed . this would be great for a 4 or 5 year old , but do n't expect a soft , cuddly doll for your little one
0	the gates and fences are hard to set up and they fall back down easily . best for modeling not play
0	what a disappointment . the spinner just ca n't gain enough speed to do anything lilke what it is supposed to do . overall , it 's a cheap item with limited supplies for the $
0	what a waste of time to air this up . it developed leaks in less time to it took to enter the credit card info to order it . this was the worst gift because it had such a high expectation but turned into the biggest disappointment . the vinyl was so thin that rolling it over normal bermuda grass created holes from small seed pods and sticks . save your money..
1	this schleich haflinger is a good buy . schleich is as detailed as breyer , and are as big as breyer paddock pals . this haflinger stallion is a palomino , with a shaggy mane and tail . this horse is full of personality , and is well worth the money . your kid will love this model horse .
1	this was a great buy from amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping . my [ ... ] just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of melissa and doug products . we normally purchase them from tuesday morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper . this puzzle has made my toddler happy . he fits it together then dumps it , repeating the process several times a day . the drawing is realistic and there are no pegs , so it gives a little more grown up feel to the piece .
1	my nephew cooper put on his superman suit right away . he especially liked the suit is inflatible . good choice and excellent price
0	i am very disappointed with this product . the volume is not adjustable , and the default sound setting is so loud that it can be heard in another room , even with a door closed . electronic toy voices are occasionally annoying or difficult to understand , this is the case here . so , needing to have something repeated ... loudly ... can `` get on your nerves '' . i will be more careful in the future and not assume that all speaking electronic toys come with adjustable volume . buyers beware !
1	my 5 year old daughter got this monkey when she was little and has slept with it every night since . my 1 year old daughter loved her big sister 's monkey so we had to get her one of her own . she loves it and sleeps with her monkey every night now
1	the lego community workers set met our expectations and even more . the set comes with lots of different pieces and has made our lego experience very fun . albeit a little on the expensive side , this set is well worth it
0	i recently purchased the deluxe version of yahtzee after enjoying the regular game for many years . i was impressed with the gold dice and the dice cup . everyone else in the house not playing really loves the padded cup . i was disappointed in the dice tray . it is very flimsy and not properly designed . it should have a rotator and be made of more durable material . also , the score pads that came with the game do not have a place on the back to tally player totals . i felt ripped off when i discovered this obvious mistake
1	we wanted this little doll for our own `` little ariel '' . she is perfect for the bath tub ! she comes with her own float , wand with bath tints , and swim coverup ! ! her bright red hair is put in little pig tails with bows and she has a baby powder fresh scent ( which we were not expecting- my husband is not to found of that ) . we are very pleased and hope that this company continues to make baby princess items ! ! !
1	i just transformed it for the first time into a truck . it was challenging but doable . probably one of the coolest toys ever , but i was an 80 's child . as someone else mentioned , the grill in front does not quite align with the cab windows when it 's all set , but other than that it 's great . tremendous amount of detail ( moveable leg vents , head , mouth , individual fingers/thumb poseable , light behind matrix , datacom interface , working shocks on the wheels , and accessories ) . it 's quite tall and heavy for a toy- very impressive . if a piece snaps off from forcing it the wrong way , it is designed to snap back on . i never got to own a transformer as a teen but my lost childhood is now officially redeemed . this will adorn my office cube as a conversation piece
0	got a dud . lights flash ( constantly ) but not a peep out of it . has an email address , wrote for suggestions twice , also no response . but the mail was delivered so i can only assume they 're playing dead ( or playing with one that works ) ! big let down
1	theres a few things the are nice about this prime and things that arent pros : extrem detail coloring is good megatron rifle is sweet mouth moves cons : primes regular gun will barley fit in primes hands bit more platic then die cast a pain to transform pushing legs in most of all sound base sounds like a ultra magnus mixed with prime i can find more cons then pros i would only get this toy for some one 11 or older not somebody who goes all wild and takes there toys every where oh wait another pro ! : primes leg vents open when you stand him u
1	chaturanga is the oldest known form of chess . it dates back to india in the seventh century a.d. front porch classics has carefully re-created this game and it is now available to everyone ! the game itself is beautiful . it is played on a fabric playing board ( all games were once played on fabric , it 's extremely portable and cheap , and cardboard was n't even invented until the late 1800 's ! ) . unlike chess , the game can be played with two to four players . each player gets 8 playing pieces , made of clay : a raja , an elephant , a horse ( cavalry ) , a ship and four infantrymen . these pieces are kept in beautiful velvet bags . each piece does have a loose equivalent in modern chess . the raja is the most important piece , much like the king . the elephant acts much like the rook . the ship is the bishop , and you can not capture a raja with the ship . the cavalry moves exactly like a knight . the infantry , which in this game look kind of like tiny buddhas in lotus position , are like the pawns . the big difference between chaturanga and chess is that chaturanga is played with a four-sided die ( it 's a long rectangle , instead of a perfectly square cube ) . the die tells you which piece you have to move . the game is somewhat easier to learn than chess , but easily as much fun . the game can and should be used by teachers and parents to introduce their children to the history and culture of india . the rulebook includes lots of interesting information about india as well as about the history of the game . the game comes in a convenient bookshelf edition , where the game is kept in a beautiful book-shaped box that looks great on any bookshelf or coffee table
1	my daughter has been riding for about 3 years now and she was so excited to see this christmas morning . of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play . her grandma and i played and i was surprised at the amount of things i have learned just from taking her to her lessons ! i 'm sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions like trivial persuit but that was my only problem with the game . there is n't questions asked every move . but otherwise , it is an excellent game . i would definately recommend it
1	this is the best value i 've seen for a dinosaur set . my sons love it , and several of my friends have gotten it for their own children after they 've seen the kids playing with ours . the volcanoes , rocks and mat are a real plus , and the dinosaurs are big enough to be fun for the kids . they play with this set a lot
1	we all love this toy . what i like about it , is that it 's easy to use , even for my almost three yr old , it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious , it 's sturdy , ( will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard ) it looks good , not cheap , and it 's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes . this has been the big hit this christmas . even more so than tekno puppy
0	the nose is glued and sewn on , but my baby still managed to chew it off . i found it hanging by a thread from it 's face one day . so , cut off the nose before giving it to your baby , or never leave your baby alone with it once teething starts . too bad about the nose because my baby loves his puppytunes .
1	i purchased this pirate ship for my son 's fourth birthday . this is by far the most popular toy in our house ! my 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter also love this toy . there are so many items that come with the ship - from canon balls , swords , treasure chest full of goodies , food , animals and even jewelery for the pirates - they are never bored . my four year old plays on his own , or with his friends , and when all three are home they all play together . definitely worth the investment for the amount of joy this toy has brought to our home !
1	i run an afterschool program . this game is a big hit with the 3rd through 5th graders . they play it so much i bought an extra game in the tin . they ca n't get enough of it
0	it sucks it breaks easy and does n't work good dont waste your money like i di
0	want a sure fire way to kill your party ? ? put this dvd in , turn the music off , make people sit down and play this game . it was not fast , it was not frightening , it was not fun . your guests would have more fun watching the paint dry in your basement
1	i bought the bean bag toss as a christmas gift for my 22 month old son . he had played the bean bag toss the first time at the halloween carnival at the church . it was all he wanted to play that night . i wanted something that would be easy to pick up at the end of the day . at just three pieces , it is simple to put together and take apart . although it says it is for 5 and older , it would probably get old fast for a child that age
0	while the kids love it , it 's a headache for parents . it takes forever to inflate , even with an air compressor , thanks to many individual air chambers . as other reviewers noted , it 's best not to leave it outside ( the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage ) , but it 's far too big to leave up inside the house . not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down . i gave ours away
0	the wooden thomas the tank engine trains do not fit in this case . the case is way to small for the trains to fit in . i would not recommend anyone buying this item . it is just a brightly painted metal box , that doesnt serve any useful purpose . the manufactor should be ashamed for false advertising .
0	i do n't know who dark wolf is , but he must have shares in the company who makes these mini-rubber chickens . these are some of the ugliest , cheesiest and most poorly manufactured novely items i have ever seen . do yourself a favour . get something else
0	this love ball was very un-lovely . the messages would not appear clearly in the window , no matter how i tried turning it over different ways.maybe it sat too long in the wrong environment before i received it . i put it back in the box and plan to ship it back
1	i am very pleased with this play food . it is very realistic looking and a great size - not too big and not too small like some of the cheaper sets . definitely recommended and well worth the money
0	i bought this barbie after seeing two pictures of angel barbies on the website and reading the manufacturer 's description . one picture seems to have been deleted now . the manufacturer 's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash . i trusted that the manufacturer 's description , which matched one of the pictures , was the correct angel . the doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all . it is very simple with vinyl wings . be aware of which you are purchasing , the description is deceptive and incorrect
1	i 've been thrilled with the car so far . super fast , and super cheap at this price . it could be a little more responsive when turning , but otherwise great . lasted about 25mins with long fast runs using a generic 9.6v pack by newbright . as other person said , works better on packed surfaces vs loose dirt and grass . i bought it to bring back memories of my old tyco turbo hopper from childhood ... and it did a great job at that .
1	our 2-year-old loves thomas the train , so this was a great gift for her . she has other thomas items , but they 're limited to playtime . this , however , is not only good for playtime , but safe enough for her to take to bed with her ( she even kicked her elmo out to make room for thomas ! ) . it 's also small enough for her to be able to take on car rides . a great all around item to have if you 've got a child that 's really into thomas
1	everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic darth vader mask . we bought it initially for my son , who is darth vader obsessed , but it 's quickly become the house favorite . ( even grandpa ca n't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be darth for a spell . ) on another note : we keep this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a great conversation piece . it is so realistic looking and it makes a menacing piece of art on display
0	this was not fun at all boring and she only played with it one time definately a waste of mone
0	we gave this toy to our 4 year old son . that was 1 1/2 years ago . it worked at first , but the balls did not pop up high enough for him to hit . after about 1 month , the balls did not pop up at all . little tikes replaced it with a completely new toy . again , it worked for a few months , but now it does not work . the beeps sound ( a nice feature ) , but nothing happens . my son has given up on the automatic feature and will sometimes use it as a t-ball stand . most of the balls are lost . thank goodness i only paid $ 10 for this on sale - but not even worth that much
1	much smaller than i imagined it would be , but then again i am not very good with measurements . it is a very cute doll and my niece loved it
1	while nothing beats wood blocks ( in my opinon ) we had these first , and they are fun ! we like that they are flexible and easy for little hands to manipulate , and not painful if they fall on you ! the only downside is that they are large , and storing them in the bag is like putting together a puzzle-they just fit . storing them in a toy box fills the box with wasted space ; so we stack them in 4 rows beside the toy box . it 's worth the hassle if you have space for them and do n't mind stacking them up and teaching your little one to
0	when i bought this toy , i thought it was soooo cool . but it really does n't do anything it 's supposed to do ! it just makes annoying crying and whining noises that do not sound real . even if i tickle its tummy it just whines and cries . do not , i repeat , do not buy this toy ! ! ! !
0	product is average ... on ours the button whole is sewed so tight even i have problems buttoning ... impossible for my 20 month old . it says clothes remove fully and easily ... which i thought would be great for my daughter since she likes to try and dress things ... but the pullover has to be removed by pulling over the head and it is n't easy ... and again is almost impossible for a little one . also ... ours did n't come with a back pack which i 'm sure would have made the toy more fun ! perhaps she 'll gain interest and capability with the toy in months to come ... but right now ... she has about as much interest in it as she does in say ... carpet
0	i 'm not going to go into my childhood , or how i love the transformers or any of that stuff , i just wanted to give a quick review . as always , you get what you pay for . i bought this today and within five minutes of transforming it one of the joints popped out and i ca n't for the life of me get it to sit correctly back in the socket . bottom line is that it is very cool that ten dollars will get you a g1 inspired astrorain or starscream , but be aware these feel very flimsy and are definately better utilized sitting on your desk at work in robot mode than being transformed back and forth while you are bored watching tv . very cool , very flimsy , very inexpensive
0	i bought this item for my newborn - thinking it would grow with him and be useful for at least the 1st year . i was so wrong . first , as i feared , the water `` fishbowl '' leaked the 1st time i filled it . i returned it and the next one leaked as well . then , the mirror is one of those `` plastic '' mirrors that gives a distorted reflection - which was of no value or interest to my son . the cow that makes noise died after less than a month of light to no use . finally , the toy just did n't have that `` fun '' value that a $ 43 toy should have . he hated it - never attempted to crawl down it , never played with the features . save your money - this toy is of poor quality and poor entertainment value . there are tons of better products out there..
0	i `` played '' with this at a specialty toy store and was pretty disappointed with it . i thought i wanted this for my son after seeing it online but i 'm so glad we got to try it at a store first . my toddler showed almost no interest in it . it looked hard to use and not at all fun . however , it looked like it was well made of good wood and with good stains/paint and finishes . we 've had more fun with a plastic food container that i cut a square shape on the lid and my son fills it up with his wooden abc blocks . btw , you can do the same using matchbox cars , peek-a-blocks , etc . just use a different plastic food container ( yogurt , sour cream , powdered drinks , etc . ) for each shape .
1	i was very pleased when this toy finally arrived . the blue devil is removable and semi-posable ( his arms move ) . he is the same size as the simpson figures from the playmates line of toys , so i feel like he was made with collectors of those figures in mind . the homer donut-eating action does n't always work correctly -- the mouth and donuts are n't correctly synchronized , so sometimes the donuts miss his mouth -- but that does not detract from the fun
0	purchased this item for traveling . our son does n't travel well . so we purchased this item for him and it does n't strap on to the car seat like the picture shows . the straps are material and velcro on the ends . how do you attach these straps ? so , now we just let him play with it being free . it does n't attach
1	a lot of fun ! the kids really enjoy this updated version of their favorite game . product was shipped promptly !
0	besides being unstable , this truck is extremely frustrating ! my son is constantly trying to put items in the truck that are too big , and then if he does manage to get a `` load '' in , he ca n't get it back out again ! ! he has cried in frustration and thrown the toy across the room . i will be buying him a fisher price one for his birthday that actually dumps
0	i have checked out almost every card shuffler in the market . and i can tell you that apart from the one made by excalibur they are all the same , and cardinal is not an exception . so here is my review . this is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really , really hate . this thing does not shuffle plus it will eat up your cards badly . do not buy this piece of garbage ... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so . if you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase , here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new card shuffler . 1 . pet dog 's chew toy 2 . door stop 3 . play street hockey 4 . stress release stomping toy 5 . mother-in-law birthday gift 6 . modern art for coffee table 7 . nerf ball target practice 8 . condom dispenser kind of think about it , this is a great toy . have fun ! ps . if you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at excalibur professional 6 deck card shuffler ; you might like it .
1	this large version of michael myers is a lot beter than the mcfarlane version released ever how many years ago . first the pose is better.second no blood stains ! do n't get me wrong , michael myers is a movie killer , but he never got bloody ! that was my biggest complaint with the mcfarlane version . he does have slight oily looking stains on his coveralls , but if you remember from the movie , he killed a mechanic to get those coveralls . finally third , and pretty cool , the sound effect is diffrent . instead of laurie strode 's whiny help me , you get the halloween theme playing along with michael 's breathing . remeber the end of the first movie , after loomis shot him , but the body was missing , the closing shots were shown with the theme music accompanied by myers ' breathing . if you got the neca boxed set of michael myers and loomis and liked it , get this ! if you got the mcfarlane version , get this ! if you just like halloween , get this ! you wo n't be disappointed ! looks better in person than on the picture
0	i am an active 48 year old and i own a vurtego pro pogo stick . i ride motocross and i mountain bike regulary and i like the exercise and fun factor it offers . i chose the vurtego pro after doing some online research and i am totally pleased with the performance . the guys who designed and developed the vurtego pro and fit sticks were looking for a way to offer a more affordable model for beginers and people looking for a fun but still high quality stick . the power model came up short of their extpectations and they pulled thier endorsement due to quality and safety concerns . for the money the power pogo is a fairly decent pogo stick but its not going to stand up to the abuse and demands of an expert or extreme pogo stick rider . it takes allot of effort and experience to go 6 ' or higher on any pogo stick . i am pretty good at mine , after about a month of use i am getting up in the 3 ' range and bouncing 500 plus consecutive times in a session before taking a break and going for another session or two , a great workout ! i have pogo stick experience and can pull off most of the basic tricks , i consider myself a beginner to intermediate at the most . i doubt that i will ever reach the six foot level at my age , but that was never my goal . i know that the people at vurtego are still working to develope a model that will be safe and affordable for those looking for a capeable , high quality and durable stick . if your looking to go 6 ' and pull off serious stunts i would buy the orignal vurtego pro or the fit model for a great workout . if you are looking for a little less i would wait for the next version that the vurtego people will offer and endorse . i personally would avoid this one .
0	yes i 've just bought the videonow color fx and want more pvd 's but they are kinda costly so i want to know is ther a need to buy this item ? can you burn regular dvd 's to a pvd ? and is this going to be a wast of money ? is there any were to buy blank pvd '
0	my son is a thomas fanatic . this lunchbox did n't last one week without one of the legs snapping off , so it would n't stand up . then a few weeks later , he dropped it and the handle shattered . total waste of money . it 's a shame - it has a nice storage box in front , but the quality is below even what i 'd expect from a chinese sweatshop
0	i bought this item for my 6 year old niece . not only was i disapointed with how it physically looked ( colors were not bright like other cars toys ) , i was absolutely disgusted with the name calling in one of the sayings . i realized when it called the tractor a negative name , stupid i believe it was , that it was going back . i would n't want my child having a toy that calls others names , so i wont give it to anyone either . not to mention , the grammar used , is not correct . i realize that is the character , but why would i want to teach children grammer that is wrong ? all in all , disapointment , that disney puts out toys like this
1	no hiking dad would be complete without a kelty kid carrier . we have taken ours everywhere . from disneyworld to the redwoods . they distribute the weight to your hips making it much easier to carry a child where ever you want to go
1	my 6 year-old daughter got this for christmas and spent more than an hour coloring the pieces . the ink dries quickly and seems to stick pretty well . we have rinsed the tea set a couple of times and never noticed ink washing away .
1	these coins are nice and heavy ... they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the pouch . my son uses them like jack sparrow does in the movie so he does n't die in our play battles . however , they seemed rather expensive after buying them and having them shipped . it would be cheaper to use silver dollars or other real us currency that is large and heavy
0	the fan would not inflate the item ... .we ended up putting tissue paper in it to look like it had muscles ... not good at all ... a great disappointment
0	the go-cart is much smaller that it appeared to be . my 2 year old barely fits . these is no reverse and it is a sit in toy . so the child has to get completely out to turn around , or you have to follow them around . the steering column is not straight so the steering wheel has to be sideways to drive straight . all together it is not a very impressive to . my daughter enjoys it very much but i should not have got rid of her lil ' quad .
0	i purchased this for my nephew and my daughter as a present . i was significantly disappointed . with this item having the smithsonian name on it , i expected better construction . while trying to assemble the item , the plastic cracked on the one . the tubes and caps were so loose that i was afraid the bugs would get out into my house . i put silicone around the extremely loose ones . however , i did not seal everything so the critters could breathe . for the price , there are other similar items out there with better construction
1	this was ordered for our 4 year old , she just loves it ! very realistic features , size of set , quality is why fisher price is still the very best for imaginations of all ages ! !
1	my little granddaughters loved receiving this . especially after they figured out the sandbox works best when not dumped on each others heads and the lawn
0	as you can see by other posts - we were all duped by a misleading advertisement . it still shows `` realistic tail movement '' in the listing . hello ! ! ! what tail ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? they have since changed the picture to the doll we all received . the original picture showed the swimming one ( tail attached ) . my daughter was absolutely heartbroken when she opened this and realized this doll has no tail , nor does she swim . i fully expect to be allowed to return this thing ( opened ) at no cost to myself .
1	this is without a doubt the best [ ... ] we have spent on a toy for our 7-year-old son , but it is n't a toy . it 's a highly functional , albeit inexpensive , metal detector . we 've had it now for 3 years and take it camping , etc . it will easily find something as small as a rusty staple , and will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1/4 inches down , very good if you consider how small the detection coil is . when camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes , rusty nails , and the occasional coin . adjusting the sensitivity is trivial , just hold it away from any metal , and turn the sensitivity knob until the red detector led just goes out . other reviewer has noted that the three-piece shaft breaks easily , which happened on ours , but a little duct tape goes a long way and this should n't stop you from buying one . if you get one , make sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the kids to find . ps it also really works great for locating studs and plumbing pipes in walls
0	just received my original big wheel for my son and the axle that holds the back wheels on is not in the box . i call customer service and left a message on their recorder that the part was missing . went to the website for faster service ... ... ... ... ... . after you fill out the information , it tells you that you will have to wait 3 or 4 weeks due to high demand . try telling this to your kid when he is watching feverishly as you open the box . looks like the parts were just thrown into the box without proper packaging . thumbs down until i can get the parts to repair
1	we just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it ! he does n't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time . the scoop and lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings , but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them . overall , this is a great toy for anyone who loves bob the builder . we ca n't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun ! ! lego always makes great and challenging toys !
0	we usually love all the melissa and doug toys , but these sound puzzles are disappointing . i bought two for christmas , the farm one and the vehicle one . we could n't open the back to put in the batteries for the vehicle puzzle ( as the other reviewer said ) , and for this farm one , the sound quality is so bad ! the animal sounds are n't even recognizable in some cases . the puzzle itself is fine , but i would n't recommend paying extra for the sound
0	this is probably one of the best booster packs out there . every monster that comes in the pack has an effect . effect monsters can be very useful . not to mention that my very first pharaonic guardian pack came with a secret rare ! that is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack ! even the common cards are great . such as giant axe mummy or the gravekeeper cards ! your deck can not be complete without this booster pack ! i highly suggest this pack
1	this is the toy with the background music and she 'll play the croc toy along with this one and also dance
0	over priced , cheaply made , bad assembly instructions . it 's a good idea , but a bad product . very over priced . i would not have mined losing out on ten dollars , but 50 plus shipping is a lot . this was the most expensive toy i bought my son for christmas . the bat does not fully swing , because one of the guides block it . you ca n't control the so called pitching , the ball is a magnet that sticks to the playing field . pitch it to the bat and it may not roll to the bat , hit it and it may not make it out of the out field . score board dials wo n't stay attached to the paper score board . it takes two people to operate . it 's the day after christmas and this one is going to the trash . i ca n't send it back because i have attempted to assemble it . it would have to go back in the same condition it was received . i would not recommended this to anyone . my son and i are both very disappointed .
1	i bought this because as a kid my grandparents had one that i would play with constantly everytime i visited , and at the age of 7 was certain i could solve it . i never did , and eventually it broke , and it was n't until i was sitting at my work waiting for my computer to do something , that i thought i needed something to do while i waited for my computer to unfreeze , or for the network to come back online . so i bought a rubiks cube , figured that it was a good portable puzzle thats easy to store , and is only one piece . it came with a display stand , so i keep it displayed next to my monitor , and have co-workers come by and scramble it hoping that i wo n't be able to put it back , but i always have . like i said its a puzzle , but not with alot of pieces , and its portable , so if your taking the bus home , you can kill time with it , then put it back in your briefcase , or backpack . i love it and have n't gotten sick of it yet
0	my daughter got this came for christmas and it is still fun to play , but the new graphics are very confusing and hard to follow . they want a little overboard in their updating of this one . new colors would have been fine , but all the curves , zig-zags , etc , make this version a poor substitute for the older versions . i 'm going to ebay !
0	my daughter had a drink and wet doll that she could give a bath but it filled up with water and even though you could n't empty all the water out , it still leaked everywhere . i got rid of it hoping she would n't notice . well , she did , so a new `` doll i can give a bath to '' was on her christmas list . i wanted to find a solid rubber doll that would not fill up with water . like the dolls i had as a child . i thought this would be it since the top half visible in the box appeared to have no holes . wrong . it has a soft torso filled with polystyrene beads that get waterlogged . the water all ( i hope ) drains out of the bottom of the feet after a couple of minutes of squeezing . then you have to let the torso drip dry . last night after bathtime , my daughter wanted to tuck her doll into to the doll cradle , but could n't because she was still wet . the other features are fine . the shower works great . you do n't have to fill up the fish . just attach it to the tube and squeeze . it suctions water from the bottom of the floaty . the doll does n't sit upright in the floaty , but she does n't flop completely over , either . i do n't care for the bow sewn on to the head . who takes a bath with a bow on ? but if you take it off , she 'll have holes in her head
1	apparently she has loaded this stroller down with dolls , purses etc and has not let it out of her sight since it was delivered ( on time incidentially ! )
0	like many overhead gym type toys , this one turns out to be for short or legless babies . when my daughter kicks the kickplates , she kicks the toy right away from her ( and this is on carpet ) , and when we brace the toy against something , she kicks herself right out from under the toy . we have found the same to be true for a number of similarly designed toys . now that we have looked at the box more closely , the baby in the picture has his/her legs bent really hard in order for the baby to fit under the toy . our daughter is 3 1/2 months old and is already too big for this . on a positive note , this is a very well made toy in all other respects . looks durable , as are all chicco toys , and the music and lights are pleasant . another negative : you apparently have to push the two hanging toys to get them to activate sound and lights , and most babies want to pull them . might be good for a tummy toy , but we 're not waiting for that -- we 'll try the chicco 3 in 1 gym instead , as it appears to be a much better bang for the buck and does not have a kick plate
0	i just recently purchased the red variant of this figure and was excited and pleased to have both a nice looking action figure as well as the piece of apocalypse . but as i was setting him up , trying to move his leg it just snapped off at the hip joint . hence the 2 star durability rating . i have never had this problem with the legends line before , and was very disappointed , especially since it was the variant figure . some superglue fixed the problem , but at the cost of some articulation . he is on my shelf now and looks great , but if you 're giving the toy to younger children , be cautious . like i said i have never had any problems like this with a marvel legends figure before , so hopefully it was just a fluke . the figure is still well worth getting , and in fact i am going to pick up the green version sometime in the near future
0	she is disgusting ! ! ! the only good thing about her is that to scare people away simply show them this doll and they 'll go screaming ! my friend , lucy banette , has this doll . the hair tangles , the clothes rip , and even she admits it sucks ! ! ! her white skin makes her look like a vampire ghost . not one for decoration ! ! ! not even for a 'playing-with ' doll . too fragile and disgustingly sickening to look at ! what are we trying to teach children here ? ? ? that it is good to dress like you have just died ? have you ever seen a goth look like this ? no ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so please , mga , carry on with lil ' bratz . they rule ! ! ! but not your silly gothy , punky bratz . i have two lil ' bratz . they are in the collection 'life style ' . i have sasha and cloe . i do n't know why you called cloe ailani and sasha zada . they are stupid names ! i had to redo their names ! it feels nice to express myself ! bye , to goth haters ! go away , you silly fans of this bratty goth doll
1	this game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations . the luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice . strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have . sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn . all in all , this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it
0	i bought this kit solely for the prism to show my kids how the light split into a rainbow . the prism is such poor quality plastic , that the light does n't even go through it correctly . i could have made a better prism in my oven with plastic pellets and a form . the sides look like a cake top that fell , causing the light to not go through it correctly . the rest of the kit sucks too . i put batteries in the flashlight and the plastic of the flashlight cracked and crumbled in my hand ! the cardboard cutouts are ok ... if you want to pay lots of bucks for cardboard cutouts and the included soda straw .
1	i received this game as a gift and it really is a great ! the book that comes with it would have been a perfect 'cliff notes ' for the art history classes i had in school . my eight-year-old daughter won the first game we played and i 'm re-learning lots of stuff i had forgotten . highly recommended
0	i got this on clearance like 2 years ago . i new it would not hold up . i had many kids on it because i do home daycare . my rule was only 3 kids at a time . the bigger kids could only go on 2 at a time . it got 3 holes which i patched . they even took naps in it . i must of had it for about 6 months and only keep it up for like a week at a time . my problem was it was hard to store . i had to leave it inflated some and pushed it in back of my closet . finaly one of the big kid did a big belly flop on it and popped the seem . no way was that fixable . if i ever find it on clearance again i would buy it but not for what they are asking for it . not worth it if it will break in a couple of months
1	my 5 and 7 year-old granddaughters love baby alive . this doll held their attention even to the exclusion of the other stuff they `` really wanted '' for christmas . and the doll is adorable ! even the adults were fascinated . fun and educational
1	this toy is great for little boys or girls who love equipment . i got this item for my son 2 nd birthday gift and he just loves it . it is a tiny tractor and it is just like his grandpa 's tractor so which makes him a very happy little boy . this is a great item
1	not only is the 90 's game fun and enjoyable to play , but the questions and answers bring back lasting memories of movies , sports , tv shows and meaningful events from the decade . correctly answering questions by relating them to personal memories and experiences allows all players to relive their experiences from the 90 's . whether you were a student , young adult or parent during the 90 's , this game is sure to invoke sentimental feelings . i highly recommend it for groups of friends and families
1	the test of a toy is if the child loves it . this toy was perfect
0	my husband and i have ignored many poor reviews in choosing toys for our 18-month old and have often been pleasantly surprised to see our son thoroughly enjoying such toys . unfortunately , this was not the case with the peg perego thomas ride-on train . he is exceptionally tall and strong for his age , yet there is no way his hand could possibly depress the button required to keep the train moving , much less hold it down for any length of time . so the operation of the train requires an adult to depress the button and spin in circles while your child bats your hand away and is totally distracted from the experience . my son enjoys pushing the train along the track more than riding it . however , the train is flimsy and easily comes off the track , so this usually lasts a few seconds before he is again frustrated and annoyed . all this and then you need to get out the screwdriver to charge the battery every time you `` play '' with it . do n't buy this toy or you will be kicking yourselves like we are . it 's a gimmicky piece of plastic junk that even major thomas-lovers will probably not enjoy .
1	this kitchen is not the first one i 've purchased . i am more happy with this one than the other two i have purchased . it has plenty of storage space for all the food and gives the child more doors to open and be more creative . i am very happy with this kitchen , it 's durable and a good buy
0	i bought this toy for my four year old for christmas thinking it would be the perfect toy for her since she loves care bears and she loves the game hide and seek . this toy was a big disappointment ! she was so excited when she opened the package but when we tried to play with it , she got frustrated and lost intrest very quickly . the care bear `` finder '' does not give good clues to where the care bear is hiding and makes it very confusing for a child . it was saying `` come find me '' even when she was within a couple feet of it and she had to be right on top of it before it would tell her that she 's `` getting warmer . '' it does n't let the child know that they are getting close to it until they can see it . my daughter gave up on it quickly because she would be wandering the house aimlessly without any clue as to it 's where abouts . i do not recommend this toy to any one . i would have given it no stars , but she does like the bear itself . do yourself a favor ... buy a care bear ( much cheaper ) , hide it somewhere , and you can truthfully tell your child when they are `` getting warmer !
0	i purchased this toy for our friends son and i can not tell you the disappointed look on his face when we all realized what a piece of trash this toy is ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do not buy it ! ! ! we are returning it asap ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it 's cheap , it 's not sturdy and it does not close back up again ! 4 adults could n't get it back together ! never mind a kid ! it is a total ripoff ... this is the first time i have ever written a review on a toy , thats how horrible it is
0	i bought this toy for my 9 year old son who loved it at first but after awhile he was dissapointed . it stopped working correctly on one side . the remote may be the problem , i am not sure . we changed the batteries but that did not help . i felt bad i bought him a christmas gift that did n't last the day
0	i was looking for a durable tape player for the kids and this was not it . the microphone only worked for a couple of weeks . it plays tapes ok but would have liked to play with the other features before they stopped functioning . my kids are rough on toys but not that rough
0	i bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the dollar tree . when i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures i decided to give them a try . i have two complaints with this product . one , the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and i could'nt get one of the phones to communicate . the pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone .
1	this deck is amazing the best structure deck out there . i 'm a warrior fan so i loved it . its great for begginers just add the e-heroes and its perfect !
1	being the first ravensburger puzzle i have ever owned , it is without a doubt the best quality and the best detailed puzzle i have ever worked with . the quality of the product is shown throughout , from the sturdy container , practically sediment free packaging , the exact cuttings of the each puzzle piece ( not a single one was still attached to another puzzle piece and there were only one or two frayed cut spots in the whole set ) , and the high quality graphic printing . the puzzle itself is made difficult primarily by the use of similar colors throughout . the puzzle pieces are otherwise the standard cut type . the resulting artwork is something that we 've decided to actually frame and hang in my office , which we have never done over the years ( puzzles can be very calming to work on after a long week of long and stressful work hours - especially when working on them with others ) . the puzzle cuts are so well done that it is not entirely easy for someone to tell that it is a puzzle from general glancing unless they get up close ( within 2 feet ) and look at the detail . i will definitely buy more ravensburger puzzles and hope that they come out with even more puzzles of this type ( old world maps ) and same quality
1	we wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06 . we bought a lot of m toys and this by far was the better of their toys . even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out . like other said the sound is very appropriate . i like this toy and definitely recommend this to others . the only reason i gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful
0	my girls got this puzzle for christmas . the first time they were playing with it i noticed something in my daughters mouth . the items that were on the puzzle piece had came off which had a screws and washers that were holding them on . three of the five puzzle picecs had the item come off and we had about ten screws and ten washers . they are such small pieces which i was so shocked that this puzzle was even made this way . i just wanted any parent who has this puzzle or is thinking of buying it to be careful and make sure the items are attached teh correct way . i have contacted consumers affairs to look into having this puzzle recalled . hope this will help another child from being hurt
0	i bought this product for my children because it looked neat ! what they do n't tell you is that the paint must be diluted before you can use it ( why not include the pre-diluted paint ? but i digress ... . ) . even after thinning the paint , the product hardly spins . if we could get it to work , it seemed like a neat concept . but it just does n't work . i have no idea if it is because it needs very thin paint or the motor is weak or what . we returned ours for a refund
0	the kids got it for christmas , and it looked like fun . however , the one we got does n't work at all . i 'm not sure if we just got a bad one or if this problem is common , but i ca n't even get it to turn on without changing the batteries , and then i ca n't get it to go into the game mode . plus , the rules of the electronic version are different , in that you lose all your points if you keep acting out words . i prefer the rules of the old version better . i 'm planning to return this and get the old version
0	what a waste of monee . i do not think this is a nice gift for anyone . boo . the en
0	i ca n't believe that they actually put the word 3-d on the box of this thing . how dare they advertise this as a fun and usefull learning experience . i wish i had read the reviews before i bought it . there is absolutely no 3d value to this at all . they should have just made it plain 2d and then it would have been cool
0	purchased this for our grandchildren . it did not work ! unfortunately we had thrown away the original packaging , so i assumed that it could not be returned . it gets zero stars from this household even if the form does require at least one star be entered .
0	christmas day the train transformer did not give power to the train set . all connections were verified as was the instruction booklet to verify proper connections . it still did not work . the online merchant gave ony 14 days from date it was shipped to return for defect , and lional was closed for the holiday until dec 28th . when lionel was finally reached , the tech department especially mr dedeppo were completely unwilling to listen to the train problems and acted completely unprofessional yelling and speaking in a most agitated amd unhelpful manor . additional phone calls were placed to lionel and no person was able to give the required information to ensure the product was defective and therefore refundable according to the return policy of the amazon.com retailer . buyer beware the good name of lionel seems to be a memory , in this instance , the current manufacturer allow their employess to harrass and threaten customers who spent a large amount of money on their product without any responsibility for their defect . i would only buy a lional train that is either vintage or made by lionel prior to the current ownership
0	i bought this toy from my son for his 2nd birthday less than a week ago . it is designed for the sandbox , but has already stopped working because sand has gotten into all the sliding parts . it also has a locking mechanism that is too difficult for even my almost 4 year old to figure out . but my kids love to ride around on it , it 's just too bad the rest of it is so poorly designed
1	this was exactly what i was looking for to complete my little set
0	this toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow the dozen or so chambers up . the instructions were terrible . you have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next . the chambers do not stay inflated and some do n't work at all . my son does still have fun with it but i would n't buy it again
1	this case is nice and tough , it holds all the accessories for the fp3 player securely . i gave it 4 stars because i think things like fp3 players need a home and it serves that purpose great . it matches with the player and is built to withstand kids . i did take a star off my rating because , as it does have a smallish loop to hold it by , it should really have a handle . little hands need something easy to hold on to , and the little loop does not suffice for any purpose i could see
0	my four year old picked this toy out with a gift certificate given to him by his grandmother . he already had pirate sets made by playmobil , but this looked like an interesting addition to the sets . well , set up took nearly an hour for his very mechanically able father , and almost as soon as he began to play with it , pieces fell apart . note : he is not a careless child , nor is he rough with toys . but this toy does n't stand up to even the most basic four year old play . after he had had it up without playing with it for six months , we finally just boxed it . we found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at a garage sale . i just hope those people do n't come back to reclaim their money . save yourself the pain and frustration and buy playmobil 's pirate lagoon -- this is just a cheap knockoff
0	let 's see . you need two different batteries and two different sized screwdrivers . so after buying the 9v for the remote control and searching for a long enough screwdriver to open the bus to put in the double as ... i turned it on . *honk ! *honk ! * it 's loud . really loud . ugh
1	i have a three year old son , he loves these take along toys . we take them every where with us . the tracks stay together very well we move them from room to room and never have to take them apart . we have almost every part of the take along thomas the train items
1	my 4.5 year old loves this ! awesome way for young kids to learn god 's word ! i wish there were more . my daughter has n't put it down since we bought it
0	although crayola is a wonderful brand , i was not impressed with their color wonder fingerpaints . the time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them , and they get frustrated . it is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture . also , it is not `` mess free . '' the paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch ( other than paper ) anyways . i did not like how mushy the paint was ... i am still finding globs of it everywhere
1	this hoop is tight , but wene you shoot it makes a ton of noise . if your planing on buying this be aware of a lot noise . also the hoop , and the net sometimes come off
1	this is a great table/chairs set.. my 22 month old is enjoying it but may be a little to young.. the chairs tip very easily . other than that its a great set .
0	it can be almost impossible to turn at times . instead of moving one to the right , you have to go three to the left , or fiddle with it so it lines up properly . you can still solve the cube but it gets annoying when it does n't move the way you want it to . i was hoping it 'd be better cause it 's really cool that it fits in your pocket . it 's just too hard to turn . i ended up breaking the thing trying to get it to turn one way . and i cant put it back together cause one of the pieces is missing . i really like this product ( i 'm buying another one ) , i just wish it was n't so stiff . maybe they made it stiff so it would n't turn in your pocket but if you know how to do it , you can finish a rubik 's cube in 5 minutes , max , so i do n't see the need to prevent it from turning . apparently they thought people would solve like half of it and finish it latter
1	i thought that this would be toy my daughter would grow into and not be excited about at first . this was the first toy she opened at christmas at only 19 months and was not interested in any others for the rest of the week ! she enjoyed collecting the fingers and and `` counting '' them . she also has grown in the last few months to putting the puzzle together herself although the fingers might not make it on the correct hand just yet . very durable , love that it is a traditional wood toy that does n't have flashing lights or needs batteries ! she still loves it months later . the only downside to any toy like this , is we have to collect the pieces after she has put them in various places around the house .
1	my 2 year old son loves this puzzle . the large pieces are easy to handle , and the colorful pictures keep him entertained . it keeps him engaged and he 's very proud once he 's completed it
1	bought blue , majenta and periwinkle for my 2 youngest . the kids love them ! i have been purchasing ty products since their inception about 10 years age . i am so glad the 've branched into some characters my kids love : blue 's clue 's and backyardigans . looking forward to more in the blue 's clue 's line !
1	i ought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday . she loves the bead maze at the top and she goes round and round the cube exploring all the different sides ! so as the title would suggest , the stickers on the cog wheels are starting to come off ( after 1 week ) . this doesnt affect the functionality of the toy , just the aesthetics . if you are not bothered by some bare cogwheels this is still a great toy ! it stands 2 feet tall to the top of the maze and is the perfect height for little ones . the other 3 sides are : abc with pictures rotating blocks , abacus , sliding plastic pegs . the only side with stickers is the cog wheels so no worries about other sides losing stickers . if they had made the cog wheels out of wood or had the design painted or imprinted into the plastic this toy would be a 10

0	please be careful and make sure you can see your baby when playing with these keys . the plastic ring holding the keys can break . we found the small broken piece in our baby 's mouth ! we received this toy only three weeks ago
0	if you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in ! also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet . they are made with known cancer causing chemicals . they are also manufactured over seas wher the deq , epa etc ; have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers . my two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage . did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers . benzene , poly vinyl chloride , all kill the liver .
0	just about everything negative that can be said about this doll has been said here , but i still feel that i have to put my two cents in . my daughter will be nine next month and , as always , she wants a barbie doll for her birthday . this is one doll that not only will my daughter not be getting , but one that she will never even see if i can help it . little girls love things that are shiny and sparkly and glitzy , but this doll goes way beyond that . the doll looks like a [ ... ] . the clothes and makeup just do not make sense in any other context . yes , it 's just a doll , and it 's the parent 's responsibility -- not the toy company 's -- to teach kids what is okay and what is n't . but do you want your sweet little girl looking at this and imagining how pretty she will look one day in a crotch-length skirt ?
0	gave this heli to my 30 year old son on his birthday . it was supposed to be easy to fly . it rolled over and crashed inches off the ground on its maiden flight , spewing propeller parts everywhere . with all retailers out of replacement parts it may never fly . if you buy this heli , do n't buy it through the mail or online but from a local dealer with parts and expertise to help you get it back together
1	my child loves this little crib . i think the canopy was the winning feature and the rollers . she can easily move it without having to carry it to the next room . all her dolls fit the crib . we really think it works . it is n't as sturdy as a wooden crib , but it has n't come apart on us
1	i think i missed the boat on this one ; i bought it for xmas for my 13 month old and the only real play it gets is when my daughter and her 3 year old brother take off the `` play top '' and sit inside it ! they think thats fun but thats about it
0	i played this at a friend 's party , and it was a wretched party game . it basically consists of a person reading the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to attempt to figure it out . it is incredibly monotonous , and a throughly awful game to play at a party . i admire its cleverness . it took a lot of creativity and know-how to make up these challenging puzzles . but for the sake of all your guests , i emplore you : hide this boring game . hide it as well as possible . the painful thing is that out of a choice between mad gab and lost : the game my friend chose mad gab . it 's sad , really
1	both of my kids got these for christmas - great idea ; not as expensive as a dvd player for the car ( especially for those of us who do n't want the portable one/plan to get next vehicle with built in ) and the picture was really better than i thought it would be . however , i only got my children two discs a piece to start . now , no discs worthwhile can be found anywhere . the only ones that are ever on the racks/online en masse are the star wars 3 pack ( none of today 's kids really want that ) , the tony hawk skate park ( obviously they are n't interested there either ) and fear factor ( let 's face it , if you let your kids watch ff you need to take the videonow player and hit yourself in the head - hard ) .and even if i do find a couple on ebay , the selection is so limited . i wish i 'd just bought a cheap portable dvd player . hasbro really missed the boat on this one - it could have been a great thing but they did n't make enough discs of the ones they do produce and need to put more shows out for the kids . my advice : do n't buy it . i am very disappointed in the disc selection - this is already at the bottom of the toy box .
1	deductive reasoning at its best . awesome and absolutely brilliant . i got this for my 8 year old daughter and my hisband and i have taken turns to play with her , and we have been late for dinner many times -- - not anting to get up till we finish the game . i recommend it highly for parents who want to spend some quality time with their kids
1	its the best table out there . i did a lot of research and now have a year of `` testing . '' we bought it for my daughter when she was 1 , and she 's almost 3 . i also run a daycare . the chairs do n't tip and various ages from 2-5 have put them to their worst . it cleans easily and is easy to put aside , if needed . i did have to replace a chair once ( i stood on it . ) and the customer service was fast and friendly .
0	my friends and i spend hours selling lemonade using this stand ! !
0	this appealed to me since i would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile , but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways . i liked to idea , but just does n't work . this mobile constantly stops working ( before the 8 minutes are up ) ... it stops going round . the music continues the lights are still on , but the base stops rotating , it seems as though it always gets `` stuck '' and we have to push it to get `` unstuck '' . we 've changed the battery and that does n't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck , i contacted mattel to get a voucher since it 's been more than 90 days since i bought this , ca n't return it in the store . ( it 's kind of big and ugly too , did n't expect that from the picture .
0	this game fell apart after we got out of the box . i did n't even get a chance to play this with my five year old before it fell apart . be careful , i would n't get this if you have children who are rough on their toys..
0	this deck stunk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! that is of course ... .if you did n't find the combos . i have won tons of tournaments with my exodia deck.once i entered a tournament with this.i found alot of combos . i deafeted two guys with it.i 'm not using it again . it was pretty good . but hey , that 's a starter deck for you .
1	excellent ! my 2 yrs . old grandson is loving it . i purchased a storage case for his melissa doug puzzles , and it helps keep them organized and neat . much appreciated by mom dad
0	hi.everyone gues what i went to toys r us and amazon.com and i saw these hamsters . i thaught they were just too tenderly sweet for me . so i asked my mum over like abillion times . can i get this mom no she said.2 minutes later can i get this mom no she said again.then i really started begging her that she just suddenly agreeed . now just remember do n't always beg your parents cause the secret is if you ask your parents once and they say no then be really good for about a week and then they might surprise you with you'r special tenderly sweet toy . so now remember i am and always will be raiting 5 stars . so just please try to test this . boys might even like it . if you listen to me and get it you can/could still return it okay bi friends ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! you really did me a fauvor
1	why do some people call bratz dolls 'sluts/slutz ' ? are you guys mad ? they are just dolls . they are made of plastics . so what they wear short mini skirt ? they just dolls . if you hated mini skirt soooo much , well do n't wear them . i saw many teenage celebs wear mini skirts . they are just dolls , okay ? no need to argue if they wear short mini skirts . anyway , about this doll i am totally adore her . she is very pretty and very rockstar material ( i do n't know how 2 spell.i do n't care about her having tatoos . lot of celeb got tatoos and she 's a rockstar material .
1	i do n't care if it stops working tomorrow ... my daughter has gotten so much enjoyment out of this in just one day that it was totally worth the money . ( you can get them cheaper at target though ) she was always stealing the portable phones around the house or walking off with my cell phone ... and now she has `` her '' phone she is just delighted ... . she loves when it rings and she opens it up and pretends to talk ... . so far this phone works great , but like i said ... it is such a cool toy i 'd go out and buy a new one right away .
0	hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it . easily assembled , up within 60 seconds . i have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway , presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground . there was no rope or stakes with the purchase , i am unaware if these should have been included . two entrances into the hideaway , the front inverted t entrance is great . however , the rear is a porthole type entrance , not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom . material not that durable , but with care there should be no issues . a lot bigger than it looks on the site , which was a nice surprise .
0	of all the first leappad books to buy , make this the last one on your list . my daughter has no interest in this one whatsoever ! & lt ; br / & gt ; & lt ; br / & gt ; ( i have two friends who have said the same thing .
1	my two year old son got this pooh bear for a `` birth '' gift . he brings him everywhere . it 's great because it does n't take up much room . he has two now , but let me tell you he can tell them apart ! ! ! the tag on his `` first '' one is slightly more worn after countless washings and he likes that one best . the `` other one pooh bear '' as he calls it , works only in emergencies . my 9 mo . old daughter is getting the piglet since she loves the pooh too but there was no chance of my son giving one up . buy this toy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	this is a cute idea , and a cute design , but ! it is not realistic ! when you put your babydoll inside , it takes a bit , esp . for a child to get the sling hanging around neck correctly and turned right , then , the poor baby doll falls , directly out of it , no back support on it , the only way she stays in is if your hands never leave her ! so if the price , which is on sale right now , lures you , i would suggest an older child , rather than , say 3 , or so , my 3 year old , doesnt like it , and for her abilities , i dont like it either , but now , my 6 year old , she can do it , when she is being patient enough ! only 2 stars given , for its cuteness and price at the moment , otherwise too difficult and unsupportive to suit my girls : )
0	first , the volvo wagon is supposed to be scaled for the midge series of barbie dolls , slightly smaller than regular barbie . another annoyance , it comes with a little pink roll-on suitcase full of microscopic fisher-price replica toys that have nothing to do with the volvo . i put all the tiny pieces together in the suitcase for my granddaughter and the suitcase would n't close . i looked on the box illustrations , and sure enough , they show a suitcase not closed . how could they design such a silly bunch of add-ons ? i just got rid of all that teeny-tiny stuff that does n't relate to the inherent play value of the car . any kid would prefer to put her/his own stuff into a little suitcase than this mishmash of silly product promo from fisher-price . would have been nice to have a choice of colors , even approximately the real colors that the volvo wagon comes in . i just wanted my granddaughter to be able to play-like with grandma 's white volvo wagon . how hard should that be ? overall , i 'm disappointed with this toy . for 28 $ , shipping included , i expected a better toy . not worth the money
1	this is a great game that is made very well . it is nice and solid wood construction with great bright colors . it will last us many years . i bought it for a small carnival style fundraising event that we needed games for children to play . it will surely be a hit ! my daughter ( 8 years old ) tried it out and really enjoyed playing with it . it has three bean bags of different weights making the game differing in difficulty . i would recommend this game to any one looking for entertainment for children . this game is best played on a table , so that a child can stand and throw the bean bags
1	this toy is awesome , i am a starwars fanatic so i 'll get anything starwars . but not cheesy like the darth vader voice changer . overall this toy is great
0	we were so excited to order this item . sadly the quality is very poor . we have had it set up for less than a week and the front `` counter '' has broken off and one of the front panels has had a leg rip off . my kids love the idea of this item but it is extremely flimsy particle type board -it has basically disintergrated berfore our eyes . even with general play it sways back and forth , a little scary if little ones are playing in it.i am going to call the maker - hopefully we can repair this ( ...
1	just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey- he only has use of his right hand- this cartridge is perfect- game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both . since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games- he 's hooked . is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short
0	this game is for people to play if they 're drunk or mindless ... or in some cases both ... .it 's completely pointless and uninteresting ... if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid ... sorry but i mean think about it ? ... why pay money for this when i can just use dice from other more interesting board games i already own ? do not waste your money ! ~*even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little ... you still should n't buy it ... b/c like i said before just use dice from other board games you already own !
1	i played this game at a super bowl party and decided to order one for myself . my 8 year-old loved playing it and we recently took it to a family reunion and everyone there liked it too
0	my 5 yr. old son got this for christmas and played with it only while we where watching ( so we know he did n't do anything to break it ) . the day after christmas morning it stopped working ... we changed the batteries that came with it and still it made noise but no longer would the shovel go up and down nor would it go in reverse . i bought this from toys r us in our hometown . i threw the box away on christmas day so i ca n't take it back . i will try calling the company .
1	wingo looks like the real car from the movie , drives great , it was a hit with both my boys ages 3 and 6 . the color on the car is bright and just like the one in the movie , the back of the car is exactly like the one in the movie . my boys were very excited to see it ! they play and act out the whole cars movie with all their cars
0	within the first hour of buying this product the second hand broke off and caused the hands not to turn.. was very flimsy and not well made . i would not recommend this product to anyone unless you enjoy dissappointing your children ! ! ! ! !
0	i had to return this product for my son because i could n't get his name which is unique . if they make a product they should have something on it to make unique names by typing it in if it 's not on the list . i mean there are more and more unique name sout there and there sure will be more . if i was a rich person i am sure i could have had one made just for him . get witht the real world people and make things so unique people can have things too .
1	gave this to my 6 year old for his birthday . i helped him to construct it from the clear ( no reading ) directions along with my 10-year old daughter . the pieces go together flawlessly - the engineering of the plastic is superb . the elevator works as designed and the battery pack ( 2xaa ) connects via a short cord - very convenient . he has already spent many hours playing with it
0	do n't buy this unless you plan on attaching the remote to your forehead with duct-tape ; if you lose the remote you can not operate the moon . the moon also has an automatic time that it comes on ; it 's supposed to be when it gets dark , but it comes on way too early to be any good , because nobody is in their room that early , and it only stays on for 30 minutes . when it comes on by itself , ( because its too early ) you can barely notice it is on .
0	bought at toys r us for 8 year old . had fun putting it together , and like i said it looks cool . however , you barely touch it while playing with it , and it falls apart . even frustrating for a kid . i would expect better quality for $ 40 . probably will return
1	i love this kit -- the puppies are so cute and the project is really fun . i loved the finished craft and it gave my children the freedom to creat whatever they wanted . would like to buy more of these to make a whole kennel and to give as birthday and holiday gifts . all we needed was in the box and the directions were so easy to follow
1	this is a perfect game that you can enjoy with the whole family ! it is very fun and great for little ones too ! i own this game , and my family enjoys it very much . this is a great mystery game where you spy to find out each pearson 's idenity . i love this game and i think you would too
0	falls over constantly . fustrating for everyone . only good thing is the sleeping bag that comes with it
1	this doll is so beautful . back off everybody , i am the bratz number 1 fan with over 120 of them ! seriously , and thats not all , i go on the website 4 hours a day , and am collecting bratz babyz and have many bratz furniture . consider me the bratz expert . ok so hi everybody ! i 'm here to give you some tips 'n ' tricks as well as handy hints on this particular talking bratz doll , who is my fave character yasmin ! this doll , for starters , is a mixture of diferent bratz collections . she has a bratz princess t-shirt , wildwest cowboy a-go-go boots , forever diamonds fur , bratz fabulous coat and passion for fashion miniskirt . i mean whoa ! if you wanted to buy any of those dolls listed above , just get this ! she is a mixture of all ! secondly , she talks ! which is great . she is also interactive , saying over 125 phrases . if you place her with other talking bratz dolls , she will get excited and start to have a conversation ! she can also talk to you if you are lonely . she has a sensor so she 'knows ' what yor saying and can give a correct answer ! also , she 'll be your best friend at nightime . her lips light up while she speaks ! the base at the bottom can be removed so she can be like a regular bratz doll ! if you , however , press the button on the base , her lips wll still light up as she speaks . and at only $ 19.99 , parents , all of you parents out there , you do n't know what your missing
0	my daughter wanted a sewing machine for her 8th birthday . i thought it would be a good introduction to sewing instead of using my adult machine , but it was a mistake because the singer lockstitch sewing machine only worked once , when we first tried and this was it . i tried to work on it but it is so cheaply made that no wonder it does n't work more than once . unfortunatelly by the time we realize , i could not return it , because the box was in the garbagge . it is just a big waste of money . do n't buy it
1	a great game for the whole family . my visiting swedish friend enjoyed playing so much that she bought one to bring back home with her . if you like sequence you will have fun with kings in the corner
1	i probably play over a hundred games of solitaire a night . i have a hard time sleeping but this game , after playing as many as i do , makes me go to sleep . i have n't read a book in over two months which to me is remarkable because i have read at night ever since junior high . i am now 62 and playing solitaire . thank goodness for it
0	i got this for my daughter who will be 10 in feb. she has wanted a sewing machine very badly . this one is made of cheap plastic , and no matter how many times we read the instructions and try to close the end , as soon as we remove it , it unravels . i think i 'd spend more money and get something better . as my daughter says `` it 's very irriating . ''
1	my daughter is 2 1/2 years old and i often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing . after dinner i find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine . she has learned how to button , use a zipper and problem solve by using this book . also , i find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible . i have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it
0	this is the cutest furreal i have seen it could have been much better if they would have made it where it would open it 's mouth . ... why did it come with a bottle ? all ir does is grunt and beg . does n't walk and it 's eyes do not close so you ca n't pretend it is asleep . i ca n't return it cause it was a valantine 's present but at least it is cute as just a stuffed pig
0	we were very disappointed in this toy . it does not spin fast enough to make the paint spray evenly over the cardboard . my older children had a spin art toy that was great . it made the most spectacular designs . this is not worth the effort or money
0	my 9-yr old received this toy as a birthday present . of course it looks cool . against my better judgement of immediately returning it , we opened , played for 10 mins , got frustrated , and will now return it . the boys were very patient adusting the straps properly to their bodies ( it took 20 mins ) . seems like good quality wiring - i was afraid they 'd pull at it while strapping in , but it did n't . must stand 10 feet away from each other ( a good thing ! ) . the punch/block sounds are cool , but the boys got very confused trying to figure out who scored , what the lights on chestplate meant , etc . it 's possible that you must go slow and perhaps wait for 1 player to throw punch . then block . difficult for excited boys to be so choreographed and patient ! block with opposite hand of partner 's throwing punch hand while squeezing a button on palm strap of your other hand . there 's some maneuvering to get used to . but within 10 minutes , all sound/power went down , and we could n't get it to recharge/work again . it 's supposed to recharge quickly so i do n't know what the problem is . instructions say when nothing happens , change batteries ... but 10 mins into game ? hmmm . too frustrating for all the effort
1	best price i saw for this doll and it came in the mail in a very short time , wrapped securely . i love when you can shop online , beat the crowds and get quality merchandise . beautiful doll too
1	i got this message from the recipient 's mother : he loves it , really ! well-made drawer - shelf design . it 's heartwarming when he settles down industriously using his art supplies
0	3 stars overall only b/c we love c3 ! read on ... the batcave c3 set has some rather intense structural integrity problems that cause it to be next to impossible to put together without a supplemental `` fix-it '' set that was distributed by the mfg . after many seasoned adults protested their frustrations with its construction . since the company has now withdrawn all c3 items from its website , it is not known whether the `` fix-it '' package is still available ( it included thicker , stronger support pieces for the first floor , and additional pieces for a stairway support column ) . without these , the set tends to implode well before you ever get the 2nd level completed , let alone the 3rd ! after all the problems started surfacing , the company also increased the `` recommended age range '' to 7+ from the previous 4+ . if you purchase a box that states 7+ as the age range , it should include the `` fix '' parts ( no guarantee , we 're only assuming ) , but even with the `` fix '' pieces , it is still a major headache to put together , and your true calling is an architect if you manage to get it safely together on the first try . it takes most adults several tries over several days ( due to frustration stress level ) to get this piece fully assembled . there is a step-by-step construction guide showing the problems ( with `` crash '' pictures ) in set construction , amazon rules say i ca n't post the link here , but it should n't be too hard to find if you enter c3 batcave in a search engine , the full write-up is in a c3 forum . i know many people may still purchase -- it is after all , batman , but i would at least try to see if you can acquire the replacement parts before ordering , as you will have much greater chance for success . or wait until you get the package , if it says 7+ on the box , you just may be in luck . in the alternative , maybe you could use super-glue to the existing inadequate structural supports ? or , raid your kid 's lego stash and use thicker , more stable blocks than the ones supplied with this set
0	this toy does not work . i do not recommend it . there is no quality to the workmanship . a total disappointmen
0	you ca n't be serious . we are not in the caveman era , you know . we have games to play that involve strategy . this game is pure luck - roll a die , roll a die , lose . it is like playing roulette . even blackjack and monopoly have choices . there is no way in which a `` good player '' can win in this game more often than a `` bad player '' , as there is no way to be good or bad at this game . we have eurogames . we have games that involve strategy . we do not need this baseless luckfest
0	i popped in the batteries and was unable to get any sound whatsoever . i even put in a different set up batteries ; still , no dice . this is the worst excuse for a keyboard ever . i am sorry that i will be pitching this in the trash and it will take up space in a landfill . after the reading the other reviews , perhaps i am fortunate that this clunker never even made a sound . i gather that i 'm not missing much .
1	this toy was bought for my son ( 14 months ) because he has an obsession with the phone . my son instantly loved this toy and has been a great subsitute when he is reaching for the phone and i 'm on it . it is a great travel toy as well . being in the armed forces , we are constantly on the move and he loves sitting in his car seat on the rides and playing with his phone . sure this toy gets a bit old after a bit but it 's a small price to pay for your kids true happiness . my one gripe with this phone is that within two days of him playing with it , he broke the center button that flips the features . we returned it to the store and have not been able to find it except online . i 'm sure it was just a fluke flaw and am buying it again
0	i bought these for my 13-year old niece , who loves percussion , and was so excited to get them for christmas . they looked like a great buy . well , the disappointment was palpable two hours later . we got them hooked up , installed appropriate batteries etc. , and the light was on , but we could not get any sound from the drumsticks at all . which was a bummer , but ok , if we could simply either ( 1 ) get help or ( 2 ) easily replace them . nope . the `` instructions '' were a tiny folded sheet of paper , there is absolutely no troubleshooting , no help , no nothing . i went through everything that came with them but could find anything to help us on next steps or returns , etc . i finally retrieved the original plastic packaging and found a url in tiny letters for the company . but when i went there , the site again offered no help , tips , or troubleshooting ( just a pdf of the really awful original instructions ) . there is video on the website showing someone playing the drumsticks but this was no help to us in trying to troubleshoot ( except to mildly disappoint my niece when she realized that you have to drum `` in the air '' to get the best results -- which we did try , with no luck or sound , again ) . i next e-mailed the company and got no response . i e-mailed them again and -- seven days later -- the e-mail ( in badly worded english ) simply asked me if we had tried `` plugging in the head phones . '' seriously . anyway , do not waste your money . a terrible product , no support , and no recourse if it does n't work as it should
1	this is a single player game . set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic . the puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated . by the end , the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before . both kids love it- ages 4 and 9 . we helped the four-year-old learn the tricks by just asking `` whoes in that cars way ? '' then `` whoes in the trucks way ? '' until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards
0	our daughters are four and five years old . the skates will not fit over our five year old 's shoe . the ad clearly says three to seven years old
0	my son expected the tie to be maroon and it is definately purple so we were extremely disappointed and returned it ! amazon was very prompt in refunding out money
0	my daughter loves this toy . she has the treehouse and the school house , she plays with them often . my only complaint is that they fall apart . she does not mind , i just snap it back together and she keeps playing .
0	this obviously is a re-release of the old `` empire strikes back '' kit released in the 80 's . a decent size kit ( approx 15 inches ) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing . the kit is relatively easy to build out of the box , but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector dome on top of the ship . these inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies . however , the kit is worth the price . my only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new `` republic star destroyer '' from `` revenge of the sith '' . the new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long . in order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version , it would need to be about 24 inches long . hopefully someone will make the `` imperial star destroyer '' to that scale .
0	`` phase 10 '' is little more than an uno knockoff -- even sharing some of the same `` special '' cards : `` skip '' and `` wild '' . then , there are the so-called `` phases '' , which can ultimately be frustrating for both young players , and new players . example : phase 3 is a set of 4 cards ( 4 of the same number ) and a run of 4 cards ( a straight ) . you may have the following cards : ( g=green , r=red , b=blue , o=orange ) 2g , 3r , 4r , 6o , 6g , 9b , 11b , 11r , 12b , wild . ultimaely , the player before you draws a `` wild '' card , and completes their phase . you , however get stuck with 85 points . with all the flaws , the game can still be competitive and fun . if you want something educational though , buy a leappad
0	do n't get me wrong ... the concept of this toy if fantastic ... and when it works it is wonderful ... .however , it sucks up so many batteries it is not even funny ! it requres 4 c batteries and we replace them at least every 3 weeks ! not only that but there is something wrong with the toy that makes it stick in the `` on '' position even after you turn it off ( very loud and sqeaky '' . v-tech knows of this problem but tell you when you call to `` take the batteries our and turn it off and on 20 times to reset it '' . well , that will work a few times but then the toy is totally broken . and ... their idea is for you to send it to them and they will take 2 weesk to send you a replacement ... .hmm ... .is this not a toy marketed to help children sleep ... so we obviously need it at bedtime ! i offered to apy them up front for a new one and they could reimburse me but they would not bend . needless to say i am quite frustrated with v-tech ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if they know it is a problem they should tell you that on the first call so something can be done about it ! ! ! another creepy side note ... .the thing says `` i love you '' in some strange voice to your child ... ... scary ! v-tech has a great idea here and it is the best toy of its type ... however , it does n't work ... .looks like they came out with the technology a bit too soon ! btw ... i rated durability as a 1 and amazon has it showing as 3 stars ... hmmmm !
1	i bought this doll for my 5 year old granddaughter . she love 's this doll and take 's it with her every where she goes.people alway 's make a remark how much fun the doll is even grown up 's want to play with it.just make sure the child you give it to is there when you set her up , because the child will have to answer the question 's that allysen ask's.setting her up was very easy.she truely is a interacting playmate.i would highly recomend this doll
0	this is not a very fun toy . my [ ... ] got tired of filling the paint chamber because it would empty so quickly . he also ended up dipping the brush into the paint jars . he went through both jars of paint in under 10 minutes and was finished with the toy . there was n't enough paint to even create a picture . the happy birthday pic on the back of the package must 've taken over 20 bottles and a very skilled artist . i think crayola should stick to making crayons
0	i bought this toy for my son ( the boy 's version ) for his 2nd birthday . it was fun for a few days ... until he went head over heels on a very small slope in our yard . the toy landed on top of him , with his neck rolled and pinned under the toy . he was so terrified of it after that , he refused to get back on . it has been stored in our basement and will be sold at the next yard sale . save your money - this toy is too tipsey for toddlers and way too fast for them to control the steering
0	just my opinion ; but i have a hard time finding books to go with my 3yr old daughter 's first leap pad . she loves maurice sendak 's where the wild things are and she loves many of the other books that go with the leap pad that is for 6mo-24mo age range . i think they should have done a bit more research on which stories were associated with which leap pad system . as for the pooh bear game ; i agree ; way too easy here ; this would have been perfect for the leap pad made for younger children , and made a more challenging one for this level . great idea ; just not well put together
1	i 'm not sure why so many of these ( all ? ) reviews are for a different product , but this one is actually for the balancing bike . we got this for our son for christmas and he loves it . he just turned 5 and has a bike with training wheels but it 's still too big for him . i do n't really like the idea of training wheels anyway so i started looking for something like this balancing bike . i saw a german one for $ 350 so i was thrilled to find this one for under $ 100 . it was so easy to assemble . i love that the seat height adjusts . my son rides it around the house and after just a few tries was able to coast down the hall on it with his feet off the floor . i think it 's a much better way to learn to ride a bike . the quality is good , the seat has a bit of padding , and i expect it will hold up well for my other child when she 's old enough to ride it in a couple more years . i gave it four stars instead of five because it 's put together with screws , it 's not fine craftsmanship . best buy in its category though
1	our three asian-american granddaughters got these today for christmas and they love them ! ignore the 5-star reviews that trash these cute little dolls , then try to steer you to ebay for another doll . these are the genuine article and kids love them , as they have for generations . our thirty-plus daughter-in-law still has her original cabbage patch doll , and she still loves it , just as her daughters loved theirs today
0	our family has the original leappad , and recently purchased a leappad plus writing . i must say that there is no comparison between the two products , and the original leappad system is by far superior . my kid love playing leappad , however the addition of a graphite pencil is a mess ! once the pages are written on , you can never get them completely clean , and also younger kids have a hard time erasing it all together . if we were to do it all over again , we would have purchased a second leappad system , and not bothered with the `` plus writing ''
1	my 9 month old son loves this toy ! it 's easily his favorite toy . he 'll gladly do tummy time hitting the piano keys and hitting the dial and characters . he has a great time making it go , and will now sit up and scoot the car a little . his other toys were good for a couple weeks at best , this one he only seems to be enjoying more the longer he plays with it . the music is not nearly as loud or as annoying as most toys and is actually a little fun . well worth the purchase price
1	we recently purchased this toy storage unit for our 22 month old son and we could n't be happier . it is sturdy and durable..a hard combination to find these days , looks great but most of all is very functional and user friendly ! ! it only requires 14 screws to assemble and it looks great . our son ca n't wait to get up and play , yelling toy box and jumping out of bed to grab a bin.i will purchase more of these for the different `` toy '' areas of our home and would certainly give it as a gift
0	i bought this shopping cart for my grandaughters age 22 and 23 months old . they love pushing it around without the baby seat , without the basket . in other words they are quite adept at taking it apart rolling around the frame . the doll is difficult to put in , the cardboard groceries were put away until they are older . the other groceries are fine , the pouring milk container is great as are the pretend veggies mac n cheese . they both put them in the containers . i am disappointed and was looking for a shopping cart that my own daughters had , that actually looks like a cart does n't disassemble so easily
0	we bought the watch for our 8-year-old granddaughter for christmas . it ran for about a month then stopped . i tried a new battery twice new but no luck . cute wristbands , nice concept but the watch itself does n't make the grade .
1	this mcqueen is different than the regular mcqueen - slightly darker maroon with a white swoosh on both sides - it is supposed to be the mcqueen that appears after the radiator springs team fixes him up ... my son was slightly disappointed though because the wheels were not white . i found out there was yet another mcqueen with the whitewall tires . go figure
1	my son got this toy for his first birthday . he 's now 18 months and still loves it ! when he first got it , he immediately began to dance to the music . you can press certain body parts on ernie and then he sings about them ( i.e . eyes , mouth , ears ) .my son can now identify his ears , mouth and eyes on himself . great toy
0	it has a lot of background noise so you have to set it high to hear the baby
1	both girls , ages 4 and 2 loved this
0	this is the worst game i have ever played . it was so bad that we did n't even finish . it came down to just guessing and could have gone on all night without a clear winner . this game sucks ! i would n't buy this game with somebody elses money , even if it were only $ 1
0	i bought this table set for my son because it was inexpensive and i did not want to spend a lot of money for something that was sure to get paint and glue all over it . from day one it was a big dissapointment . the chairs are very easily tipped over , he can not even sit on the chair if i am not holding it or the chair would fall over . the tabe is not made well as it is easy for things to slide off the surface . it seems to be slightly raised in the middle . i am now online shopping for a new one . so instead of paying 100 dollars the first time around , i am now spending the 30 dollars already spend and an additional 100 for the new tabl
0	the idea behind this toy is great ours has lived up to its durability claim . my husband did not complain about adding songs to it , so it could not have been too bad . batteries : this eats through them like crazy - and we used duracell . volume : the idea of volume control is good , but the highest volume is way too low . i ca n't even hear anything until i get it to the mid-setting . my 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn , but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones . we probably should not have bought this until next year , maybe fisher price will have improved it by then
0	our son received this toy for his first birthday . it has a lot of good features -- teaches colors , numbers , farm animals and their sounds , several songs . but the music is awful -- the singer is off-key on every single song ( either that , or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice ) . as someone who appreciates music , i can not tolerate listening to this , especially since there are far better toys out there . since our son already has 2 leapfrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy ( the learning table , which has much better quality music , and the fridge farm ) , we will be exchanging the vtech discovery nursery farm for a different toy
1	this is a great lego set . my 1 1/2 year old son loves them . he crashes the truck and caravan all the time and they never break . he really likes the bob and cat that come with it . these are also the right size to use with the bob click brick sets . this truck fits in to the parking thing with the talking click brick trucks
0	this product is a waste of time ! do n't bother . the handheld game is entertaining for my daughter , but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least ! once connected , we walked around the `` virtual world '' with nothing to do . it is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone . there are much better products out there for children that are similar , but easier to play with . i would suggest webkinz or neopets . these 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play , unlike the muichiz site ! good luck..
0	we just bought this for our 3 year old . i do not at all understand why it is labled for 5 and over ! ! cute game idea- but this was not well put together . first i about died when i saw the super cheap , barely cardboard gameboard ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it is a very small board , set up like a 4 piece puzzle , that i predict will barely stay together after a few plays . the jewelery , subpar . the crown and rings are ok , the rest very cheap and plain . but is serves it purpose just fine : ) . i give this low marks for educational and durablity . but the jewlery box and spinner are a nice durable ! ! if they put the same effort into the whole game it may be worth buying . my daughter did enjoy dressing up and playing a game together so that salvaged a star for the game .
0	the item arrived to us the week of christmas three weeks after we had ordered it . it arrived with several broken and several missing parts . amazon would not send us new parts , they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first . this was to be a christmas gift to my son , so that was not optional . had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would i would have had time to return it
1	my three year old sports nut just got this for his birthday . we have not had any problems , and he loves it . i can see his hitting improving already
1	this is a great toy that lets childrens ' minds grow . both , my 7 and 5 year old love to play with this toy . the magnetic base is so strong that you can build the metal peices ontop of each other to make a big sculpture . i would highly recommend this
1	i ca n't say enough about illustory ! my daughter is 6 and in kindergarten and loved to make stories on paper stapled together . so , santa brought her an illustory kit and we did it together as she ca n't write many of the words yet . so , she drew all the pictures and told me what she wanted to story to say . we got our book in the mail yesterday , and she was so thrilled to see her story bound like a real book ! the quality was great , and it even had the dedicaton page and an `` about the author '' page with her picture ( which i provided ) . we even ordered an extra copy for grandma with a dedication to her ! i highly reccomend this kit
1	we bought this for our daughter 's first birthday . she was immediately interested and so was her three-year-old brother . in addition , her five cousins ( ages 5-16 ) and their father ( 36 ) were also captivated . there are eleven gears in five colors that spin when the button is pushed . initially , she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them . she is fourteen months now and puts them back on . she presses the button to watch them spin . she has taken it to the sitter 's and the kids there have played with it all day . when we take it to the sitter 's , i put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when the toy is vertical . so far , it appears to be a toy that will grow with her as she and her brother play with it differently . we rotate toys , but i leave this one out continuously and i often find her playing with it quietly by herself . i have given it five stars because it offers a variety of ways to play ( the gears can even be stacked ) , is different from all other toys they have , appeals to a wide range of ages , grows with the child , does not use up batteries ( we are still on the first set ) , and seems very durable . i recommend this toy
1	we are loving this set ! very cool dragons , a fun environment for characters to explore and fight in . extra fun from several moving features - rasing/lowering cauldron , tramcar on sloped tracks , erupting mountain top , opening dragon mouth , flapping dragon wings , firing cannon . a little challenging to build , but the instructions are fairly clear . assembly took an adult about 3 relaxed hours . a few sections come apart after some play but they are pretty easy to put back together . so far no pieces have broken . most important , this is a lot of fun to play with . over the past two days , our set has been getting non-stop play from a 9 year old boy and 6 year old girl . a great toy for two kids to play with together , and the boy says a single child could also spend hours happily playing by himself . we would n't have paid the full retail price for this , but at $ 35 ( amazon discounted price ) , i think this is appropriate value .
1	i just found this car at toysrus for $ 3.49 ; plus others in this series . i came online to amazon to see if i could find characters not available at the store and i was blown away by these prices -- $ 29.99 ? ? ? ? you 've got to be kidding me ! i bought the toy cars for my five year old son to play with -- the only reason i can see toys being priced this high is they must be trying to catch collectors . i 'm glad i could find what i did at a local store ; i definitely would not pay these high prices ... i would have been very happy to buy others in the series from amazon , but at these prices i am definitely not going to !
0	we purchased this for our daughter as a christmas gift . what a nightmare . first of all , the scissors it came with ... well let 's just say my teeth cut better . this scissor is so dull we 'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it . it cuts nothing . this sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material , so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something . it 's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle . the stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch . there is no bobbin , so there 's nothing to hold your stitch together . we wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter 's dolls ... wishful thinking ! the minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out , the stitches come apart and you have nothing . my daughter just walked away . we ca n't believe singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic .
1	really nice toy . but i do n't understand why there are only 3 knobs on the grill but there are 4 burners ... i think this might confuse some of our future fast food employees ... .
1	my son received this as a christmas gift and loves it . took a little bit for him to understand how to work it . only down fall is that it wo n't run on carpet . requires hard floor or table to sit on . goes really fast
1	this costume kit was a great deal for the price . my son loves it
1	webkinz hippo arrived in an exceptable time frame and in good condition . i will definitely order others
1	very cute and soft . little girl loves it and goes on line to the web site to play with her virtual pet . lots of fun
0	very fun i love it is like a dream in a book the wings do fall of but not often . what i say is yes get it
1	this toy is so cool ! i use it all the time with my friend erica.you could text message each other and it even takes pictures .my parents bought it for me at christmas . they were happy because they did not have to pay a phone bill or for minutes ! this toy is so cool ! now i do not have to beg my parents for a real cell phone ! ! ! i highly recomend for any one who is reading this to get this toy !
0	the handle falls off easily so its not good for a young toddler learning to walk.the seat is very wide so unless your [ small kid ] has legs as long as a [ grown up kid ] its not going to be comfortable . the wideness does help with the balance of it for a child that would be pushing it but the handle popping off kind of defeats that purpose
1	we originally bought this game at the chiricahua national monument in arizona for our kids ( 8 and 10 years old at the time ) and they loved it . we love that it 's monopoly , but one that creates interest in visiting our national parks .
0	the pixel chix 2 story house was suppose to intertwine with other pixel chix products - i had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa - did not work - returned this item
1	our 3 children have had hours of fun with this toy during the 2+ years we 've had it in our home . true , the food is long gone ( cardboard boxes - toddlers - no surprise there ) . we 've also needed lash the front piece on with some string ( again , it 's not constructed to be a bumper car but toddlers do n't often keep their play inside the box ) . the simple design means that when they twist it beyond reason , it 's flexible enough for me to pop it back into alignment . it 's small enough to be comfortable for the 2 year old to push ( for hours ) , and close enough to the real thing to remain interesting for a 5-6 year old . it 's gender neutral , forgiving enough to go down a flight of stairs ( repeatedly ) without breaking , light enough to not squish whatever 's at the bottom ... . and sometimes they do even use it to play grocery
1	yesterday we where buying the christmass presents , when i saw there was the big air towel at 40 bucks , so i said to my mother if i could buy so she said yes , when i got home i began building it , after 6 hours i finished it . and when i tried everything was going all right , so it was n't that difficult
0	i agree with a previous review , this ball pit will not stay inflated ! my kids had barely played with it and it started tearing and getting small , unrepairable holes in it . this is also a very small ball pit . it is too small for two kids to easily play in it and not bang heads . we had purchased a little peoples ball pit train years ago for my older daughter and it held up for years . this was a very disappointing purchase
1	i bought this play tent for my 15-month old daughter for christmas . she loves going through the curtain entrances and plays peek a boo through the little window . she 's a little rough on the door , not realizing the door opens outward . but she 's a little young still to understand the full extent of the play tent . all in all , worth the money
0	last summer we bought two of these cruisers and both of them broke after only one month of normal use . the water squirt function quit working after only a week . my kids loved them , but for the price these cruisers are , they need to be built to last
0	who cares what the commercail says . it is not an widescreen . man , a 3 inch screen ? great , my psp screen is bigger than your 's tiger electron-poop . the discs are only 30 minutes long ? the discs for the psp is an half gigabite . do not buy this waste
1	i bought my girls , ages 7 and 4 , this product earlier this spring . it was easy to assemble , but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process . it has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use . when our play group meets here , the kids line up to have a turn , over and over again . i would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands . a very durable product and a fun physical activity
1	star wars trivial pursuit saga edition ( 2005 . ) introduction : despite having been around since the middle of the seventies , the star wars series has never declined in its popularity . george lucas created a science fiction phenomenon that has stood the test of time , and then some . and needless to say , many games have been based on the series - video games , role-playing games , and no shortage of board games have been adapted for the star wars universe . in 1998 , star wars trivial pursuit was released . being a die-hard fan of the series , it was by far my favorite ( non video game ) star wars game ever . unfortunately , it outdated fast , due to the fact that it did n't cover the prequel trilogy it was immediately followed by . but in 2005 , seven years and three star wars episodes later , a new version of the game has hit store shelves ! read on for my review of the new version of star wars trivial pursuit . overview : quite honestly , who does n't know what trivial pursuit is ? well , for those of you who have been living under a rock all your life , here 's the concept behind the game . players alternate rolling a die and moving their game token across a wheel-shaped board . there are six different-colored spaces . each color represents a different category . the player is then asked a question of that category . if he or she gets it right , he or she goes again . if he or she misses it , it 's the next player 's turn . at six spots on the board are wedge spaces . the objective of the game is to gain a wedge in all six colors and return to the central hub of the wheel , and answer a game-winning question . some changes for this edition of the game are , rather obviously , the questions and overall game design being star wars based , and two dvds , which contain the wedge and game-winning questions . a new concept to the game includes a player being able to `` steal '' if another player is unable to answer the wedge question , in the last few seconds of time . essentially , the game play stays play to the classic stylings of trivial pursuit , but gives it a star wars overhaul . in other words , this game is exactly what it says it is . review : the original star wars trivial pursuit was , without question , my favorite star wars game of all time that was n't a video game . this new version is a massive improvement over the old version . for starters , the new version covers the entire star wars film saga . the classic galactic civil war trilogy ( episodes iv , v and vi ) and the prequel clone wars trilogy ( episodes i , ii , and iii ) all get equal emphasis . if you hated the original version for not covering the prequel trilogy , that problem has , obviously , been corrected , and in a major way . the dvds also add a nice new twist to the game . it 's good to finally have a method of setting the wedge questions apart from regular questions . and , of course , you can do anywhere from two to four players or teams . i do have a few minor complaints , though . first of all is the selection of the tokens of characters you can play as . the original version had luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , and darth vader . in other words , a nice assortment of main characters . the new version has luke skywalker , darth vader , obi-wan kenobi , and yoda . in other words , only jedi characters . this is strictly a cosmetic flaw , but still , i think they could have picked a better assortment of characters than those four . another complaint is the inclusion of a die . for those of you who never played the original version of the game , it included an electronic r2d2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces to move when you tapped its head , via an lcd screen . i liked that better than rolling a die because it helped to give the game a unique star wars feel that playing with a die just does n't have . another problem is the price of the game - i 've seen it everywhere from $ 45 to $ 60 ! even at the lowest msrp , it 's still a rip off . one of the biggest problems is one of the most obvious - if you 're not a die-hard star wars fan , you will not get very far in this game . my last and biggest complaint is with the questions themselves - like the original game , they are horribly imbalanced . some questions are so simple , a casual fan could answer them easily . some are so difficult , even die-hards will have trouble with them . this brings me to my complaint about the dvd questions . not only are these questions really no more difficult than the card questions , but as time ticks down , the questions become easier ! this makes it ridiculously easy for another player to `` steal '' the wedge if the question receiver is unable to answer . if i were designing the game , i 'd straighten up these flaws . but i 'm not , and overall , i am very satisfied with it . edition notes : this game is a fairly recent release , and it remains readily available at most major stores that sell board-style games and movie merchandise . if you want the game , it should n't be too hard - just be ready to pay a fairly high price for it . overall : despite some minor issues , this new version of star wars trivial pursuit is a leaps-and-bounds improvement over the original game . if you 're a huge fan of the series who thinks your knowledge of the series is supreme , do n't hesitate to buy this game . there have been many star wars trivia games/books/etc . over the years , but star wars trivial pursuit is the ultimate star wars trivia experience . no fan should pass this game up
1	i recently bought this read with me dvd system after much hesitation from other reviews . it was on sale at toy r ' us for $ 18 so i decided that i would go ahead and try it . i took the advice of one of the reviewers and waited until my daughter went to bed to program it . to be honest , it took me longer to get it out of the package than to program it . the system was programmed in less than 5 minutes and i have a pioneer dvd player that is over 5 years old . the only thing i would suggest besides waiting until you child is asleep is not to lay the dvd control perfectly flat or it will be lower than the eye on the read with me dvd system . my daughter absolutely loved it ! the reason i gave it 4 out of 5 is because wish they had a few more dvd available in stores .
0	my 7 year old son got it for christmas . he was really excited . it is definitely a neat toy . the whole family was into it . however , it only lasted one day . it would no longer charge and i am just going to take it back because i am in no position waste $ 20.00 just for one day
0	if you run a spellcaster deck , buy the good cards individually because in my opinion , i rarely get good cards out of this booster
0	this looks like such a great toy , and the packaging is really impressive , but do n't be fooled like we were . i assumed that by paying close to 25 dollars it would be somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-i do n't expect much from plastic toys ... but this is really really bad . you might also think that paying that much would give you things like closable doors ... you know , 99 cent matchbox cars ' doors stay closed , but the space shuttle 's doors don't-which limit it 's `` fun '' factor . the `` movable arm '' is just a free floating plastic stick that simply is stuck into a hole..it does n't even stay in . the `` launch pad '' and the fuel tank/boosters are down right horrible . they do n't connect to the shuttle , which was disapointed all of us , especially my son . and it is so cheaply made , i really ca n't believe that it was n't bought from the dollar store . my son was so excited for this set . but after playing with it for just a few minutes he has n't gotten it out again . i would definately not recommend this
0	i bought it for my 1 and half son . he likes it . but seveal days after he had it , it broken . i dont know why , just no music . he doesnt like it any more
0	my children have loved playing in this tent . i like it also because it is not huge and does n't take up a lot of room , but it is also not made out of very durable material . i picked it up to move it out of the way and it ripped . it is easy to pop-up and down , just will probably not have a very long lifetime with kid 's play
1	wow ! this is an excellent deck that lets you automatically get the harpie lady cards , and as well as a monster card based on one of the characters from legend of the mystical ninja
0	this car pictured could be a base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these are going for 100.00 and less on the web . if you havent noticed the differences in the packaging it wouldnt suprise me . lots of people dont notice . heres the differences below ... on these 5 cars there is two versions of each driver ( 5 different drivers ) that were made . first versions or base version and second versions or `` added features '' version . the first versions have no `` added features '' stickers and you can not race any two ( or more ) cars of the 5 different drivers ' cars at the same time ! dale sr. and dale jr. , jeff gordon , jimmie johnson and tony stewart cars of the first versions ( no added features ) can not race together ! transmitter frequencys can not be changed . speed and steering are straight function . ( no varilable anything ) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight . speed is either it goes full on or it doesnt . same for reverse gear . again , each of the 5 different drivers ' cars made are two different versions of the same car one has more features than the other . updated or `` added features '' versions have `` added features '' stickers . those `` added features '' are ... digital proportional steering ( variable steering ) , which means you can turn the transmitter wheel slightly and the car turns a little . turn the transmitter wheel alot and the car turns alot . variable speed control this means you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little , pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off ! this also works for reverse gears as well now if this isnt cool enough ... each `` added features '' car has different frequencies for different drivers ' car . the transmitters for the cars are different as well . `` added features '' version transmitter has two `` trim '' adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the frequency chip on the side of the remote than can be changed , and can also be changed on the chassis of the car . so if you own 2 of the tony stewart cars , you would have to have a frequency pack to race them at the same time . now , two or more different drivers ' cars can race together ( or five people can race 5 different cars ) . no two alike cars can race together unless you have the `` frequency of another car and transmitter '' to change it , or a `` frequency pack '' from team up inc. all 5 frequency chips do not come with the car in the box , off the shelf . this `` frequency pack '' is sold seperately ! you can also purchase tires , suspension parts and body hold down clips , fully painted and ready to use new spare or other drivers ' teams bodies , extra rechargeable battery packs seperately ! i have done lots of research on these cars and should you have any questions please ask ... nascarnbroncosfans @ msn.co
0	this item is cheap and i do n't mean the price . it will not stay together . the plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone . the arched bars are not bent enough causing one side to pop up off the floor . i tried bending them myself , but they always return to their original shape . pay the extra money and get a better mat
0	compared with the sound sensation blocks i bought together to my 3-month babies , this product is almost ignored by them .
0	i bought leappad plus writing on impulse at the store , wanting to help my son with writing , phonics , etc . he used it a few times , but i almost have to beg for him to use it ... and that 's sad . i wish i would have gotten the original leappad or perhaps even the leapster . for one thing , the book does n't recognize all pencil movements . a child could make an incorrect number or letter , and it does n't seem that the leappad would recognize it . also , the child has to keep erasing over and over , providing limited usage . not only that , there are only a few books published with leappad writing in mind , and the exercises are repetitive ( e.g . writing the number 6 ten times ) . i 've bought quite a few leappad books and quantum pad books for my son , and he is just not interested after initial use . i 'm sure he 's learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and such , but i think he learns more from workbooks bought at a bookstore or a department store -- and they 're cheaper ! not only that leappad books are very short ... much shorter than workbooks you can buy . considering that leappad books are usually around $ 15 a pop -- and that amazon does n't carry/list them all and there is a very limited selection in stuff mart-type stores ( at least , that 's the case in my geographical area ) -- you may want to re-consider investing in the leappad system .
0	i am very disappointed in the construction of this toy . the picture on the website and the picture on the box made it look like it was made of a more durable material . it was made mostly of styrofoam and cost way too much for what it 's made of . i have no doubt that this toy will not survive until next christmas . i would have sent it back if it had not been from `` santa '' .
1	the kit was great i thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors ! this toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies , put magginets on them or just play with them ! this toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break.if you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one
0	when this toy is turned on it seriously sounds like an air-raid siren is going off . i ca n't use my usual trick of putting tape over the speaker because you need to be able to hear the instructions to play the games . also , the counting/shape game is confusing . there is a row of shapes with numbers on them , and the game asks the child to , for example , find 3 rectangles . it 's trying to get the child to press the rectangle shape three times , but the rectangle shape is marked with the number 8 . there 's a circle marked with the number 3 . the only reason i 'm not giving this one star is because my son enjoys playing the `` repeat the tone '' and `` count the villians '' games . i 'm not sure how much longer the adults in the house can handle the siren noise , though , i may try to hide this and get him a leapfrog toy instead
0	the remote worked only for 2 days . my daughter loves the look of it so i am not able to dispose it off . its a total waste of money . i wish i had read the reviews before buying it since lot of people seem to have the same problem with the remote .
1	this figure is one of the best in the marvel legends series . i have over forty of the marvel legends figures and this is the tallest . the hair on his body looks real and his joints are n't to tight , but not to lose either their just right . i could n't wait for them to release more exiles members like noctourne , blink , morph , mimic . i was n't very happy to see the marvel legends series coming to an end with the seperation of marvel from toy biz the last series are going to be realeased later this year . i 'm glad to see psylocke falcon before the series end , but what about the wildly popular she hulk . they 've got the loser sabertooth from the exiles coming out , but not she hulk . if you 're going to bring an exiles to the series at least bring characters we like . noctourne , morph , blink , mimic ! ! ! !
0	the idea behind this toy was a cute one , but it stops there . within five minutes of playing with this toy , it broke . the dog halter broke off the wire leash and could not be repaired . the whole thing ended up in the trash on christmas day !
0	i never imagined i was going to be such a bad experience , when you start the game is almost lost for the ones that chosen the light side . then the game is complicated and it is not balanced , so everybody will choose the `` dark side '' because they have advantages . dont waste you money buying this game , better buy the normal risk , acquire , or axes and allie
0	the hide n seek care bear really was n't all it was made out to be . my kids played with it , with my husband , on christmas , and they all gave up after 5 minutes . it was giving out wrong directions , and just was n't really a good substitute for a game of hide and seek . so my girls forgot about the remote control and play with the doll like it 's an ordinary stuffed animal -- an rather expensive stuffed animal
0	bought this and several other minimates for by son 's birthday . as we are huge lego fans , i thought this would be a great compliment . the `` lego-like '' bricks are ill fitted , either constantly coming undone or never being able to fit together at all . this caused great frustration and unhappiness . we finally had to hide the entire lot from my son too keep him from breaking down everytime he or another family member tried to put the batcave or any of the vehicles together . do not buy . i would like a full refund and an apology from amazon for carrying such an afwul quaility toy , and from the creator of the minimates . ugh
0	this toy is the most stupidest thing i have ever had . the only reason why i gave it a one is because you could n't give it a zero . first of all this thing beeps every five seconds . i swear even when im sleeping this thing beeps . it ws n't always like that when i got it i would bring it to school then everyone started getting one even kindergarners had one then the princble banned them because one third grader lost hers . during class kids would ask me do you want to connect ? im just saying this is a toy for little ones . this toy can also get repetative i mean its a baby then it gets a tooth ache toddler teen adult old person . so parents if your thining about buying this toy for your children dont because in about a month and a half they would probably stop using it . so dont buy it
0	my 3 year old daughter and i have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand . the design is nice , it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice . however , after using it twice , the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted . this makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place . it makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving . my daughter was frustrated . i eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child . i do n't recommend this wand
1	my son loves these ! they arrived in perfect condition . love that they are machine washable
0	my daughter got this for christmas and it only says , `` know what goes good with everything ? ripped pants ! '' then he sings , `` you wo n't end up like the fool who ripped his pants . '' and then says , `` this is so embarrassing ! '' my daughter dropped the toy once and it said a different phrase but we ca n't get it to do it again . it seems like it 's stuck in the `` demo '' mode and we ca n't figure out how to make it work . i called fisher price and due to unsually high call volume they disconnect you after telling you to call back another time , probably due to the fact that every parent who 's child recieved this toy is calling to complain .
1	these books have all been wonderful tools that my son has not only enjoyed very much , but they 've helped him make needed improvements with many academic skills . this on encourages reading and it 's another great example of a fantastic and useful interactive product
0	my son 's best friend got one of those for christmas and we went to the lake to test it against my son 's regular rc boat . the hovercraft was very slow and not quite that maneuverable . it hovered ok on water , but could n't handle sand or concrete . the `` skirt '' slipped out of its track a couple times ( despite our being careful fitting it as best as we could ) , filling with water - the foam inside it did n't prevent the boat from being swamped by the smallest wave ( even in good shape it could n't handle waves like the other boat . ) the thin skirt finally ripped and the boat is pretty much unusable now . big disapointment . it was somewhat fun while it worked , the concept was intriguing for the gearhead boys , but once the novelty wore off the regular boat was a lot more exciting and all the kids prefered taking turns running that one .
1	classic , durable , fun , educational -- for kids of all ages , including me
0	like all other sy - it stops working after a few uses and even when it did work the bubbles were not a plenty . people seem content on buying again after it breaks , but it would be nice for it to have some durability . it is better than blowing the bubbles yoursel
0	this kit is very poorly detailed , and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close . there 's a much better model of an x-wing out there . do a web search for a company called `` fine molds '' ... it 's a japanese company that makes a finely-detailed 1/72 scale x-wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures , including parts to build different ships from the original film 's death star battle , including standing seated pilot figures different droid types . it 's a bit more expensive than this kit , but you get what you pay for .
1	this is a great barney musical songbook , and can also be used as a play piano . it 's great that it has an auto turn off , after non-use . however , if it is turned off , and something touches it , it automatically turns on by itself . many times , after the kids went to bed , and we happen to put something on top of the barney sing 'n play songbook , it turns on by itself . because the songbook does not have a physical turn off switch , and something touches it , barney will start talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep . just wish it has an on/off switch , so it will not be turned on accidentally . otherwise , my 3 year old loves it
0	this product is terrible . the very essence of su doku is logic reasoning . this product leaves everything to guesswork . i returned it , ate the postage , was happy to be rid of it ! i then downloaded shareware from the palm store to my palm pilot for $ 10 . could n't be happier
0	the only thing `` deluxe '' about this addition is the glossy foil cover of the box , which is designed to make you think you are getting something special by paying more money . nothing could be further from the truth . this edition screams `` cheap '' from the second the lid comes off . let 's go thru the hype above and set the record straight on all the `` deluxe '' features : the board is a quad-fold affair , redesigned presumably to allow a smaller , less expensive box . it has much less rigidity than the single-fold board of the `` classic '' version . when it is left out for an extended period of time , especially overnite , the ends of the board curl up and refuses to lay flat . the houses and hotels are completely featureless , just small blocks of wood . they looked to be dipped in some type of vegetable dye rather than painted . this is probably an attempt to eek out a few extra cents of corporate profit . the `` bankers tray '' and `` property wheel '' are flimsy plastic jokes . neither would last under play by children much more than a few games . this edition is a sad legacy to a great game , and the cheapness of the set detracts from the joy of play . for the additional cost , all you are really getting is the fancy foil cover and one extra play token , plus a board that curls up at the edges : whoopee ! my advice : save the extra money and buy the `` classic '' version .
1	my 3 year old daughter got this puzzle for christmas and she simply adores it . this is her fourth melissa doug puzzle and i have to say she loves them all . as soon as she is done with one she puts it away and runs for another one . keep making wonderful puzzles melissa doug !
0	do n't be deceived by the box : dread pirate looks like a really cool game with exceptionally made components , but it is dreadfully boring to play . the game is slow , tedious , and completely luck based , and simply no fun to play . you have been warned
1	my kids ( 4.5 and 1 ) love this car . the sounds it makes are great . they take turns riding on it and the other one pushing . it is quite durable and they play with it all the time . only negative is that some of the stickers peeled off . overall , it 's a great toy and the kids play with it every day
1	this is a great toy , i play with it all the time and it still works
0	i should have paid attention to the reviewer who stated this doll is a `` piece of junk '' and the only good thing is how the doll is dressed ! being optimistic , after the first purchase of the doll proved to be disappointing ( she laughs adorably ; she makes the sucking noise ; she makes a contented sound , which becomes 'stuck ' and the mechanism on her back must be turned off ; she does not kick her legs ; she does not close her eyes when rocked ) i purchased a second doll and this doll was less functional than the first one . the second doll cries continually . she does close her eyes and that 's it ! i returned the second one and kept the first one because she is more functional . do n't waste your dollars on this one
0	this bike may be cute , but it tips over too easily . my daughter was on it for 10 minutes and she tipped over several times , then would not go on it . i returned it to the store , after reading on this site that it is obviously a common problem with this bike .
0	bought this for my 3 year old daughter who really uses it a lot daily . the level of edutainment is excellent for her age and she learns a lot from it . my only sore point with it is the lack of strength of the perforated part of the pages ( for the spiral binding ) . the pages tend to be separated there so i think it will be a good idea to strenghten the perforated part of the book or to use some other form of binding that will not decrease the overall strength
1	this playset is great - my son loves it . you do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very easy to fall off . my only complaint was puting it together . the instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures . the parts are hard to tell apart ( the color-coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions ) and the pieces are hard to handle . give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help . also , a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic
0	do not buy at this price . ridiculous ! ! ! just bought this car on ebay for 8.99 . and bought another very rare one ( `` mr the king '' ) for $ 10.00 . these sellers are nuts !
1	although my granddaughter is in love with the webkinz , i was upset at the fact ... after just receiving it , the glitter string around the unicorn 's neck came apart from the unicorn . still my granddaughter loves it
1	this is a well thought of game . a game where the players play along with the dvd as the gatemaster gives you commands , rewards , or punishiments while they are playing the game . players can also watch the rules and the setup instructions on the dvd . six keys of six different types will be laid out on some of the spaces , as your goal is to get one of each type and rush to the center before 49 minutes is up . if neither player wins in 49 minutes , the gate master has defeated you . in the beginning you write down your fears and reveal them at the end which is always fun . the board has six territories . each character owns a territory which has a set of the same keys . you can pick up a key by landing on the key space , having a card telling you to , gate master telling you to , or winning a duel . a duel is when you land on a battle space and 2 players wager a key for a dice roll to see who gets both . there are two types of cards ... time and fate . land on a skull head and get a fate card which allows you to do something in a certain situation . a time card you get if you land on a clock . a time card allows you to do something if you play it in the exact second it tells you to . sometimes the gate master will give you the power to banish someone . when there is reward , there is also punisment . if you land on the cursed key , you have to pick it up and whenever you have it , you can not win . if you are landed into a black hole , you can not participate until you are freed . also , you can lose keys . during the game the gate master says `` stop ! '' frequently and the players will have to lisen to what he says or be punished . all in all , it is one of the best games out there and well worth the money .
1	this was a christmas gift , however i can rate it on the base that i own one just like it . this is good for a lifetime of fun
0	my daughter has an earlier version that the one shown so it is possible they have addressed some of these issues : 1 ) most games have a 1 minute time out which is really frustrating for my kids 2 ) `` oh that 's not so good '' - if i hear barbie say that one more time i may just throw this thing out the nearest window . my daughter will get a score in a game she feels really good about and barbie says , `` oh that 's not so good , but you 'll be better with a bit more practice '' this has broken my daughter down into tears more than once . 3 ) there are no parental controls . i wanted to turn off or lengthen the timer . i expected those sorts of features from oregon scientific . right now the most fun thing my kids do with it is play the flower fun game ( like hangman ) and type in `` icup '' if you are looking at a newer version of this i would strongly recommend playing with a demo for a few minutes to check it out
1	i purchased this from amazon , having only seen it in photographs . based on the online images i expected the top to be opaque pink , and the bottom part to be see-thru pink , so i could see what was inside . when it arrived the top was indeed the exact color as on amazon , but the bottom was a pearlized lighter opaque pink . i do n't have any problem with this , in fact i may even like it better , but it was just unexpected . overall the case is great . just as advertised it will hold 15 dolls in a standing position , with plenty of space in the 2 compartments in the lid for all sorts of shoes and accessories . the doors on top are difficult to open , and i know i will have to help my 4 year old with it at first , until they `` soften '' up a bit , but at least they wo n't be flying open , spewing mini plastic platform shoes everywhere . as one previous reviewer noted , there is a larger open space in the main compartment that is n't great for holding a lot . i plan on using either a ziploc bag in that space to maximize it , or attaching a ( pink ! ? ! ) piece of cardboard or thin plastic to extend the height of it . we 'll then be able to fit massive amounts of clothes in there ! my cart does say `` barbie '' on the lid , but the markings are discrete , and tastefully done . overall , i like this cart . it 's probably the best storage device for barbie that i 've seen . it 's cute , fairly well-made and will hold a ton . i did n't give it 5 stars because of the issue with the interior storage , the handle seems a bit flimsy , the wheels are not great for carpet , and it 's a bit pricey
1	my 8-year old wanted a pirate ship for christmas , which was a dilemma because all i could find were ships for toddlers or lego-related ships . this one is fully assembled ( phew ! ) and when he opened the box , he jumped for joy . the 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could appreciate . the cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and unloads treasures . my son found enough small removable parts on the ship ( a parrot , tools , anchor , lamps ) to keep him occupied for hours . the whole ship is hard or molded plastic , including the sails . i 'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future battles . i 'm very happy with this ship , but i would n't recommend it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects
1	this elmo item is pretty cool . if ur child is an elmo fan then im sure you know how annoying these elmo doll/ toys can be.. oh jeez the voice is so loud and it echoes. ! ! ! however this one is far less annoying than the rest because he hums when you plug his mouth -- im srry i meant ta say when you give him his pacifier ( lol ) -- you just hear an adorable hum sound . overall this is a cool gift . theres is an off button i only wish there was a lower volume button for early morning play
0	i bought this for my daughter 's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of chicco happy garden products . my daughter loves the little tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter . the eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment . she would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest . now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months , it has been completely shoved aside . it just does n't rock much . i ca n't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it . the eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring . i would stick to the little tikes set .
0	it sucked because i couldnt figure out the screen it is really big so you cant relly hide it any where and you cant drop it because it will break really easily trust me i kno
0	i consider myself a very tolerable and patient parent when it come to toys with noise , however ; this phone is way too loud for baby/toddler . it actually startles my 15 month old and makes him cry because it is so loud . plus , it is powered by the wonderful button batteries that do n't last . this was given as a gift , glad i did n't spend my money on it . be aware that this phone is annoying , really serves no purpose and is too loud for babies ears
1	my son is 11 and loved this . he was very proud when he built it by himself . it is very detailed and has movable parts so that you can also play with it ( gently of course ) . this is the type of piece that is great all by itself without getting all the other pieces in the series . it is also a classic piece in that it does n't have a cartoon or charter theme
0	man this game sucks . i love snl , but the questions here are so trivial . i was looking forward to getting this for christmas and was very excited when i opened it . it all went downhill from there . i think the pieces are a good idea , but they 're ugly . the dvd clues are dumb and ineffective . i was playing with my dad ( who is legally blind ) . he could n't read the questions on the tv . i think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated . overall , the game sucked , the questions were silly and it was n't fun at all ! as an aside , i noticed that there are no african americans on the box or the board . one could argue that eddie murphy or chris rock were more successful snl stars than , say , cheri oteri . whatever . game sucks . costs too much . stay away
1	i give this leap pad book 3 stars for fun because my children were not interested enough to even look at all the pages.they played with it a lot , but did not get even half way through , maybe that just means it is full of fun stuff to do , but since my kids have not gone back to it , i feel it does not hold their interest quite enough . educational , 4 stars because some of it seemed a bit simple , like the space page . 5 stars for durability because it is no more and no less durable then regular leap pad books . dont like the eraseable pen though . must cover it each and every time , even between questions . if it 's off more then 5 seconds , it dries out.i peronally did not find it very easy to keep picking up and putting down pens . i tried using a pen in each hand , and it dried out , so i had to keep putting down the regular `` pen '' to cover up the eraseable pen . pretty annoying
0	i hate this doll ! she is difficult to program , eats batteries and the tags which must be plugged into her body do not like to stay attached . within a week her hair was a matted mess , it took me an hour to brush out the tangles and is now braided . i would not recommend this doll to anyone . with all the frustration this doll has caused i would love to turn it into a shooting target
1	my 7-year-old daughter loves this tub of k'nex , and has now foresworn her legos . 400 pieces does not go as far as you might expect , however ; you may find yourself shopping for an expansion set soon . lego : * you can build houses * simple stacking approach * upgrade to technics for 3d building * those adorable little lego people * wider variety of pieces and sets k'nex : * 3-dimensional construction * more complicated trigonometric approach * you can build bridges * everything can rotate and i saw a k'nex set that lets you join lego and k'nex ..
1	the gizmo doll is very realistic . it looks just like the one in the movie . the doll 's ears are about 11 inches across and the doll is about 8 inches tall . i bet your going to really like this plush gizmo doll , my son treats him like a member of the family . thank you for reading
0	my daughter bought this with birthday money and it jammed on the first day she played with it . we ca n't get the sticker roll out and she is very disappointed . do n't bother with this toy . buy a better one made for scrapbooking . the look on my daughter 's face when this broke was heart-breaking
0	my daughter was very excited to receive this for christmas , until she tried to change the thread that came with the machine . it literally would not work anymore . i tried everything . maybe it 's defective ... ..but from other reviews i read , i think it 's just a really bad attempt at a great idea . too bad ... .she is very disappointed ... .
1	this is the greatest thing , i was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn . not only has it lived up to my 3 year old , but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play , it has not torn . it sparks great imagination . all her friends go to school now , this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also . and best of all , we can store it anywhere when we are done , she has even learned to close it up and put it away . i highly recommend this bus to all ! !
0	i had a problem with brietta a day after i bought her . i was combing her hair , and suddenly her head broke ! the part of her head that has hair seperated from her forehead , and there is no way to fix her . so she is stuck with a crack in her skull . i 'm very upset about this . other than that , i adore my brietta doll . she has long strawberry blond hair that curls at the end in a messy way , so i cut the hair shorter to get rid of the messy curls . her face has a gorgeous expression , which looks so friendly to me . her gown is light pink with a real overskirt and long sleeves , and she has pink shoes that actually stay on ! i 'm just sad that she broke , but i still love her nonetheless
0	the bar is nice , and i suppose the mat will come in handy for reviewing the basic positions . but the dvd ... it 's just awful . the music is painfully bad . seriously , what dp little girls dressed like fruit have to do with ballet ? and the `` host '' is a confusing choice : her accent is distracting , and it 's made even worse by the fact that she 's talking around braces . the two little girls who help her do n't look much happier . in fact , the one on the left looks like someone told her to smile or else . trying to keep up with the nominally enducational dvd is harder than you might think , as the mat has two sides and you have to flip it over mid-stream , only you get no warning and no time to do it . and the positions are introduced too quickly and with no discussion ; they 're just lyrics to the annoying song . our daughter got this for her 3rd birthday , and she actually looked at me the first time we watched it and said , `` i want the fruit to go away . '' i had to laugh out loud and tell her i did too ! overall , i 'm sorry her grandparents spent $ 15 on this . total disappointment
1	t.j. is a great learning tool for children . all the stories have been wonderful lessons for children as well as helping them to read
0	we bought this thinking the suctions would keep the darn thing on - boy were we wrong ! the suction cups are so weak that my cat jumped onto the toilet seat and knocked it over . save your money
0	my son was excited to get this for christmas . after we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed . the arrows launcher never held the arrows . as soon as you tried to load them they would fly out . the shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use . he pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it 's gathering dust in our closet .
1	i got this toy for my nephew and i know he will get alot of good years out of it .
1	i like bratz twiins , and i love tess and nona.i like nona very much.i love her clothes.i also like tess.i think she is very cool ! i might include these cool bratz twiins on my wish list . sara siblini ! ! ! my scene lover ! ! ! bratz lover ! ! ! *forever
1	well , i got this ahwile ago i got this toy and i was very excited . i made the blanket but it was a hassel . the glue did n't work , and the instuctions are a bit ocnfusing , but it is fun when your done ! !
0	we were unfortunately dissappointed with our purchase . we loved that it showed rubber stoppers for saftey and for our hard wood floors ~ they did n't come with it . further , melissa and doug puzzles do n't fit .
1	the doll is wonderful and my granddaughter thinks it is her best birthday gift . i also want to especially compliment and thank amazon for their excellent handling of this purchase . i made a mistake when ordering and they very promptly helped me to correct it . i look forward to doing business with amazon in the future
1	i have been having such a good time with this marshmellow shooter ! i recommend it to anyone . plus you can aim at someone and they can eat what the ammo ! thinking of giving these to me employees as christmas gifts !
0	this pirate chest is a total rip off . the chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal . when i ordered it as a gift for someone , they sent me someone else 's order ... .then refused to let me return my item for a refund when i finally received it . the company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all .
0	i bought this for my boyfriend as a present . we both love the tv show and thought the game would be as exciting ( without the live crowd , of course ) . but the game moves slow , no models - only picking case numbers . you can compete against one another , but its not really exciting . maybe you should try the board game version - it ca n't be any worse .
1	this is a must-have item if you want to add the clock tower to your set . it also works well with the other `` elevation '' sets , particularly mile high mountain . the set includes the following : 4 ramps ( these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together ) 2 curves 2 short straights 2 guard rails 2 end ramps 8 arches ( 2 supports and 1 crosspiece each ) the crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned . the screws are a little tough but never need to be removed . the set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again ( my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up , around and racing back down ) . you can also make two single-level bridges , a single level bridge and a ramp down from mile high mountain , or many other setups . this set literally adds a new dimension to a geotrax set . lots of fun . the short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past . definitely fun .
0	my son loved the toy and could n't wait to get it opened , but the problem came when we tried to close it back up . the treasuer box would not close back up easily . i had to work at it very hard , my son who is 7 could not close it by himself . he got pretty frustrated
1	i had to buy my 4 year old a new leap pad after his old one wore out . he is currently obsessed with spiderman so i grabbed this one . i did n't realize it came with the spiderman book i was going to buy him soon anyway ( saved me $ 15 ) ! so far the new leap pad and spiderman book have been a huge hit !
0	this puzzle ( also known as rubik 's revenge ) is good fun - and because it has another layer of movement , it is much more likely to fall apart than the 3x3x3 cube . however , the puzzle of reassembly is also quite fun - and requires no force ! a clue to reassembly - make sure that the last two pieces are the same colour edge pieces - and they will ( very gently ) snap into place . a second clue : only the centre pieces ( four flats pieces on each side ) fit into the grooves of the ball - be gentle , and your cube will be as good as new . start with the four centre pieces of one colour at the bottom - and build up the cube layer by layer . remember ! no force
1	great game for all ages . lots of fun if played with many people . very intertaining
0	here 's a quick primer for parents looking to buy science kits for the early grade school set ( i.e. , k - 3rd ) . every science kit , including this one , basically tells you to mix vinegar with baking soda and `` voila ! '' you made a volcano . nevermind that in later years some kid will go hiking in the crater of mt . st. helen 's during an eruption thinking it is just harmless cooking products . use safe chemicals to make scientific changing colors ? you guessed it -- food dye . all these kits basically include a set of plastic test tubes and instructions telling you to open your kitchen cupboards . back in the middle ages people who sold this kind of hokum for the price it now commands were called alchemists . they eventually went out of business . buy the kid a suzukie violin or a football helmet instead
0	my daughter really wanted the cloud kingdom for christmas . as soon as i saw the quality of it , i should have returned it but i knew it would break her heart . it takes up a lot of room and does not fold for storage like most barbie houses . my daughter is very frustrated with it because the pieces do not stay together , so she hardly plays with it . this toy is definately not worth the money . i wish had read the reviews on this toy so could have bought her something that she could actually enjoy
1	more track is the first thing you 're going to want to buy after your first geotrax train set . it will seem like you never have enough straights and curves to bring the track design to reality . the `` switched '' pieces work out better as the child gets older ( 3-4+ )
0	purchased these diapers ( 6/pack ) and was blown awary at the cost . took the advice of other reviews and purchased `` premee '' diapers . try to cut the cost and maybe other moms and grandmas will purchase your product
1	my daughter is almost 3 and she loves her trampoline . she is very curious about how santa got it down the chimney , though ! not easy to put together , but could be if directions were clearer . great product , great price
0	does n't do much for the price . basically your daughter watches the ballet dancers on the tv screen tries to follow along . it 's not even step by step frankly it 's somewhat difficult to follow . wish i had spent my $ $ on something else . :
0	my 10-mo-old son showed no particular interest in this `` table '' . i did not like it much either . why would a 10-mo-old show any interest in table items that sing ? i have left it without legs . two minutes after i installed the legs my son nearly fell with the `` table '' on his face . had to uninstall them . not good for active infants . also not very entertaining . buy the one from leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed the legs because they say that that one is higher than this ( might have more balance though but i do not know for sure )
0	my daughter has the ethnic version of this doll . she absolutely loves it . however , as a parent i notice that the color on the lips are peeling and the doll cheeks has no color to them like the illustration . i am also very upset that i can not get a replacement for this item . how do you tell your daughter that santa claus ca n't fix or replace this item ?
0	this is a new low , even for our feminazi-drenched anti-culture . the whole message of this whore of a doll is to tell impressionable little girls that being superficial , arrogant , shallow and slutty are positive attributes , desirable healthy , and that by contrast , having true strength of character , integrity , honor and modesty are for 'losers . ' in other words , looking and behaving like a skank tramp = `` empowerment . '' that term has been so misued over the last 30 years ( and particularly the last 10 ) , that it ceases to have any truth to it whatsoever . barbie used to epitomize what it meant to be feminine , a lady , and fulfilled -- with a husband , a home and children . now that standard has been completely perverted and ruined with the onset of dolls like this -- exchanging true values ( being a good wife and mother ) for false ones ( materialism and promiscuity ) . even barbie 's face has been uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner and collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out bratz dolls . realize -- this is a war on our children 's souls ! mattel should be ashamed of themselves , to the hilt . this is child abuse , pure and simple . any mother who allows their child to get one of these monstrosities should be jailed for neglect and have her tubes tied
1	i got one for my granddaughter ... ..and i got one for myself . i do n't know which of us will love it more . adorable ! !
1	cute barbie , good for $ 5 with free shipping . very trendy clothes , would make a good collectable because that will go out of style quickly i would think
1	i like the set up . it looks like a daycare really appears . it is great to spur on your childs creativity and role playing skills .
0	we purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the disney princesses . even though we purchased it as a `` play '' bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child . we immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be . it 's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably would n't last long anyway . i recommend you look else where for your child 's princess dreams
1	every child should have a chance to play this game at least once in their lifetime . the characters on the game board are so awesome too . queen frosting ( that was her name ... right ? ) is so pretty , she was always my favorite character . all in all , it 's a great game and a great gift for nearly any child
0	i have to agree with the other on here . i got this for my 5yr for christmas and she seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now it sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it . i was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat , not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead . i tried and did n't think it was all that fun either . i threw the box away and i 'm sure i need that to return it . if i could i would get her something else in return that she could use
0	my son received this car for christmas and i was appalled . amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery , which was no problem getting . but as for the 9 v turbo battery and charger , good luck finding that . i bought it when it was on sale for $ 19.99 and the original price said it was $ 59.99 , so i thought that i was getting a deal . huge mistake ! i did n't know that i would have to purchase an additional $ 20 battery . no wonder why it was only $ 19.99 ! its a piece of junk . i also got the batboat , but i 'm afraid to see what that might need . my advice , dont get it
0	i am the mother of two elementary aged children who love art projects . this was a christmas gift and i was never so disappointed in the quality of this item . it arrived with crayons broken and the ones that were n't , you could n't even use on paper . the markers are dry and caps do n't stay on . this is a terrible product and the price is ridiculous ! ! ! definitely would be better off purchasing these items elsewhere ! !
1	the nephews loved it . we sent it to them along with other gifts for christmas . turns out the twin 8 year olds found this to be their favorite gift . the light up part was pretty cool but they did have some trouble bouncing the ball . when the lights went out the fun really happened . everything went well even when it turned into tackle-basketball . not their mom 's favorite sport but no harm ... no foul .
1	this is perfect for any stop-motion animator . with over 30 posable joints , thoron is inexpensive compared to other figures.also , thoron 's nemosis , stendhal , is a great figure for animation
1	i-dog is so fun to use ! all you have to do is plug the included cable into your digital player 's headphone port and i-dog will play your music through a tiny internal speaker . i-dog 's face will light up with various patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you play . his tail serves as a mute button , but be careful because he does n't like you touching too often ! i-dog will get sad if you do n't give him any music to listen to . if you do n't have a digital player , you can set i-dog by your boombox or other music device and he can `` hear '' that way . there are only two reasons why i did n't give i-dog 5 stars : ( 1 ) the internal speaker is n't very loud , so you have to have your music player turned up quite high , and ( 2 ) the battery cover on i-dog 's back leg is really hard to get off . you will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver to get it off
1	it is an okay seat . my only complaint is that my son has slightly chubby legs and the area on the chair where his legs go and the whole `` pummel '' thing seem kind of tight and uncomfortable for him . we started him in it at about 4 months . he sits in it for only short periods of time , he gets uncomfortable pretty fast . otherwise , a decent chair
0	the webkinz yorkie puppy i received is total different from what shown on the picture . evne though it is still a dog it is not the one displaied on the picture which my kid really like . it is a total waste
0	i bought this toy for my three-yr-old . she was excited , but then one of the dolls fell apart , its pelvis broke and the legs fell out . super glue might fix it , but i 'm not sure . i 'd recommend it for an older child who would n't play with it so roughly . but for the price , i wanted it to last more than three days
0	i purchased the havoc heli for my dad . he saw an ad for it on tv and wanted one , so i was excited that amazon.com had it for a lower cost and free shipping . however , that was as far as the `` good '' went . my dad was disappointed to find out that not only could the havoc heli not pick up and fly with the accessories that came with it , but it had a difficult time flying without any `` extra weight '' . this helicopter has no risk of creating any havoc . but , it does make a cute little paperweight .
0	my 2 1/2 yr old son actually loves this product but he loves to take it apart as well . we tighten the little colored pegs and a few weeks later he 's taking them off again . so far he 's brought me pretty much everything that can come off including bolts with small washers . thank goodness he 's past the stage of sticking everything in his mouth . also like everyone else we 've had the same problem with the chalk board scratching just from writing on it with chalk . i 've always liked the melissa and doug products we 've purchased but i would n't reccomend this easel at all
1	yes , all the princess need a prince to fight over . we had a blonde to do the honors but the girls are much happier having 2 competing males to do the honors . his clothes are easy to get on and he is as dashing as they come . need to find one more less european prince to finish the collection
0	loud annoying and entertaining for only a day . i got this doll because my 3 and 5 year olds , both `` had to have it '' . they watched it dance for about 30 minutes and that was the extent of the play with this doll . it is n't a doll that they can use imagination with , snuggle with , or any other type of constructive play . a dora video would have been a better choice . at least their attention would have been captured for the 30 minutes and then they would have watched it again later . in order to get the skirt to stay on ( to change the song she danced to ) i had to push very hard . my kids could n't do it on their own
1	my 7 year old son got this set for christmas last year , and with all the toys we have for our 5 kids , this k'nex set gets the most use . he built with it every day for months , and still builds something new about every week with it . he has built about every model in the book and he is getting better at building his own ideas . we 've gotten a lot of the models on video tape , and he loves to show his grandparents the new ones . i loved the sea turtle that `` walked '' across the floor , and he builds amusement park rides and puts little people in them . this thing keeps him busy for hours at a time , and he 's getting another tub of them for his birthday . his little brother wants one for his birthday this year . the motor is very cool , and he figures out how to use it with the models that do n't call for it . since christmas , he has only broken 2 pieces , so i thought that was pretty good . highly recommended
1	i give this 4 stars , because i like it ( maybe more than my toddler ) . when i was in kindergarten or 1st grade , my little brother , who was 1 or 2 at the time , had the original -- the one that just popped , and he loved it . he would push it around until the popping drove my father `` crazy . '' this one does even more . it pops , counts from 1 to 10 , plays music , and has flashing lights . i think it 's an awesome toy , especially for the price . my daughter does n't play with it every day , but when she grabs it , she 'll push it around for maybe 10 minutes or more ( we have n't found a single toy that will occupy her attention for longer than that ) . sometimes , she 'll push it around several times a day . it 's great for that stage when your toddler likes to push or drag things around with them . the popping was inconsistent when we first received it , but we took it apart , got the gears aligned correctly ( through trial error ) , added more vaseline to the gears for lubrication , and now it pops , counts , plays music , and the lights flash consistently every time . if you take this toy apart , be careful not to pull out the speaker wires -- we did that , but it was no problem . my husband soldered the wires back together
0	this toy ca n't be unsed unless you go online and `` update '' it . we have spent countless hours trying to `` update '' this toy - and ther is always a problem . the website is down or some other technical problem . then if the website is up - you go through the whole process and the toy still does not update - so it is unusable ! it is a complete waste of money
1	j sports superstore shipped this as professioally packed as lightning quick as amazon has done ! ! ! this is a great gift for any one with a love for horses as my children do . anything horse related is a hit in this home . i like the fact that monopoly , one of my all time favorites , is available now in just about any theme . go check out j j sports superstore for your favorite themed monopoly game
1	this was a christmas gift , and the person loved it . i was so happy i chose this website to purchase from ! !
0	i ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for christmas and even though the stores were sold out , she was sure that santa could get it for her . when my daughter called to make sure that i had it actually in hand - i said sure - i ordered it from amazon ! after all , the description said that was the swimming mermaid ... that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water . it is not ! ! ! ! like the other lady said - it is just another barbie doll in a green dress . now i will have to pay a premium to get it from ebay ( where i could have gotten it for less a week ago ) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before christmas . i will have pay 6 times what i paid for this deception and hope that santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed . beware of this seller ! i see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description . believe me - it was there before
1	my niece was learning about the birth of christ at school when i got her this nativity set . she was so happy and it was so easy for me to continue teaching her about the birth of christ and christmas . thanks - i was very satisfied with this item and so was my niece
1	it is a little smaller than i expected ... but i guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand . other than that , it 's perfect . my son 's room has an atlanta braves theme so the colors are perfect . the main reason i bought this was to use as a toy box . so far , it 's worked out great ! i do n't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small do n't bother me . the only thing i have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank .
1	this is a simple pirate ship tub toy with two backyardigans characters . my pirate enthusiasts ( ages 6 , 4 and 2 ) love it . it does n't move or make noise , but it floats well and is sturdy . the best part is that the characters fit in the bottom of the ship for easy storage
1	my son has played with these from 6 months old , and still likes them occasionally ( 18 months now ) . the small car is nice for babies to shake . they do n't do much , but they are cute
1	ok , this toy does not deserve 5 stars but the other reviews were far too harsh . the first 30 minutes of my chihuahua terrified by this thing were worth the price . as a stuffed animal it 's very cute but not too cuddly because it 's hard plastic under the fur . i love scrat in the movie and the sounds this thing makes are quite funny at first but the do get boring soon unless you have a family pet to terrorize like i do . here 's another trick . put scrat on a pillow with your hadn behind him so you can make him move and wiggle his tail without being seen , then have someone bring in the family pet . when i lunged at the dog 's feet he screamed as being run through a meet grinder . this may sound cruel but i assure you the dog was not hurt and now enjoys showing scrat who 's the boss whenever we turn him on
0	followed all directions , added fish , within hours the fish were `` sleeping '' on the bottom of the tank . luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so i took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better . changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water , added fish , 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom . took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better . something is seriously wrong with this tank . bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what ... they are doing great ! do not put fish in the shark tank . they will die
1	we purchased this set for my son christmas 2003 . he loves it . the age range on the listing is off , though . it should be the same for any of the little people toys - 12 or 18 months and up . there are no small parts . highly recommended and fun during the holidays or any time
1	transaction went well . grandkids are having a blast at using the product ... innovatively with lots of fun and excitement
0	ok , my kid loves it . but , after seeing it in person , i cant believe how much i was charged for list little plastic toy . cost is way over excessive . strongly suggest saving your money , unless money is no object
0	the game has a nice concept , if it worked . i 've been trying since christmas ( over 3 months ) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today . something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds , but the web site is always down ! ! ! ! ! experancing technical problems ! ! ! and the nice window that pop 's up on the home page from the chief , asking for suggestions goes to a bad link ! ! ! i only gave it 1 star because the review process does n't have a 0 stars . do n't waste any money on this thing ! ! ! !
0	i got this for my 6 and 3 year olds . they both really like it ( 3 year old needs help remembering which letter goes with which color ) . of course they used up the 8 designs in the first 2 days . hasbro.com does carry refill packs , but the website is so bad that it is hard to find them . do n't bother searching on the word `` refill '' ! there is a form you can print out and then mail in , but this is kind of ridiculous both in waiting and in price . the form is under replacement parts , but it does n't even identify what you are buying . after digging around , i deduced that it was refill sheets : i think 10 pictures for 6.99 including some bonus pegs ? there is an after-market web site where you can instantly purchase downloadable pictures 13 for 4.95 , but you actually print them ( including the black background ! ) on your own printer with your own ink ! ouch . hasbro really disappointed me on this one . they shuld have included at least 20 pictures with the item and should sell 40 packs replacements online for about 5.00 . thumbs up to the toy . thumbs down to hasbro . also , the light bulb on mine flickers all the time as if it is about to short out
1	my daughter thinks these are the most adorable fairies . they adorn every possible accessory she and her friends can attach them to . you never know who will have which charms as they are always swapping them . i would say that you get an amazing bang for your buck with these . they are the `` in '' thing right now with her 4th grade friends
0	i bought two of these as christas gifts . one for my son and one for my nephew . my kids have played with it a few times now and my wife and i are looking for an oppourunity to pitch the whole mess in the trash . not only does this stuff look like sand , but it gets into everything just like real sand . the play mat they include in this kit doesnt come close to containing the mess . on top of all that the stuff deosnt clump together all that well . all and all i would reccomend this product only for childeren over 8yrs and then only for outside play unless you really enjoy cleaning up .
1	i like the fact that we can make all different sounds for cydney and she just loves to listen to it.. ca n't wait till she can play with it hersel
1	this track set is ok but it 's not that thrilling . we ended up buying more track and other stops . over all the train is great .
1	i think the hair may be a bit over done but everything else is right on . i like the make-up and the clothes and she does seem to resemeble veronica from the archie comics i remember reading as a child . i give her 4 three-quarter stars . ( it would be five if the hair were better . ) she 's still a great doll though . nearly perfect ! ! ! ! !
0	this item is too difficult for a six year old even though advertised as for 5-8 year olds . you can not return the item once opened , so do not order
1	my children are 7 , 5 and 20 months , and they all love it . the baby is especially fascinated by it and was able to make the top spin by herself after her brothers coached her a bit . the humming sound is much less annoying the many of their battery operated toys with voices and electronic noises
0	bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra parts . but the surprise here is the complicity of amazon in this misleading packaging . this is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found . they know they made a mistake . if only they would contact us each now for a full refund . i wish a rep from amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger . i wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for . ..his `` big '' gift
1	my son received this toy for his first birthday ! i will be purchasing it as gifts for all my friends ! ! he loves pushing the button and listening the the music . i was wondering if he would be able to figure out the gears , but he has caught on very quickly and loves to take the gears off and put them back on . he also enjoys stacking the gears up and watching them go around ! i like that it has a handle so he can carry it around with him . it keeps him involved for up to 20 minutes at a time ! it is very durable as he carries it around , has chewed on the gears ( which are made of strong plastic and can not be marred by chewing on them ) . my three year old also likes to play with it ! her play is a little sofisticated with it as she tries to figure out which gears have to be put where ( as in , do they have to be next to the middle spinning one ) placed to make them spin and how many can be stacked and they still turn . my one wish is that playskool would include a few extra gears . we have them everyhwere in our house and can not always find them all . it would be great if they had a place where you could purchase extra ones for replacements and/or to have extras for stacking . this is an awesome toy that the kids love , can learn from , and is very durable ! it is a must have !
1	strawberry shortcake is a princess ! ! ! ! ! and she is being pulled in a carriage by her prince who is on a horse . they are both sooooo cute ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this is one of the cutest ss dolls i have ever seen ! this is a definite must-have for me and for all ss doll lovers ! buy her now ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 5 very big very bright bold stars ! ! ! ! ! ! this is the best ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	muffet vs spider ! this is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as muffet makes it a kick butt scene . again the turn is to the s pink black leather bondage look , similar to the spiked outfit of red riding hood . this is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it 's a great display piece . the downfall from five stars is that when setup , muffet is almost obscured by the spider . both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures
0	perhaps a age group should be posted as with most toy sellers . i bought it for my 4 year old nephew and it 's worthless to anyone other than i guess stores who like to stick star war stickers on the retail counters . it is deceiving and the retailer is arrogant and would not even consider a return since it was opened to see what it was . avoid this retailer and it 's products
1	i have loved reading archie comics since i was in high school . i was thrilled to find the archie dolls for sale . thanks
0	my five and half year old daughter asked for this particular barbie doll . she was so happy when she opened her present and found mermaidia elina doll . she took it out of the box and started to play with it . soon enough she lost interest however . the wings are large , so large they are actually a burden . placing the doll inside the mermaid tail is not easy for little hands either . all in all , this doll is just `` make-up '' if you see what i mean . pretty but not easy to play with , and easily forgotten . she is on a stand in my daiughter 's room , and has n't been touched or played with since christmas morning ... not worth the price
1	the quality and workmanship of this item was very good . i gave it to my grandson for x-mas . it was almost identical to the one his father had at his age . thanks for a quality product
1	our son is 2 y.o . and had a great time with this puzzle . enjoy all the animals
1	this review is not about the toy , but about the service you can expect to receive from amazon.com . if you are buying this as a gift , only do so if you have months to wait , even if the item is listed as available . amazon.com will allow you to pay your money under the guise of sending your items , and then days later , inform you of a delay in shipping , and then a week later inform you the item has just shipped and can take up to an additional 10 days for delivery . despite the site 's claims that the item would ship in 24hrs and be delivered in 3-5 days . mind you , they 're sending it via ups or american home ... . honestly , there are other retailers out there who are more reliable than amazon.com and i strongly recommend using them - unless you 're okay disappointing the little girl in your life . i know i hate having to tell my neice that the gift i promised her still wo n't be there - even though her birthday has passed , by almost a week at this poin
1	we love this game . all members of the family can play it and we 've enjoyed it as a family many time
0	these balls did not retain there `` round '' shape from the minute my 2 1/2 year old daughter played with them . the balls have that `` smashed in '' appearance and you can not get them back to the original shape . i purchased these balls to add to the ball playland made by the moose mountain toymakers , ltd that i purchased for my daughter for christmas . the balls that were included with the ball playland have retained their shape , unlike the balls i purchased separately
1	this pack makes this game more fun and allows more people . the rules change a little when using it , but they are easy to understand and lots of fun . i highly recommend getting this pack if you have ever wanted to play with more people
1	this toy is wonderful for several reasons . for one thing , it 's really the only shape sorter your child will ever need . it has very basic shape sorting ( with cut out holes in the sides and one door that can be opened for any shape block to go in ) , plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks . the toy also helps teach colors and animals , and the locks develop fine motor skills even further . overall , this toy is very well made . it 's real wood , dove tailed together . it could , of course , fall over , but if your child is the 18 months or older that is recommended for this toy , he or she probably is n't small enough for it to hurt . the locks on this toy are a little more chintzy . they wobble , which makes locking or unlocking some of them more difficult ... but you could look at this as just another learning tool . my biggest concern is that the blocks are relatively small ; they could squeeze through a toilet paper tube . this means they are a potential choking hazard , so you 'll want to supervise when your child uses this toy . all that said , my 20 month old loves this toy and plays with it more than anything else she has
0	i purchased this item yesterday , also set it up as shown . there is a little plastic gray piece that sticks up and doesnt let the cars go through . we have yet also to get one car through . a huge disappointment to my son who was excited about it . but i called mattel and they gave me a gift card for the amount i purchased it for . great customer service . i think this product should be recalled because the cars do shoot back at you at an alarming speed . hit my son in the head .
0	this playhut was very frustrating for our children . my children enjoyed it when it was left in the slumber position . our trouble began when we turned it into a tent . the sleeping bag is one side of the tent . it 's heavy so it sags leaving little room for children to play . after about ten minutes , the playhut was turned over and on the ground . we returned it..
1	of course , this is every childs dream ! ! ! ! ! ! these pets , the turtles , are the best ! i got them and played with them for along time ! ! ! ! ! ! i wish i had every on of them ! ! ! ! ! and if i could , i would rate this a billion stars ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i reccomend this to anyone who loves but ca n't have real pets , cause they would really love these `` littlest pets ! ! !
1	this is the best game ever , has over 100,000 words . you can select your catigory and how many letters . each time you get the word right you get points , and they get higher and higher , and if u get it wrong it gets lower . ..
0	i did n't know you had to line up the arrows on the motor part so we installed it incorrectly and it rotated counterclockwise ; my husband took the whole thing apart and reversed the battery terminals so that it would turn clockwise , then it worked just fine . the instructions do n't mention that you have to align the motor to the terminals in a certain fashion or it will turn backwards . but once you get it lined up right it works fine with hershey 's syrup . a great starter fountain for my chocaholic 2nd grader
0	i bought this toy for my sons 3rd birthday . he likes it , but the bean bucket is really light and only takes one or two beans to tip it . he does not seem to mind because he is so young , but as he gets older i do not think this will be one of his favorites . i have a feeling this one will be sitting in the closet
1	i love this playpen ! ! durable plastic , can be extended to larger size ( or shortened if going someplace that is not as large ) . only problem is that my baby loves to `` wander . '' she is not thrilled when mommy `` cages '' her up in order to protect her while i make dinner and can not watch her as closely as necessary . crib toys can be safely attached on the sides ( did that with her aquarium toy , which she loves and it soothes her ) . occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her . i just put her other toys in for her to play with
0	my mom is an avid wheel of fortune fan , and for x-mas i thought i 'd buy this for her since it reminded me of a wheel of fortune game we use to have . man do i regret it . she never plays it anymore . the puzzles are limited and will start to repeat within a few weeks . the keys on the keypad are hard to push in , and if you do n't push it in right soon enough you lose your turn and the general game-play is blah . really , if you bought this for someone , it 's the kind of present that they 'd be happy with for all of a few hours . then they 'd let it collect dust . like my mum is =
1	this toy is so much fun ! i play with it every day with my sister brother . altogether we have about 50 lps . i have the most
1	our daughter received this puzzle for her 3rd birthday . she 's a puzzle nut ! this became an instant favorite and had to be left together for all to see . the picture sheet in it labels all the sea creatures and it becomes a great way to discuss the different levels of life in the ocean . the coloring is beautiful - mom and dad enjoy it as well . it is extrememly well built , sturdy and can really be wiped off with a damp cloth . the only negative , as another viewer pointed out , is the darker bottom pictures . harder for young ones to distinguish designs and not as visually appealing .
0	i ordered 200 hundred of these and half of them were squashed by the time i received the shipment and you ca n't get the shape back . if you want good quality balls spend your money on the playhut version .
1	the game is fun ... .we played it when we lost electricity during hurricane isabel and was kept entertained ! i dont know if i would take everything in the game as seriously as everyone else is , writing bad reviews . if you look to a board game for `` truth '' in life , youre not going to get far ! this game is fun and makes you think and re-think what you think you know ! i suggest it for teens
1	this toy is great for many reasons ! ! tengamo are collectible gaming magnets with funny characters . you get 6 in a pack and really cool stickers ! each character has point value and rarity . if you 're lucky , you might get one of the very rare tengamos and sell it for $ $ $ $ on ebay ! you can also play hundreds of games with the tengamo magnet special design and little steel ball that comes in the pack . hurry to collect all of series 1 before it is `` retired '' for series 2 . highly recommended
1	my 6 yr old loves this game of war . the food chain comes to life in this game of who eats who . besides the plankton , shrimp , little fish , big fish and shark , there are also electric eel cards and ink out octopus cards for added excitement . the game is played like war , but the instructions add a slap jack element . this is not my favorite part . we have limited the slap jack part to just the electric eel card , which still annoys me and makes it difficult for a younger child to play with older children . the ink out card prevents anyone from winning that set of cards and gives the person with less shark cards a chance to win shark cards from the other person . this game can go on and on , do n't be afraid to adjust some rules to make this game more enjoyable for your little one and not so complicated . the cards are made well .
0	this game is very confusing and hard to play.thisn is a piece of junk . get the origional risk
0	this toy barely gets used in our house . it has a very low to the floor design , my 18 month old daughter has to hunch just to play with it . the sounds and characters are cute , but clunky and not very realistic . i am very dissatisfied with this purchase , not worth the investment . if you are looking for a fisher price doll house for your youngster , i would suggest checking out : fisher price - my first dollhouse . it has a higher design with more realistic characters , not so clunky . i wish we would have purchased this one instead
0	this was n't actually a card game . it was more of a book of 88 tear out sheets with one game each . they is no way that this can be played as a card game . the box does n't even indicate that it 's a card game . i thought this would be a fun card game for my husband daughter to play together . you can purchase magazines with more games for less price . i would n't recommend this product unless you would like an overpriced book of sudoku games . i 'm returning it buying an electronic version for husbands pda . the price is about the same .
1	these dolls rock ! i love nona . she 's really cool ! i also love tess . she rocks ! if you put them together , they 're double cool
1	my two year old has several of these cars , and the race track . he loves all things cars , so these were a big hit . all of the shake and go cars talk before they run , which he especially likes . they are very easy for a toddler to operate , but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them , too . they do n't run for very long per shake , but that does n't seem to bother him at all
0	hard to follow instructions , i ended up throwing it in a drawer after trying to get the hang of it after 5 minutes . if you want to buy one , i will give you mine : ) total waste of money .
0	the trailer is sooooooooooo fake . if i jumped around in these `` moon shoes '' like the kids in the trailer id be in the hospital by now ! ! ! these shoes hurt your ankles sooooooooooooooo bad and are not i repeat not bouncy at all ! ! ! i was excited when i got these but very dissapointed when i used them . they are the worst toy in the world . i mean come on $ 40.00 for the worst shoes in the world . well that money just went down the drain ! ! never , ever think about buying these disastrous shoes for your child ! as i type my friend is using them and she even says they are a total disaster too ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! never never never never ever ever ever buy these shoes ! ! ! i hate them ! !
1	i 've been an amazon customer for years , but this is the first time a product stood out enough for me to write a review . i bought this for my 8 yr. old daughter and i figured my 6 yr. old son could use it later . i was very hesitant , because there are n't a lot of reviews and it 's expensive . well , we 've had it a few days and my daughter has been playing more with `` secrets of the master magician : an apprentice 's manual '' , which i also bought at the same time ( another great gift ) . my daughter is interested in this and it 's easy for her to put things together . my son is obsessed with it ! it 's similar ( for him ) to the lego creatures he puts together . he needs a little help from time to time , but he can certainly follow the very well laid out diagrams . so far they 've created an fm radio , a scifi noise maker , a sound detecting space noise maker thingy , a propeller that spins and flies into the air , a seven segment display , a volt meter connected to the solar cell . after connecting the solar cell , i realized my son thought the solar cell would come on like a computer screen or tv ! after explaining it and putting my hand over it ; now they both know what a solar cell does . - there are 5 books of experiments . - each project has a nice simple color picture of how to connect all the components . - all components are clearly marked . - the diagrams are a top view . since the connections are layered on top of one another 2 and 3 deep , it takes a little figuring as to what 's on top and what 's on bottom . it 's easy for an adult . it 's part of the `` puzzle '' for the kids . after we put a few together , they both got it . - the pieces seem sturdy enough and snap together easily - there is great assortment of parts to create lots and lots of very interesting projects . - my kids love the projects . i 've been very impressed . - it has a cable that you can connect to the microphone port of a pc sound card . i have n't played with this . there is software , it looks like you can turn your pc into an oscilloscope . looks interesting . there 's a whole book for these projects . i just saw the cover , so it 's likely that there 's even more to it . my kids are learning a lot with this . while they are putting things together , i can explain how these different parts work . there are lots of opportunities to take the project and modify it by replacing parts , change a light out for the speaker , etc . for example , my son put the 7 segment led together . i was n't impressed . i was hoping to put together a counter , but it just connects each segment to ground to turn all the segments on . there are 750 projects , so maybe there is a counter project . regardless , my son was fascinated . he changed all the connections manually to count from 0 to 9 . he changed the main power resistor to see it go brighter with a smaller resistor and dimmer with a bigger resistor . lots of implicit learning going on . i pointed to the microwave display and said , `` see , that 's how it works !
1	its a really good present , for anniversaries , birthdays , etc . also its fun to do with a team or a club
1	this movie teaches the basic ballet steps with the use of a mat . although it is a little slow in the beginning , once the dancing starts my daughter is hooked . we started with with a vhs and had to buy a dvd because we played the video so much .
1	i bought this for my girls when they were six months old and at two years they still like the colorful birds ! this is a great toy , well made and interesting . this would also be a wonderful gift
1	this is a very pretty doll . i waited until this year to buy her and got her for only fifteen dollars . in my opinion that is the only way to buy these fancy dolls -- on sale ! otherwise they are just too darn expensive . i give this particular doll 4 stars . she has a pretty face and i like her hair . i think the dress is a bit overdone but that is just me . i have very simple tatstes
1	i have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies . when i first found these connectors , no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together . i asked every store in town almost ( some did n't even know what they were ! ) . i just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work . so i went out and bought two kolcraft lil ' limo strollers , not knowing , of course , if it would work or not . i 'm happy to say that they seem to work really well ! i did have to buy a second set , though , so i have five connectors on mine ( could n't find room for the sixth one ) . just lock the two inner front wheels so they ca n't turn and you 're off ! it is a little hard to turn corners ( just take them at a wide angle ) , but otherwise it works great ! i ended up spending just under [ price ] for the total cost of it , much less buying an actual quad stroller . i hope this info will be helpful to someone else also . good luck
1	this is a great puppet theater , sound stage , restaurant , play house , etc ... my daughter was 4 when she received this from santa . he only wished he had found it sooner ! my daughter continues to love it , and will now be sharing it with her younger sister . many hours of pretend have been spent inside and outside this theater . we especially love it because it is large enough inside for two or more children . all the others we researched were too small for our needs . the colors are so vibrant and fun , we get tons of compliments from all our company . all the kids gravitate towards it
1	this is a good toy for a toddler , not a baby . i 've used this toy in two different setting ( first as a nanny and then as a mom ) and both times , the babies were terrified of it . it 's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old . the balls fly everywhere and you 've got to run about after them to keep it going ; unless of course , you 've got a toddler , then they can run about after the balls ( which seems to be half the fun for them ) . good toy , but not until maybe 14 months .
0	this is a preety good game but after a while , it is very boring . i enjoyed it for about 2 months but now i am not intrested in it
1	this umbrella can be used with lots of other playsets , not just the little tikes brand . we use ours staked in the ground next to our step 2 naturally playful sandbox/wading pool and we take it along and use it with his folding plastic chair that has an umbrella hole and clip . great for hot days at the pool , beach or just hanging around in the backyard . it comes with a storage/ carry bag that has a carrying strap for over-the-shoulder hauling around , too . it has a wind vent at the top , but i would still close it at night or take it indoors if you have high winds , since it is a petite size and weighs less than similar full-size versions sold to adults . nice forest green color and white pole and finial ; the fabric is heavy-weight and overall the umbrella seems well-made . a great buy at this price
0	ok as far as novelty goes these ducks are soooo funny and what a great take on the rubber ducky ! ! ! i bought them for my 1 year old just because i am sooooo tired of the original version of the yellow ducky . anyone who feels this lil duck toy is devil worship to has some serious issues , and i would suggest they need to seek some professional help . so for the faint of heart dont buy the duck because i think it has magical powers which will make you giggle in delight .
1	grandchildren just about wore it out putting it together so many times ...
1	we 've had one in the house for a few years now . the kids ( 5 and 2-1/2 ) love it . it 's soft , cuddly , and sized just right for them . it 's been taken all over the place , has provided companionship for them on many a long trip ( including two to south korea ) , given comfort when they are sad , and been used for countless hours of make-believe . its worth has been far more than what was paid for it
1	this was my 3rd bionicle and my 1st rahkshi . so far all i need for the green bionicles is lewa the toa nuva of air , it is sold out every where . well any way each rahkshi has a staff with speacial powers , rahkshi lerahk 's staff can poison anything at touch
1	i am quite fond of this character . sure , he is a horribly evil dictator who would n't give a second thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong , but you have to understand where he 's coming from . as the hulk , bruce banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity . then there is a world-wide nuclear holocaust , the world is a wasteland , and , as the hulk , bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation . fusing his mind to the hulk 's , i think he has a right to be a little screwed up and angry . this highly possible figure comes with a spiky crown thing and the appropriate comic book . he may not make a great center piece , but the figure is good looking , none-the-less
1	we have the original `` super mastermind '' which is the exact same layout . it 's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache . it 's fun to watch others work at it too . the pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it . it 's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts
0	i bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday . after playing the game once , she asked me if i could take it back . she said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game . my daughter has always played a lot of `` simulated life '' video games ( i.e. , the sims , animal crossing ) and online games ( i.e , club penguin ) . i suspect this is why she found this game limiting . other games that she has played portray a more intricate `` life '' and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree . my advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this . if your daughter has no experience in these types of games , this game will probably be fine . however if your daughter has previously played simulated life games , she will probably find this one lacking .
1	i bought my seven and ten year old daughters moon shoes for christmas . i had read all the reviews , so i immediately instructed the girls to always wear their bicycle helmets when playing with their moon shoes . yes , they can be dangerous , but with a few precautions , i think the kids will have more fun , be safer , and the parents will have peace of mind . 1 . do n't let the kids start jumping right away , hold their hand or have them put their hand on your shoulder as they practice walking in them . 2 . once they 've achieved the ability to balance , have them practice bouncing in place just a little bit . this will help them learn to balance as they move and learn how the moon shoes respond to the way they move . 3 . set ground rules , no bouncing when there is a lot of debris around , no bouncing while holding objects , always wear helmet , no bouncing near each other , and if you feel or hear any of the rubber bands break while bouncing sit down immediately and take off the shoes . my kids spent the first half hour/45 minutes getting use to their moon shoes . they now can bounce around with stability and confidence
1	we love this game . it seems to be the most fun with 5 or 6 people , although my husband and i also enjoyed the 2-person version . we do not usually use the board . we just use a scorepad to keep track of points . once you catch on to the game , it 's not too hard to come up with answers . highly recommended
0	people this is a brand new game out for the v-smile system . walmart has tuns of them in the store for 19.99 ! do n't waste your money ! this store is lying ! ! ! !
0	far to difficult to pop , product did n't match picture . but the company was very friendly and co-operative in the return process . would do business with this company again , but would buy one item as a test before buying in bulk . or i would just call the company
1	i bought this for my 5 year old son for christmas . not only did he think it was great but also his 7 and 9 year old sisters . there are so many games that there was something for all of them . we took the toy with us to grandma 's and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining . i really like that they can play all the games in spanish too . once they have got the hang of a game in english they can do it in spanish and it helps increase their vocabulary . i was a little nervous if it would be worth the $ 50 because i had seen the barbie laptops and some others at radio shack . this one seemed like the best choice and was hoping this would be worth it . in my opinion it is much better than the others we tried in the store and i would definately recommend it
1	this is my daughters first `` real '' baby doll . she is almost 2 , and i have never seen her love another toy like this one . she loves to give the baby kisses and feed her with the bottle it comes with , and i bought an extra outfit so she can change the baby for bed . this doll is really pretty compared to other baby dolls i have seen lately . the skin is a very soft , nice feeling plastic with a cloth torso , and smells like sweet baby powder ! i was pleased when i was able to wipe off dirt that was on the dolls hand really easily . i love all the accessories that you can get for the little mommy dolls too . i highly recommend this one
1	i have a 10 month old and a 3 1/2 yr old who both love this tunnel ! ! ! ! !
1	i got these for my 28 month old daughter for valentines day as she is fascinated by skating . they are a pain to put on , but she does n't mind . they have `` beginner '' settings , which she used for the first hour and then it was on to the `` expert '' setting ! what i like is all the safety gear come with them , so she knows that she has to wear it `` all or nothing '' . these are great and seem to be safe and sturdy ... with supervision , of course
1	i 've read the other reviews ... as i was skimming the website to order another of these wands . guess you folks had a bad batch of wands , because my son is crazy about his . we gave it to him shortly after his 2nd birthday , and it 's one of his favorite toys ! yes , it is messy ... it 's a giant bubble wand ... when was the last time you played bubbles that there was n't a mess ? but if you keep it out doors , i do n't see the problem . my son was able to make bubbles right away ( something he was n't able to do with smaller wands since he ca n't seem to blow ( he sucks air in instead of out ) . his father and i played for over an hour with this wand ... taking turns making the bubbles and letting him pop them ( and vice versa ) . i do n't know why the other folks had some difficulty ... but i would highly recommend this toy for a 2-3 year old .
1	great slide ! ! no assembly required , just unfold and your ready for fun..perfect size for young toddlers . bright colors and cute , happy carrot face . great fun for indoors or out
0	i just finished the world 's largest crossword puzzle last night . it 's been one heck of a project -- approximately equivalent to 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles . i 'm going to love hanging the puzzle on my wall -- it really is something to behold when it 's all done . but it 's also a big undertaking that requires a great deal of patience and perserverance . the puzzle itself is moderately difficult , but made more so by the fact that somewhere during the revision ( it 's been re-done once ) or perhaps during the original construction some errors were made . because of this , many of the clues do n't match the answers . add to that the fact that the author uses many hundreds , possibly even thousands , of abbreviations that are specific to a certain field ( e.g . `` abbreviation used in electrical engineering '' ) that no lay person ever has a chance of knowing , and you 've got what can be an exercise in frustration . you can work for hours on one small section and only later find out that the clue does n't fit the answer . i 'm generally pretty dogged in completing crosswords until letter perfect , but that 's not possible here . so i had to sacrifice a bit of my honor and force myself to give up after a couple of passes through the ups and downs . still , it 's about 98+ percent solvable , which is pretty good when you consider how intricate the puzzle is and how hard it must have been to create . overall , i enjoyed the process and am pleased with the result . if you 've got the time and energy , i highly recommend this .
1	i got this yesterday for my daughters ( 3 6 years old ) , and they like it very much ... let 's see how long that lasts . the space is kind of cramped , but both of them fit in there with a few dolls , so i would n't complain about that . setting it up was pretty easy , and although it has almost no stability ( it gets toppled every couple of minutes or so ) , that does n't seem to take away the fun from it . however , there were a couple of surprises for me : a ) the product i got is very different from the picture in the advertisement . it is still shaped like a castle and has the disney princesses and all , but it is just different . i am not complaining , my girls like it a lot . b ) as i said before , setting it up was fairly easy ( just keep your face away as you take it out of the box , for it will spring out on you very fast ) , but , trying to disassemble it and putting it away is a completely different story . for that , you have to remove 4 rods ( which were not so easy to insert in the first place ) , and then , you have to fold the thing away twisting it in a way that only experienced snake handlers would be expected of being able to do so ( i do n't care how easy it should be according to the instructions ) . i tried it for about 20 minutes until i gave up . and , if you do n't keep the box this thing came in , just forget about storing it folded , it would be like trying to keep a `` jack in the box '' compressed without the `` box '' . think about it . so , if you do n't mind adding this to the permanent decor of your house , go for it , your girls will probably like it .
0	game did n't work , but amazon was very accomodating with a refund including shipping
1	very nicely done . brought it for my grand-daughter who is 5yrs old and it is sturdy and has room to gro
1	tamagothchis are so much fun they are really col and there a little hard to care for and its fun watching them change they are a great item and worth there valu
0	my daughter plays with an older round version sit and spin at daycare alot . all the kids like it there . she got the simon says version for christmas from her aunt and it pretty much sucks . she tried to play with it every once in a while but got so frustrated we have now just put it the attic because she wo n't touch it and it was in the way . it does n't spin very well at all ( possibly due to the oval shape ? ? ) no matter where my daughter sits on it . also the audio is very loud and annoying with no volume control . also it seems much cheaper made than the older style she plays with at daycare . i would say do n't waste your money on the simon says sit n spin - try to find an older one at a second hand store or garage sale . my recommendation to playskool would be to go back to the original design - a round sit n spin , no sound - just pure and simple fun
0	this was a waste of money ! ! i bought these for my daughter sophie , who is 23 months old , as a valentines day gift . the crayons are very small and the holder makes them appear to be bigger . the crayons all kept falling out of their holders and my daughter did n't enjoy playing with them . i was not impressed and do not recommend these to anyone .
0	my son was so excited for this toy . it was all he asked for on his 8th birthday . we went out to the lake this week and then began our frustration . first there is no way to launch this 30 feet unless the wind gusts and the moon and planets are alligned . then the `` safety '' bobber is so safe it does n't even open when it hits the water , but does cause such a large ripple in the lake that all fish are gone for hours . my son set it down after a hour of frustration and had me trek to the car to grab is old trusty fishing rod , that is not as colorful and plastic but does actually cast and catch fish . do n't get me wrong , i think the rod is a gret idea but the people who designed it did a very slipshoddy job , and i would warn anyone about spending money on it .
1	i was a bit afraid after reading the reviews , but this game is a hit with kids all ages . it takes about 3 minutes to set up , but it 's not hard and the bees do n't fall thru . we played more times than i can count this past week , and everyone enjoyed . i bought it for my 5 year old , but her cousins ( ages 19 , 17 and 13yo ) joined in the fun and actually asked to play . my husband and i also got a kick out of it ! even our 3yo loved it , but she is incredibly lucky and would just pull randomly at leaves and none dropped , she 's good ! our child did n't get bored while we were setting it back up , but everyone was sticking leaves and talking , so i guess it depends on your children 's patience or attention span . in a few words : we all loved it
1	samantha is 13 months and walking . she enjoys pushing the baby around in the stroller . she thinks she is a big girl . she pushes her baby , her elmo , and any animal we ask her to take for a walk .
0	i had this this a couple years ago and it kept jamming on me
0	my sone loves this trike , but has not been able to use it much due to the fact that it keeps breaking . the first one i got had a broken steering wheel lock - it kept slipping into lock position and my son could n't turn the wheel anymore ! so i called radio flyer and they graciously sent out a new one ( i did not have to provide proof of purchase or anything ) . on the new one , the parent handle would not lock into place . so i called again and they sent out a new parent handle . i replaced it and everything seemed to work fine until we went up or down a slight incline in which case the handle would come unlocked again . i called radio flyer again . at this point , they are sending a new one which quality control is supposed to look over first , and they want the old one back to take a look at it . i really do like this trike , but the quality is not great . if you purchase it and have problems , definitely call radio flyer to get one that works correctly . do n't even bother to return it to the store . radio flyer will send parts or replacements free of charge and you do n't have to hassle with going back to the store
0	as the other reviewers stated , it 's difficult for my 5 2-year-olds ( their mommy ) to figure out . also , it 's made of a very cheap , flimsy plastic -- which seems to be the norm for a lot of the hot wheels tracks , etc . terrible truck with such great potential
0	well , the toy just does not perform the way it 's suposed to . they do n't fly high in the arena and hardly ever knock eachother out as they are suposed to do . very unhappy with product . huge disappointment for my 6 and 8 year old sons !
1	my 4 year old child loves this car ! he spend a lot of time playing with it , and it 's incredible all the functions and programing it has , and what he loves more it 's his talking realistic mouth ! totaly recomendable
0	the batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman . but this same boy gets extremely frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it comes with . you have to insert it `` just-so '' to get it to shoot when you press the button and my son does n't always do it , then i have to get a butter knife and pry it out so i can put it in for him . for 10 dollars it 's worth it , so long as your child does n't absolutely want a shooting batmobile . ps . my sister bought the same one for her son this christmas and is having the same problem , so i do not think it is unique to mine
0	my daughter received this as a gift we all found it extremely difficult to use . i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out . it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy . there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand play . it is too advanced difficult to use for the ages listed . the screen on the monitor was low graphics poor lighting quality as well . this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter
1	the game pieces are very good quality . i found the cards to be challenging . the game was well worth the money .
0	this product arrived broken and all the pieces are smashed . the saddest part is it was a birthday gift for a child who really wanted to play . now , learning i purchased this from toys r us via amazon have found i can not return it to amazon it has to go thru the manufacturer . to rate this product is very hard because it is in pieces .
0	this is the grossest blob of sugary water ever to touch my lips ! how could you make ice cream taste so rotten ? bat barf i say ! ! even if it was good , it is much too great of a hassle ! it took my dad over 2 hours to put together , and what did we get ? ! a tablespoon of milky water with sprinkles on top ! i got this hunk of junk 2 years ago , christmas . it has gathered dust on my shelf ever since !
0	although these keys are one of my 14 month old son 's favorite toys , one of the buttons came off and fell into the shell of the remote control . it was the larger button to turn on the light and he would have likey choked on it had it fallen into his mouth . if you purchase these , be sure to supervise your child playing with them at all times ! however , i would suggest not purchasing them
0	i purchased this coffee maker for my 3 yr. old son who loves to role play with the real coffee maker we have . he was very excited about having his `` own '' coffee maker , however after only a few days it quit working . the lights and sound still work but the water wo n't run anymore , he was very disappointed as this was his favorite part of the toy . he still enjoys playing with the coffee maker so i will probably not return it because i think it would just break again and he has already accepted the fact that the water does n't work !
0	this is a very cheap toy and mine arrived broken , or at least i hope it 's not supposed to sound like it does . it sounds nothing like the classic jack-in-the-box that i was hoping for
1	of all the toys our son has gotten , this one has stood the test of time . for over 2 years he has consistently sought out this train to play with . it has survived being dropped on almost a daily basis and still keeps going . highly reccommend
0	as others have said , this is a neat concept , but in reality , it does n't work that great . after drawing on it , you wet a sponge to erase it . think about a small child wetting a sponge . it ends up a dripping mess ! then they end up with runny marker all over their hands , which ends up on their clothes , etc . we 're good about watching the kids , too . you really have to take control of the sponge and make sure the board is wiped properly before the kids use it . the other thing is that none of the colors glowed very well and the kids stopped using it after only a couple of days . just a very disappointing gift . fisher price should have stuck with the original doodle pro ... my kids have had it for a year and still use it
0	i agree with the comments about the taste and size . personally i think someone should look into the false advertising . on the preztel kit , which is also a `` 4 pack '' , you only get two pretzels . one of the packs is salt and another is glaze . then you get two packs of some pretzel dough . these pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine . total rip-off . hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff
1	this is a great item . theres alot going on in such a tiny little space . the detail is great , from the kraken that can make a boat disappear , to the bone cage.there 's a collapsing bridge , a collapsing building , a trap door , runaway mill , and a cool magnetic boat race and more.it comes with jack , will , norrington , and the cannibal chief , but no davy.that was a little disappointing.but anyway its a fun item for all ages .
1	my 2.5 yr old son loves this puzzle . i help him put it together and he just loves the challenge and the construction equipment . i like how tough the pieces are- they have held up even when stepped on and chewed on by a baby . very nice
0	i love legos , however i too was not real impressed with the 50th anniversary tub . the lego.com websites description of the contents : each bucket includes lego system bricks in your favorite lego colors , plus a handful of gold-colored bricks ! let 's be real , we 're talking a child 's handful , not adult . my daughter was lucky enough to get 8 gold bricks in her bucket . another child i know got 4 , his brother 5 . the duplo set i bought had 6 . if you 're buying for the gold bricks , it 's not worth the money
0	santa gave this to our daughter this year . i am thoroughly disappointed with it . we put the batteries in and started it up . after reading the how to part , the graphics are terrible . i had to prompt her to which flower to step on , not that that was necessary . the princesses started dancing without stepping on the flower , it just made a funny sound . the dancers go fast and fuzzy . you ca n't tell for sure what the foot work is doing for the ballroom steps . i even went on the mat and `` tried . '' my daughter lasted all of about five minutes and was done . i hope santa will take this back
1	tried this for the first time at family gathering and enjoyed it immensely . requires concentration along with some speed and causes lots of laughter . a great family game .
0	you 'd be crazy to pay this price for a $ 3.50 toy . do n't support the greed of this vendor ! let him sit on these a while and you 'll be amazed how quick the price will drop
1	this doll looks like it will be a collectible in a few years . the lucy in paris barbie is already worth more than double what it was selling for a few years ago . this doll will probably go up in value as well . in regards to the person who returned this doll twice for a slightly dented box ... get a life ! who in the hell would return a doll just because the box had a dent ! if the doll was n't damaged why are you returning it ? ? ? ? it 's life , nothing 's perfect , get over it ! you ca n't expect perfection ... as long as the item itself is n't damaged there 's no reason to make a big fuss over the cardboard box it comes in ! this is a nice doll ( even if the box is dented ) and i would recommend purchasing it . i ordered this doll and the box mine came in was in good shape ( to me anyway ) . as far as i know , buyers on ebay are n't extremely picky on the condition of the box ... they are more concerned on the condition of the doll and whether or not it is still in the box .
1	we just set up our playhouse and i 'm very happy with it ! it 's large enough for a parent to sit inside , it was easy to set up and my 2.5 year old son is loving his new playhouse ! he really likes the basketball hoop/game side of the unit . i wish there were more electronic noises and interactive components on the walls of the playhouse , but i still think it 's a great value for the money
1	i played this when i was young so i thought my 2 1/2 year old would enjoy it too . she got to pick which color she wanted to be , and we counted how many ants to get into the pants . it took a little practice , but she got plenty of ants in and had soooo much fun . we really had a great time
0	this was big on my 8 year-old son 's christmas list , mainly because of the ben 10 game . he even wanted it more than any other game system . although i was n't about to pay full price for it , we got it at about 60 % off for the main console . so we got it , paid for an extra controller , the ben 10 game cd , and a couple of ben 10 booster packs . the unwrapping was a hit , and the excitement of the first play-through went over great with my son . but i noticed right away that it was not going to last . the game itself contains graphics from about 10 years ago . the game play is difficult , and both my son and i would find it easy to die , thus restarting the game for both of us . you can only play with the characters that happens to have come in your game or booster packs , and that 's not many . ( want more ? fork out more $ $ $ for more booster packs . ) and finally , it takes so long to load from the cd ( and it has to load every level ) that it must be a 1x drive . seriously slow . although my son still loves the idea of it and has not admitted he 's disappointed , he does comment on how slow it is , and how he wishes he had other kids to trade the cards with so he could get more . apparently we were the only suckers to buy it around here . it has n't been played but maybe 4 times in the one month since christmas . if you notice it to be on a huge discount , it may be worth it . but remember , you have to pay extra for more cards . personally , i wish we 'd bought a used gamecube with a few cartridges . that has way more staying power than the hyperscan will
1	the only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug.. other than that , this toy is simply adorable , the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable.. and the sounds it makes are truly neat . my daughter got this over a year ago , ( she is 7 now ) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs .
1	my daughter received this loom as a gift for her 6th birthday . even though the box says for ages 7 and up , and even though she 's not the most nimble-fingered kid , she has no trouble using this loom with just a little help . the materials seem to be high quality and it comes with a good amount of thick , colorful yarn . the loom has been keeping my daughter happily occupied for long periods of time . she enjoys watching me knit , but does n't have the dexterity yet to knit herself , so she 's thrilled to be able to weave herself scarves and the like
1	very pretty game and fun ; but for older children . this game has way too many cards to be played properly for my [ .. ] . this is going to stay on the shelf until she can play with all the cards
0	i bought the race cars to go on the speed and go racetrack . after shaking the cars , they do not even go around the racetrack once ! ! my boys still love the cars becasue of the way they look and the noise that they make . and boy do they make alot of noise ! they love to push the cars around the racetrack . it frustrates me becasue i bought several of these shake and go racecars that do not go around the track and use alot of batteries
0	i hate monopoly , but loved the idea of making my own game board . sadly , myoo had so many limitations ! i gave it a higher ed rating because you can turn the game into an educational one , but it is n't intrisically educational . it does n't print out spaces with color bars , just little green squares that you glue on the board below the pre-printed color bars . the background on everything you print is school bathroom green . you are stuck with lotto squares on the board ( bad for me since i believe gambling is evil ) . and you only have twelve good/bad news cards . i liked making my own money , though . i figured out how to do most of the same stuff in word . here 's how : i took the board from a `` your town '' clone of monopoly and measured between the big squares . i think the individual squares are 2.5 by 3.5 , but it does n't matter , since your board may be different . in word , i used a legal-sized paper ( i think that 's a5 for you brits ) and made a table that was nine columns that 's how many are on my board ) and two rows . then i messed with it to get the proportions correct . you can fit three rows on one sheet of legal paper , if the return is really small , like 5 points . that gives you space to cut . to get color bars , get your cursor in the top row . type any letter . then highlight it , go up to `` format '' and click on borders and shading . click on shading , click on a color , then make sure it says `` cell '' and not text or table . i use only 15 percent for most colors . click on ok and you should have a color bar . type in whatever text you want . then click below to type in your property name . on printing , i found the last squares were outside the printing range , so i will only have eight squares next time and will print a separate sheet for `` railroad '' squares . the corner squares are about 2.5 inches on my board . i would recommend you make them bigger , then trim to size , so you wo n't have any dead space on your board . cut and glue to a board you picked up at a thrift shop or yard sale and painted or covered . the property cards . these were actually easier than i thought . make a table one column wide and two rows deep . make it fill the whole page . color as above , and type in whatever you want . when you print them out , print out 8 or 16 pages to a sheet to get cards . for chance and community chest ... well , what i came up with was using mail merge and a shipping label template . you just print out on regular card or paper , and cut . the data file used for the merge would have your classy one-liners . i do n't know about putting graphics in . also , i ca n't figure out how to use merge . i did it once but ca n't figure it out now . money i have n't been able to do . i have quarkxpress and adobe pagemaker but do n't know how to use either program . plus , i wanted to make the money in paint or something simple . hope these directions help someone
0	the slides are awful and repetitive.my son had to keep asking me what they were pictures of ... and i could n't even answer him.i think the only thing he liked was when i turned the unit on without any slides and the light projected onto the ceiling.he thought that looked more like a moon that the acual slide did.huge disappointment ! ! ! and the base of the unit is worthless
1	this thing is great . anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off . it will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them ... funny funny funny ! ! ! ! you can use fairly light objects , you can use trip cords , and you can use trip cord like devices too , and probably much more that i have never thought of ... good luck , good fun , and good hunting ! sam kochel ... p.s . hope this was a helpful review
1	this is an awesome game . the fun thing about it is building it . its better than the rollercoasters because you dont just watch it going in circles . it actually does stunts . its also not so easy to . its very ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! durable . just keep it away from babies . you have to order it off the internet so dont go looking for it at stores . overall its an excellent toy
1	i was happy to order this early so they would n't run out , but i later saw the same set at a local store . there was only one left on the shelf , so i 'm glad i ordered them anyway . they are my youngest son 's favorite cars to start off with every morning
1	i recently bought this toy for my 2.5 year old daughter . she likes it and plays with it everyday . all the parts assembled easily - i did n't even use the directions . i have not had any trouble with parts falling off or breaking . it 's great to use an outside toy
0	normally i am a big fan of the little tikes name , but not so with this product . i bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and although the concept is cute , it is not like other little tikes products . to begin with , the train frequently comes off the track . also to activate it , you must press the button where the conductor goes . however , it is difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot without it falling off . she often presses the button in the process which activates the train while she is still trying to put the figure on it which frustrates her . since this is geared for toddlers , you would think that little tikes would have put the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where the figures go . also , at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it . she has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than riding on the track . needless to say , it is going back . the only good feature is that you can `` pack it and go '' for away from home fun
0	this was a cute product , but only lasted a day . perhaps my preschool boys ' punches were just too much for this bag . a patch was included , but it seems that air is leaking from the seams . oh well .
0	i was very happy to discover that i could purchase an asian cabbage patch girl doll ... it was for a little korean girl ... .the doll pictured on the website looked like the little girl that it was purchased for ( the hair ) . well , i was excited to find one and i wanted to make sure that i would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to texas in time for christmas . i ordered in on the 27th and received it on dec. 1st ( i paid for faster shipping ) . when i opened the box it was an asian doll but not the one with the ponytails ... this doll had short hair . i called amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it would n't happen again . i have used amazon before with no problems but i am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch . i should have read the other reviews . i will never let that happen again . beware ... do not order things of this nature from this website . you will be disappointed
1	a great way to save kids artwork . i use the pockets to organize by grade - it is great
1	my daughter received this for her 5th birthday and she absolutely loves it . it combines the classic board and memory games together . the pieces are made of very thick cardboard and are very durable . the only small complaint is the spinner which tends to get stuck easily . we have played this game multiple times each day since received and she is still excited everytime we open the box . an excellent game ! !
0	this is a very cute set however , it 's not very well made and the holders are free-standing so when a ball knocks against it they fall over . in regular croquet the wires are pushed into the ground so you do n't have that problem . with kids . . . the stands are knocked over frequently so you have to run over and set them back up in order for the game to continue . i would n't buy this set again if i had it to do over . disappointing
0	we bought these skates for our 5 year old . she could barely skate in them . they are too big and bulky for children just learning to skate . we returned them and have yet to find another pair
1	got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she `` played '' with , well more like laid and stared at . now she 's 4 1/2 months old and she still loves it . she loves to grab at the fish , shake the rattle and twirl the lobster . for awhile , it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it . great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat . also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom . music is n't too annoying either
0	if 0 stars were an option , that 's what i would have given this awful product . does n't work anything like they show on tv . so sticky , messy , and slimy , and the smell is just awful . i did n't even want my kids to touch it because of the terrible chemical smell . i find it hard to believe they can label this product `` non-toxic '' . total false advertising . do not buy this mess
1	this is the first game i 've tried by the venerable reiner knizia . i was really taken in by the combination of simple rules , but interesting strategy . since then , i 've purchased several of his games . for those who like lost cities , but also have a soft spot for poker , try battleline . samurai is a great introduction to the sometimes complicated world of `` tile games '' , with tigres and euphrates being the much more complicated cousin ( although again , the rules are n't that complicated ... the difficulty comes via strategic decision making . ) so far , my all time favorite knizia game ... and frankly , one of my favorite games period , is modern art . the game mechanics are fairly simple , easily explained in 5 minutes , with some of the more complex bidding rules explained in a trial game . essentially , it 's a game about playing an auction ... who is the best at playing the market , guessing at art values , and spending money wisely . it 's also a true crossover game ... non-gamers , or those only exposed to the standard monopoly , trivial pursuit , etc , will quickly learn how much fun it can be ... and will probably be asking to play again
0	if you are looking to add a microphone to your product then just purchase the microphone , not the microhpone with these two books . if you purchase this item then you are limited to these two books ! ! if you purchase the microphone you can use all microphone enhanced books ! ! ! my kids love the microphone . it is great to hear their own voice and sounds . i give the microphone itself 5 stars
1	this product was delivered fast ... ... .it was so easy to install ... ... .and the light is a pretty blue just like the picture . when the light is on it does not show up as well
0	the dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea . the only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself . i wish the case closed more tightly , it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily . overall tho , aside from the annoyance of the lid , for the price it was still worth purchasing because as i 've said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my 8yr old daughters polly collection .
0	our boy doll arrived without a nose ! fisher price will not give us a new doll to replace the broken doll . do n't waste your money ! ! ! ! !
1	i just got the laser tag master blaster a few days ago and i love it . i 've had my eye on it ever since i got the deluxe for my b-day back in september . i was looking on amazon so frequently for the price to drop that i got tired of watching so i stopped for a few months . then spring came and i got into playing laser tag again with my little brother . i was suddenly filled with an urge to buy the ltmb . i looked back on amazon and ... boom ! 60 percent off ! 20 bucks ! i told my mom and dad about it and they said that i could get one . so the next day we began the ordering process on amazon , through toys r us . we checked the shipping charges and ... bam ! 15 greens ! so we just figured on our next trip into town we could just go to toys r us and see if it would be the same price . it was ( minus the 15 bones for s ) . so we picked up a few and went home . after reading the instructions a million times and doing a few tests i finally figured out how they work . i also found out that they are very much like the deluxe , except for the shoulder stock , the sights , the fully automatic feature , the 3 shot burst , the shot range , the text messages , and who could ever forget the rocket . let me explain the laser tag master blaster to you : this large tagger is much better for a very large playing field . the deluxe and the irt-2x models are better for smaller areas . the ltmb 's laser has a shot range of up to one thousand feet . the laser has three different shot types : the single ( fire one shot ) , the 3-burst ( fire a burst of 3 shots , no overheatage ) , and the fully automatic ( fire non-stop ) . you can also send text messages ( up to 10 characters long ) to your teammates and opponents . retreat ... behind you ... gotcha ... ouch ! the rocket is awesome . just load , pump , and launch , simple as that . with just twenty pumps the rocket can sail over forty feet , blasting everyone in a 15 to 20 foot radius . there is a lot more to the ltmb but it would take to long to type , so you 'll just have to figure it out for yourself .
1	our son plays with this board while i 'm feeding him . he 's only 20 months , but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him . it 's well built . arrived in only a couple days . our son loves it !
1	vakama is very cool.you must get him ! he wears the great mask of concelment and comes with a kanoka disk
0	i bought this toy for my five year old daughter . her three year old sister and her loved to play with it for about thirty seconds . my five year old finally asked if it could go away because she was tired of putting it back together . her ponies now live in the strawberry shortcake house with her ... .
0	this is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child . there are only two working buttons , one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker . there is some padding on the top , but not enough . the manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added . overall not a good value at all for the price .
0	my 3 year old got this for a christmas gift , and i thought it to be a great idea , since he loves elmo and bathtime . wrong ... the darn crayons stained my bathtub ! ! i had to scrub my tub for what seemed like forever to get the stains `` almost '' out . i threw the crayons away after that . my son likes the elmo still , but i would n't recommend the crayons , especially in an older-style porcelain bathtub , like ours
0	ancient sanctuary throws lots of unique cards at us . first , fairy decks start to rise from the junk pile in the corner of your room . zombies finally have an 1800 attacker . machines have a mean burn monster . the rares are something else . soul resurrection is a call of the haunted except the monster goes into defence mode . and it 's only a rare ! there is also blowback dragon , who like his brother , barrel dragon , has the same effect . instead of destroying monsters only , blowback destroys any card on the field . zaborg the thunder monarch is also a plus to this set , destroying any monster on the field when summoned . i got this 5 set and got gear golem , the moving fortress , enemy controller , draining shield , zaborg the thunder monarch and avatar of the pot . in other words , buy it . this is worth the money
0	this game is heavily developed based on the actual movie . if you have n't seen the movie , and/or your kid was too young to understand the plot , then they might not get the game . most of the adventures are based on the story plot . a lot of the adventures are a bit dumb , like mcqueen bumping alphabet tires into a truck , mcqueen tipping over the tractors based on counting smoke rings , mcqueen herding the tractors back into the pen , mcqueen driving down a long road and picking up shapes , mcqueen driving down a road looking for mack based on memory , mcqueen dodging the firetruck water blast , etc . the only adventure i liked was the forklift picking up tire numbers ( odd vs. even ) and installing them on the race car . do n't buy this game unless your kid is obsessed with cars
1	my girls love the sandbox ! the only thing my husband and i do n't like is that you can not move it once the sand is in it . we thought we 'd be able to , but the walls are just flimsy enough that you ca n't . otherwise , a great purchase
0	i bought this thinking it was going to be really cool , but it was very boring and stupid . it contains 3 puzzles all of which a 5 yr old can do and the games are the most stupid games ever . the one with the spinner only shows the objects on the puzzle move smaller as you look at it . thats the whole thing . your pupil is just going back to its smaller , regular size and it makes the picture look like it 's getting smaller . and the one with the magic cards is rediculous . anyone can see that all you have to do is choose the cards that you can see the character you chose through . very disapointing . i wish i could have seen the box before i bought it . then i would have seen just how lame this was
0	this is a very mediocre knights kingdom set . there 's not much of interest going on here , and the small castle suffers from lazy design . the colorful knights of morcia are back , once again fighting against vladek , the black knight . two of the good knights make an appearance here ( blue and purple ) , and we also get vladek , a dark soldier , and a skeleton . the minifigs are as charismatic as ever , each sporting his own unique expression . vladek and his henchman have that cute `` i 'm evil '' lego frown . our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories . swords and shields , and a black hatchet for the henchman . the scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster . the creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and technic parts , and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers . the blue knight is accompanied by his horse , who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side . the scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle , which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered . high atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it . the rest of the castle is just walls , floors , and a staircase . this castle is very fragile . mine fell apart several times while i was working on building it . on the whole , the design just is n't all that great . handle with care , and play with care . colors are mostly black , dark gray , dark red , and brown . this set has one of those nice walls with the barred window , and some signature knights kingdom battlement pieces . this set works as an addition to vladek 's dark fortress . on its own , it 's stunningly less impressive . the good news is that a savvy lego maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them . my verdict : one thumb up for the scorpion monster ( who can be added to your other knights kingdom adventures ) , one thumb down for the rest . could 've been better . my advice is to get vladek 's dark fortress . it 's more than worth the price of admission . for those still hungering for more knights kingdom action after vladek 's fortress has been built and conquered , this set is better than nothing
0	this item looks great in theory , but it just is n't worth it . the pegs are made in all different sizes - some fall out , some do n't fit in , and some stick out too far , leaving you with a messy look to your lite art . one of the crayons for the neon was broken when received , but it did n't matter , since it just looked like a regular crayon drawing on black paper anyway . if you do buy this item , be sure to purchase that 25w light bulb that is n't even included
1	we have this product and love it ! at first we had a problem with the hooves not working . i called the number on the box . they were wonderful and sent me new hooves at no expense or item return . then i find it was user error ! santa did n't realize there were buttons in the heel of the hoof that push down when walking . i called the company back and they told me not to worry about the exta hooves they sent . to enjoy . i would order from them again
1	i gave this game to my 13 year old nephew for christmas . he actually wrote me a thank you note for it . in the note he said `` i like it better than normal monoply . there 's a lot more thinking and strategy involved '' . i might even go up to five stars
0	i hate to write a bad review- i think it 's actually the first one i 've ever written . this was a gift from my husband 's work christmas party for our 2-year old . the extension on the pole is a stiff plastic piece and does n't stay extended so that you can catch the fish ; it folds back on itself . so our son was n't able to catch anything with it . it would be better if the extension did n't bend at all , but just stayed in one place , and even if it did that i would n't buy it . it 's more fun to have a pole with a string so you can reel it in
1	my son loves this toy . it is the perfect height for my 14 month old ( he got it when he was 12 months , and it was great then , too ) . he can play with it sitting or standing . he loves to make baskets , and i can teach him numbers as the scoreboard keeps his score . he loves to spin the football , and he is starting to gain enough coordination to hit the ball with the bat . he uses the bat it came with to hit other balls around the house . this toy is a family favorite
1	my 9 month old received this for christmas and loves it ! he is not quite crawling yet , he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy . so far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze . the voice and phrases it says are so very cute too , we love the little giggle and when it says `` hello baby '' ! ! this is an adorable toy
1	i purchased this house for my in home day care . so we have lots of toddlers playing with it ! they love it ! the only complaint i have is that the door falls off easily if the child pushes it instead of pulls it . but the kids all fit in there and even bring chairs . even the one year old loves it ! he likes to play peek a boo with the shutters . lots of fun and well worth the money
1	this is a fabulous little brio bridge . my kids ( 6 , 3 2 yrs ) all love this as part of their train track . it is a sturdy piece which gets used daily . my kids love that they can drive the train onto the bridge and then push the button that collapses the bridge and have the train ( mostly this is diesel 10 ) fall down . it 's a reenactment of the viaduct scene from thomas and the magic railroad movie
0	this stuff is greasy and hard to wipe off tables and fingers . it 's good for older kids who can keep their fingers on the paper but not good for little ones who smush their fingers into the wax and get it all under their finger nails on the table , chairs and walls .
1	i also found this item at target for $ 39.99 . if you buy it at amazon or ebay , your wasting your money
0	the case is a cheaply made box of wood that did not even survive shipping . the materials contained inside are poor quality . the rating does not deserve one star . i returned it due to the damage sustained in shipping , but it would have been returned regardless because it is garbage !
1	this is a fun version of battleship . and the nice part is being able to play against the game
1	my daughter ( 15 months ) literally started running in place with excitement when she opened this baby doll , which was a gift from my best friend . i 've never seen her react like this to any gift . my daughter has continued to bring this baby doll around with her everywhere -- usually she just ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware . the doll has a soft , squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that she has , as my husband is constantly saying , `` a hard plastic head . ''
0	i had this sent to my little brother and they threw away the packaging before discovering that they recieved a broken unit , and of course they did n't tell me in a timely fashion . shoddy merch is not cool , anything we can do to swap it out is fine , but being over 30 days i guess you win
1	truly wonderful ! my 4 year old son has n't quit playing this game since christmas
0	i purchased this product along with the koi and turtle and they worked for one day . the koi would not turn off unless the batteries were pulled out . the turtle would not turn on unless you physically held the button in and the fish just quit altogether and sunk to the bottom of the pool .
1	i think this toy is just too cute . it is a bit pricey though . i would not suggest you purchase this toy for a young toddler ... maybe a 2 1/2 to 3 year old . my daughter likes throwing it on the ground and screaming with delight ( she is one and a half ) . she really likes it and carries it around the house . she is a little too young to respect it properly and i fear it may not last long . it is really cute if you have real stainless steal appliances in your home . i bought this because my daughter has taken a keen interest in my microwave and i have trouble keeping her away from it . this toy has solved that problem . one minus is that it came with no instructions on how to get the table to rotate . you have to play with the buttons a little and then you will see how it operates . my daughter can not systematically make the turn table rotate ... for her it happens randomly . she enjoys opening the doors , pushing the buttons , seeing the light come on and hiding her real dinner in there ( so parents beware ! ) . someone suggested it is a tiny unit ... and so it is , but all the other toy microwaves i looked at were very similar in size
1	i received this sudoku handheld for christmas as a gift . i started to get into sudoku a few months ago . while i still like to clip out the newspaper clipping , this handheld lets me take my growing gaming addiction on the go . there are n't many buttons so it 's pretty intuitive on what to push to make it work . hope this helps
1	i bought this sand box for my son 's 1st birthday . he has had the sand box for a month and loves it . it looks really nice in our yard and the top has kept out rain and bugs . i was going to go with a cheaper sand box , but now i 'm glad i spent the money . this is a very good product !
1	what a wonderful toy . the no volume control worried me , but it is n't that loud . great value , great toy
0	this was very cheaply made . i was disappointed in it 's quality . also , it comes apart constantly . all my daughter has to do is barely touch it and it comes all apart . i am going to try to glue the pieces in place so she can at least play with it . we have many barbie toys and this is by far the worst i have ever purchased . not to mention that is was expensive ! i expected much , much better quality from a barbie product
1	it was what i expected and it came in time for my grandsons birthday
1	my son wanted this piece and we have enough of the other pieces to incorpate it into the track system we have started and my son loves it and plays with it so i have to say it has exceeded my expectation for the value it added to our geo trax railroad
1	we bought this set for my seven year old boy and we were a bit dissapointed . there are better magic kits out there for the price for older children . ( look at the marshal broden kits by cadaco ) . if you have a young child is is four and five though this is a great set . the tricks are easy to work and they are big for small hands . anyone who has any magic sets or tricks though will find this too simplistic and not as exciting as many of the other kits .
0	all the above comments are so true ! i ca n't believe the prices on amazon . i too have been running back and forth to walmart , kohls , kb toys trying to get the whole collection . i am also missing chick.. but , i wo n't resort to these tactics . the normal selling price is $ 3.99 - these sellers should be ashamed ! ! !
1	as a mother of 5 , this toy has proven to be one of my favorites of all time . my son received it for christmas ( at age 2 months ) and it has been wonderful . we place it in his bed at naps and at night , and he goes to sleep watching and listening to it . when he wakes up , it is there for him to play with . as he has grown ( he is now 7 months ) , he has become increasingly more interested in the sounds and textures of the toy , and now puts the corners in his mouth which has helped with teething . i have been impressed with the sound quality ( it is not annoying like most musical children 's toys ) and i will be anxious to see if it causes my son to love music on a different level . love this toy !
1	my 9 month-old granddaughter likes her christmas present of octotune ; as a matter of fact , we played with this toy yesterday when i stayed with her . it is colorful , she can grab the legs and the music is pleasing , so it stimulates more than one sense .
0	very dangerous ! my daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike . the handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over . there is only one good thing about it . the seat puts the child higher than the pedals and they can use their weight to get it going . this helped my daughter learn to pedal . the constant nose dive however ... .was not worth it . do n't buy !
1	my 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a lot of use out of this toy . it is a strong microphone and seems to be made very well . they love to pretend to be rock stars ! my only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control ... . so you only get one level ... loud . i would recommend it for any child that likes to sing
1	now you can add risk to your libary in this handsome bookshelf edition . the game remains a perennial favorite , and in this day and age of global conquest you can play out your vicarious need to be king of the world without harming anyone , atleast not physically . but , be prepared for a few bruised egos , especially when combatants start teaming up on weaker victims . while the places and names do n't exactly match today 's geographical boundaries , kids can still get some sense of the world in which we live , even if the object of the game remains to wipe each other out
1	my kids love this game . they sit down together and play this game all of the time . the neighbor kids come over to our house because they love to play board games and sorry is the one they choose the most . we do not have video games at our house , and this was considered a drawback to the neighbor kids until my kids introduced them to board games . now they come over all of the time just to play board games . i say hide the video games and let the kids interact with each other playing board games . sorry is top game in our house
1	my son , who is 3 , loves dinosaurs and everything green . this toy was perfect . the dinosaur comes in green and red . i bought green for my son and gave the red one to his cousin . they have dino wars . this dinosaur moves , roars , and flashes its eyes red , which looks really cool in the dark . my son flys it around the room uses it to attack other toys . this proved to be a such agreat toy , i bought another ( # 2 ) green dino to have my son and husband have dino fights . this toy is the best i have found .
1	my niece could n't put this down after she opened it . she had lots of fun doing tricks for her relatives at christmas . the components of the set are very good quality . i patted myself on the back for discovering this `` winner '' gift
0	my daughter loves the van but can rarely use it all alone ! the doors pop off the babies fall out of their seats the stroller gets stuck on the roof rack ( an elastic band ) and the seat belts are just annoying ! i ca n't even buckle them all up ! needless to say she still wants to play with it
0	... this is nothing like the spirograph i grew up playing with . as everyone else mentioned , the gears are much too thin and slip constantly . my 6 year old son was completely frustrated after wrestling with the design flaws . do n't waste your money !
0	do not waste your money . my son was so excited to get floam . he had been asking for it for a very long time . finally i gave in and bought it . it is like little pellets in green slime . it is so wet and slimy that it is not possible to mold it into anything . and you ca n't stick it to anything like they show in the commercials because once you thouch it it is hard to get the slimy mess of off your hands . it is very messy and impossible to play with . the commercials are very misleading .
1	bought for 2 year old twins ... it held up with about 5 kids in it and even an adult at the birthday party . the only thing that does n't appear to be the greatest is the detachable steering wheel because with my kids it would end up missing in no time . definitely a great gift .
0	to start with , the description of this kit is false . there are not 75 pieces ... only 11 . the detail is very , very poor ... large soft-edged raised blocks with only the vaguest resemblance to the death star as seen in the films . you 'd honestly be better off starting with a smooth plastic ball making a death star from scratch , rather than buying this kit .
0	my grandson loved this toy because of the sounds and the lights . a month later it was n't working at all . we thought it was the batteries and changed them , but sure enough nothing was working . we called tonka and then they passed us off to the company that manufactures them ... p.s . i still have n't heard from them and it 's been almost 5 months . it 's not worth the money ! i highly recommend you buy some other brand of firetruck for your lil'firefighter
0	i had a feeling that this toy would be trouble when i saw the delivery guy walking up to our front steps with a weird grin on his face . evidently , the box had been vrooming , vibrating and shrieking throughout his rounds , and he was only too glad to end his term as its temporary steward . my two-year-old has largely lost interest in this toy ; he does n't mind the shaking and noise , but more often than not it just vrooms and then does n't go anywhere . my advice : buy matchbox , or hot wheels ... or something more reliable with volume control . this will probably be in our next load of donations ... thrift shoppers beware .
1	she 's a beautiful doll . i love the blonde ponytail and the make-up is fine . i even like the jeans . but why the ugly white untucked shirt and the super-short pink sweater ? ? ? it just looks takcy to me . if i buy her she will be wearing a new shirt right away . other than that she 's a lovely doll . and i , like the previous reviewer , also remember and love the archie comics from my childhood . a 5 star doll except for the shirt
0	i bought this carry case for my son 's l-max . it works well for carrying the unit and all the games he has for it . i would n't advise dropping it on a hard surface of any sort . it is not nearly padded enough to be carrying a hand held gaming unit of any sort . my son likes to take his l-max to school with him for mornings before school begins . i place it in the carrying case and then place the carrying case inside of his backpack to give it some extra cushioning . if i had known how little padding there was in this particular carrying case i probably would n't have bought it . there is a carrying case out for the nintendo wii that is similar in style but much more padded . i almost purchased it but then thought that i should get something designed for the leapster l-max . if i had it to do over i would have purchased the case for the wii . it might have been a little big but the extra padding would have made up for it . overall , it is not a bad purchase but for the money you should get something a little more protective . after all , the leapster starts at $ 69.99 and the price goes up accordingly for the l-max
1	i bought it for my grandson who is 4 , but my granddaughter liked it better then he did and she is only a year old , she kept hugging it and trying to dance with it
0	the rechargeable battery lasted for approx . 5 minutes once fully charged . after five minutes it did not have enough power to allow the air hog to fly . i would not recommend this as a buy .
1	my seven month old thinks the pots and pans are the best thing ever , and i 'd definitely rather he bang on the plastic ones than real ones . but i have to say that the songs are a little irritating and i find them running through my head when i 'm trying to sleep
0	i was anxious to get this game for my daughter for christmas , as she loves all princess things . unfortunately , the instructions were so confusing ( do they even test these games ? with real people ? ) , we quickly grew disenchanted with it , and tossed it . quality is not top notch , and the instructions and actual game concept are poorly thought out
1	as a brilliant , but ruthless leader of the piraka , zaktan thinks that working together is the way to find the ultimate treasure , the mask of life ! all the piraka have two tools . yes , 2 . each one has a zamor spheres which are small marbles that each one can shoot , but in real life they would be the size of basketballs . zaktan 's three-pronged blade is capable of cutting through metal . nothing will get in his way , or it will be severely punished ... ... ... ... ... .
1	i just got my tamagotchi last week and my cousin couldnt stop holding it . he fed and played with it everytime.it got sick every minute because my cousin kept feeding him.one day my cousin had wet hands and touched my tamagotchi toy.it died for a week i had to get it fixed.i wish you made the tamagotchi v4 waterproof .
1	i bought these for my nephew as a birthday present and he absolutely loved it . he has a number of other sets bu was very excited with the content in this one . they were exactly what he wanted
1	bought this for our girls , 2 and 4 . huge hit , even before the batteries were put in the blow dryer . this set is great for several reasons , and i 'll try to list the top few . first , the dryer actually has a little fan in it that whirrs loudly enough to seem real , but not so loud as to disturb the cat when she is getting her fur done . ( uncommon for a kid 's toy ) also , the nail polish and eyeshadow are both made to open and `` use '' , but no mess . and once you have removed the inner packing materials , the bag is large enough for headband and tiara storage . a must for today 's princess . the one thing i will caution you about is the curling iron . if your child has longer hair like my girls do , it can get tangled when hair is being `` curled '' . fortunately , the curler has no moving parts , so tangles are discovered long before any permanent damage is done . all in all , a pretty sturdy little set for $ 15 . great for practice make-overs and such , but probably not for experienced princesses , as there is no actual make-up involved , just imagination . perfect for my house ! no glittery door handles or perfumed pets !
1	no bells , no whistles -- just an action figure with its ' own four-wheeler . it can capture the mind of a car-obsessed 6 year old boy for an hour at a time at least : - ) some of the objects that the action figure is supposed to hold do n't stay in his hand very well , but oh well -- it seems that all my nephew wanted to do was crach the thing anyway ! and it takes that quite well .
0	my 4 year old really wanted this for christmas , after looking at similar products , we chose this one . should have spent the money on the one w/the dvd . tutu is way too small - fits her 18 '' doll . mat is a little too sensitive , she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads . only 2 instructions - feet up , feet down . on the other arms up , arms down . bar is n't very stable . company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat . my daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it .
0	my friends and i ( all over 21 , for reference ) sat down to play this one day and we just could not find this game interesting or fun or amusing in the least . i 'm not sure what is needed to make this fun or challenging ... but none of us could make it past 15 minutes of play . it will not be brought out again
1	my 2 year old daughter ( and our 4 6 year old neighbors ) love this toy ! i had it up during my daughter 's second birthday party and all the kids loved it ! it holds up very well and i have only had to refill it once ( and that was only because one of the kids managed to pull out the plug ) . some of the balls are not 100 % inflated but they still roll just fine and my daughter has the best time with this . it is up in the living room and not outside so that keeps it from getting any other holes . i would recommend this for any kids around 4 or under . the one thing to keep in mind ; the kids may be afraid of it at first ; my daughter was terrified of it the first day but by the second she loved it and now she spends a lot of time in there
0	these figures look pretty decent at first glance but when you take them out of the box you see how bad they really are . my superman broke in half ( at the waist ) when i took him out of the box ! add that to the fact that there are only an average of six points of articulation on each ( only three on wonder woman ! ) and you see that these are n't very high quality figures . amazo is transparent , which makes no sense whatsoever . he is n't an invisible character . i also do n't like that , while superman 's s and belt stick out from his uniform , bizarro 's are merely painted on . only buy this item if you love doomsday and its on sale . it 's not worth its list price by a long shot
1	this is a great game for two players ( and two players only ) . the first one or two times i played , it was very , very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in . however , once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you , games tend to take about an hour . it 's a fairly involved game , so you have to be in the mood for that . there 's a lot of strategy and many ways to win . i greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games . it might be daunting for a really casual gamer , though . if you like it , there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original
1	my son saved and bought this with his own money . very durable , great for catching practice my son is always in the yard playing with it
1	my little boy is a certified dino-phile , to the point where he 's had to teach me to pronounce several dinosaur names ( ever tried saying edmontonsaurus three times fast ? ) . but , like any kid , his favorite remains the t-rex , tyrant lizard king . when it comes to his numerous dinosaur toys , this is the most durable by far . although we 've had the same problems getting this to stand at times , as mentioned by another reviewer , that has n't diminished my son 's enjoyment . to top it off , he 's come up with fun new uses for the toy , too . that catapult is very good at aiming at our family cat , much to my son 's delight
1	i bought the little tikes adjust and jam basketball set for my grandson 's 4th birthday . it is perfect for his age group . the height can be raised or lowered and comes with 2 small size basketballs . he loves it
1	my 8 yr old grandson wanted this for christmas but the price was over $ 100 so when i saw it for under $ 15 on amazon , i got it for his birhtday in february . he and his 9 yr old brother love it ! i also purchased one booster pack at the same time . then i found another game and booster pack at target for a very reasonable price . so he got the game system , two games and two booster pack of cards all for under $ 50.00 ! both he and i were happy ! ( the only reason i give this a `` 4 '' is because the games are a bit hard to come by
0	i do not usually take the time to write reviews on products . if i am not satisfied with something i would return it and write a reason for the return . the kids used this product up in about an hour so there was n't much to send back . when i was a kid we had spirograph and it was a great thing . the reviews for the current model said that spirograph was just a memory and the new one was a cheap copy that did n't work . i am glad that the reviews were there for that product . to save money i ordered this low cost spin doodles toy . five year old kids are always excited to open a toy to check it out . i played with them for a little while to get them started and realized that we had a box of junk . why would someone go through the trouble to develope and manufacture a toy and then sell it on the internet when it is not really usable ? the gears and holder for the paper were a mess of poorly designed and warped plastic . at least the cost was low . this one was a waste of shipping cost even if the toy was free . i hope this helps someone who remembers spirograph and what a great creative toy it was 35 to 40 years ago . i guess the technology has been lost for toys with plastic gears .
1	my son got this for his 5th birthday and he loves it ! he likes to turn off the lights and give `` shows '' for the family . we have not listened to the cds yet but i am sure they are a great add-on . my son is fascinated by space adn this porjector was a cool way for him to learn even more . i do n't know if they revamped the design or someting but we love it and have no complaints . in fact , we are going to purchase some of the other packs available
1	the item arrived in perfect condition and right when i was told it would be here . i am very happy with this product and seller . would have no problem doing busy with them agai
0	i was really excited about this toy because it was a stacking and sorting toy in one . and i love laugh and learn toys . i got it for my daughter for christmas when she was 16 months old . she never liked it . i kept it out and encouraged her to play with it , but she just really did n't get into it . also , there is a sticker that goes on the bottom of the top pot so you can see the shapes through the holes on the lid , and the sticker shapes do n't match the holes ! unfortunately , this toy was a big let down .
0	a waste of my hard to come by money -- - i am on a fixed income and bought this item for my 10 month old grandson for christmas . really a disappointment , good idea-but he ca n't even hear the animal sounds because they are so low ... .. if i could have taken it away from him , i definitely would have returned it for a refund ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	this play tent is great - my son got it when he was 1 and still loves it a year later . he brings toys in there and `` hides '' to play . it is not unsafe , it will tip over at times , but it 's so lightweight that it could not hurt him . i think that it 's a great buy for the money and would recommend it
0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece . we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks . be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer . the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive
1	we looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old . the nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around . we can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side . we do n't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable . i would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily , squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries . i would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water
0	luckily i had one of the 9.6 volt batteries around and saved myself 20 dollars , after placing the battery in which is no easy task , he has to walk behind it to get it to go , the range is terrible , why is there no antenna on the vehicle also ? too bad i threw the box away xmas morning , now i 'm out 49.99 . live and lear
1	my 23-month old son received this toy for christmas and it was one of his favorites . he played with it off and on for hours . woke up this morning and ran right to it . it is n't very educational but the fact that he recognizes the songs from the show makes it more fun . it 's not too bulky so it 's something we can take in the car . overall , we love it and would recommend it to any wiggles fan ; -
0	extremely disappointing . bought the toy for my son for christmas . it did n't come with the battery ( $ 30 extra ) and the battery is still sold out everywhere , including online , almost a month later . do n't bother . there are lots of other great rc toys out there
1	my son is currently 4 months old , and this is currently his favorite toy . he loves to watch it , hold it , and chew on it with his gums
1	my son absolutely loves his `` animals '' . he can sit and play with the book for awhile . he 's 20 months old and knows where each picture belongs . it was a great gift and i recommend it ! i do agree with the other reviews regarding the dinosaurs .
1	we have several boxes of these melissa and doug bead sets b/c we just ca n't get enough of them ! my three children ( twin boys - one girl ) love to sit and make necklaces over and over again ! yes ! my boys love this too ! ! ! it 's a great exercise for their fine motor skills ! the patience they have all developed to sit and string these small beads together is wonderful ! it 's great practice for them as they create different patterns with each new necklace . i suggest getting a few boxes - especially if you have more than one child playing with them at the same time . our favorite set includes letters so they can each spell out their own name or other words . **not suggested for small children who will mistake them for pieces of candy .
1	the children in our after school program love this puzzle . the colors are beautiful and they are learning about different sea creatures at the same time
0	i am a parent of a 9 year old daughter who loves dolls . she was given the love me chou chou doll for christmas ( 12/25/05 ) . on christmas day we were unable to get the doll to fall asleep , so on 12/26/05 i went back to the store to exchange the doll . with no luck i found that the second doll would not fall asleep either . i looked on the zapf-creation web-site under most frequently asked questions and received more instructions on how to get the doll to fall asleep and still the doll will not fall asleep . apparently this is a problem , not only with the doll my daughter has but with other customers as well . if the company knows that this is one of the most frequently asked questions , why not remodel the doll so she can fall asleep like the instructions say ? it is very discouraging for a 9 year old who has hopes of seeing the doll do something that is being advertised and it does not do that . it is also very upsetting to a parent who has to continue going back and forth to a store and hopes of looking for a working doll . these dolls are very expensive and should work like the instructions say they should . we have tried everything we can to get the love me chou chou doll to fall asleep and nothing seems to make that happen.. i have even spoken with another parent in the store where the doll was purchased and was advised her daughter also was crying on christmas day because they could not get the doll to fall asleep . she then explained , she had her mother a grandmother to rock the doll and guess what the doll finally fell asleep keep in mind this was not rock-a-bye chou chou . we have even tried to rock this doll with no luck of getting the doll to fall asleep . i have even taken the doll back to the store for an exchange , but was advised the doll is no longer being sold at the store where i purchased it .
1	just as promised . our son loves the wiggles plate , bowl and cup ! perfect
1	i purchased the mat to use with it and it works great
1	this is the optimus prime that should have been made 20 years age . it was a difficult decision whether to open it or save it in the original packaging . finally nostalgia won out and i had to transform him . it was amazing . the transformation took time but it was worth the wait . i felt like a kid again . i am totally satified with this product .
1	i bought four of these for my husabnd , son in law , daughter and myself for christmas . i wrapped a bag of marshmallows for each of them and gave them the wrapped guns and marshmallows on christmas eve . the second they opened the marshmallows they knew what was in the box . they ripped into them and were shooting each other like crazy . they had a blast ! i will tell you that the marshmallows do hurt at close range when the gun is pumped way up . my dogs loved it too . they ate all the marshmallows that fell to the floor . well , not all of them..i did find some in the christmas tree and on the bookshelves . ( yes they played with them in the house . ) one trick ... to get the marshmallows to shoot really well , we genlty rolled them in our hands from side to side to make the mallow just a bit skinnier . stale marshmallows work great too
0	i ordered the doll because it said it will swim when put in water . when i recieved the doll it was just a barbie . it is not the swimming mermaid .
1	i bought my son this toy after reading all the bad reviews.i agree that you cant reach all the buttons in the time allocated but he loves it and watches it move round the room . i recommend this product for 9 month olds
0	this is junk , cheap plastic , no instructions , arrived with some pieces broken ( not in shipping ) ; much better products available for the cost . from the description , i expected a much better product . this is not it ; a bargain at 1/3 the price , maybe
1	i received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it . the price is great right now , especially with free shipping . she loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories . more than worth the low price ... i 'm going to stock up on a few more for misc . gifts . the package is large and comes with a lot of accessories
0	i got this for my eight year old . unfornately i read the reviews on amazon just before he opened it , not before i bought it . this is a great idea very poorly implemented . i am completely dissappointed , and if i had not bought it at a final clearance sale ... would be bringing it back . my son 's previous method of holding a piece of paper over what he wants to copy and then taping them to a well lit window is much better and cheaper
0	our 3 year old son just loves hot wheels cars . this transporter , however , is not one of his favorites . it 's easy to see why . the back is difficult to lower , with it being controlled by a very small button on the bottom of the trailer . who ever thought of this design for a child ? it 's also very easy for the child to accidentally get his fingers caught in the trailer when lowering it . the cones and barrels are easily lost and the storage of them in the trailer is badly designed . they have a small piece of plastic that `` locks '' in the barrels or cones which is impossible for a child to figure out . i 'd recommend passing on this toy if you have a child in the 3-5 year old range .
0	i was rather disappointed with both doll tv and the item . the coin looks like it was made of cheap plastic . i have toddler toys made of the same material . the packaging is also very cheap and childish for a limited edition collectible . i was certainly expecting a lot more for a limited edition replica which costs $ 25.00 . when i contaced doll tv to discuss the item , i was told that this was `` an exact prop replica of the coin necklace worn in the movie '' and that they would refund my shipping costs if i removed my comments . i did n't even pay for shipping !
1	insta sundae in a can : simply take the can and squirt some of the stuff into a bowl , cover it in whipped creamand chocolate sauce , put a cherry on top and , voila , you 've instantly created a sundae
0	when i received the punching nun and removed her from the package , her halibut fell off , the glue holding her black cape on did n't hold either . i would n't buy another product through this company if this is the type of merchandise they are shipping . save your money and go to your local mall novelty store and pick one up .
0	my daughter is almost three , and she was so excited when she received this for christmas . unfortunately , the strings do not work , and also the star buttons are supposed to play notes and/or chords , and they do n't work , either . i was going to send for a replacement because my daugher absolutely loves this , and i was so disappointed when amazon responded there are no replacements available . i 'm going to see if the manufacturer can replace it
1	if you know the movies inside and out , this game is fun for the dedicated fan . i play with my son that knows so much more star wars trivia than i do but find the game enjoyable . the only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times , the dvd portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck . not sure why they could not load up more questions on the dvd but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old mom that answers so many questions wrong
0	this says it is a wooden dollhouse but is not worth the money - is cheesy looking and cheaply made
1	my son ( 5 year old ) chose this toy as his reward and was so excited when he received it . he and his brother and dad enjoy countless hours of pretend play as they are all star wars fans . it has a realistic appearance and the sound is not irritating as are many toy guns . highly recommended
0	i bought this table for my almost 8 month old who is starting to pull up on things . i thought this would be safe for her to learn to stand with because it has hand grippers along the sides of the table ( just for that purpose ) and is recommended for ages 6 months+ . all of the fun shapes , colors , and sounds immediately caught her attention . she cawled over to it and when she tried to pull herself up it fell over ontop of her . she bumped her head and cried , but fortunately , was n't hurt . i put a rug under it thinking maybe that would help make it more stable , but as soon as she tried to pull up again ( within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box ) it fell over on her again . the top of the table is very heavy , but the legs are not very sturdy , making it topheavy and easy to topple . needless to say , i took it back to the store . i would not recommend this toy unless you only wanted to take the legs off and use it on the floor , or if you have a toddler who is very steady at standing on his own . personally , i think the recommended age should be changed for older children or this toy should be recalled and the legs redesigned .
0	here in america , lindsay lohan is what many call a conspiracy . lindsay lohan is not a `` beloved collector 's item '' . she 's a bulimic spoiled brat . she 's also , weird . myscene has made the biggest marketing mistake of their life . lindsay lohan went from cute child star to bulimic brat in a milisecond . she thinks she can sing , and she ca n't . she thinks she can do a romantic comedy , and she ca n't . ( just my luck , was not `` lucky '' ) i bet not even a million bought this doll from a cheap knock-off of the barbie line . you 'd only buy your child this doll if you want them to idolize a young woman who has thrown her life away
1	i looked for years to get the bozo punching bag as it was a part of my youth . finally i located it and purchased it for my grandson , 7 . he loves it as does all of his family who use it to take out their frustrations . lol built very sturdy as he drags it around the backyard as well
0	i ordered the smack and yack : disney cars sally , lightning and ramone for christmas . the only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was ramone . sally and lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour , they would n't work at all . i ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on christmas . i hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases
1	i bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt available in stores . my daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll . doll speaks both english and spanish . the only thing i dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals , but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth . its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest
0	my 7 year old son received the giga ball for christmas . it was a big hit . he and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours . unfortunately , the very next day , it pretty much fell apart . i did n't expect it would last very long , but had hoped that it would last more than one day
1	i played `` atmosfear , the harbingers '' on vhs in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay . then , i saw this dvd update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down . here 's my judgement : 1 ) the mechanics have been simplified . this has it 's pros and cons . it could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components . 2 ) the gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the dvd update . 3 ) it is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed . one reviewer seemed to think the game was boring . i 'll guess , instead , that the people he parties with do n't have the attention span for board games . too bad for them . atmosfear - the dvd board game get 's a b+ from me
0	quick shipping on product but the product was not what i was hoping for . the `` snow '' was much grainer than i had expected . i had seen what i thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that `` instant snow '' was very fine and really looked like snow . this product does n't look much like snow and does n't have the same texture
0	this is one of the most beautiful looking barbies we have ever bought . it is also the worst doll to date ! the doll never worked from day one . it 's tail bent up and it made grinding noises and did n't move or swim - just laid there . all the reviews on this site ( which seemed to have disappeared since i notified mga - the toy maker ) were correct - not one buyer had a working doll ! ! ! we bought this for my daughter , niece and friend - and none of the 3 worked . it 's not hard to follow the directions - they are pretty simple - so that is not the problem . also , the hair falls out and is everywhere in the bath water ( pretty gross ) , and the bikini top is near impossible to get back on correctly ! overall , the biggest disappointment in a toy so far
1	my son is 4 1/2 and he loved the set . he and his dad set it up on christmas and enjoyed ringing the bell . i would recommend this for kids any age
1	he 's into firetrucks and mickey mouse so you could n't ask for a better toy . it 's small enough to ride around the house without running into everything , but also durable enough to play outside with . it 's the first thing he goes for in the morning and the last thing he 's playing with at night ( most days )
1	this thing is great . our 4 year old loves it . the working drawbridge , breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great . considering the size and number of pieces , it was remarkably easy to put together . allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly , but the directions are excellent . only complaint is that some of the small pieces that do n't always want to stay together - some of the `` details '' will likely be missing after a few weeks . overall , very happy with it
0	my son received this as a gift when he was 15 months old -- he was already much too tall for the toy ! the box advertizes height adjustment , which simply allows you to lift it up about a half an inch . however , even if he were smaller , the base does not even come close to providing the necessary stability to stand up to even a soft swing ! my son was amused by the lights and sounds for a brief period of time , but quickly lost complete interest in the toy .
1	i bought this for my 5-year old daughter . she really enjoyed using it and actually enjoyed the challenge of having to figure out the answers in the shortest time possible . the different levels of difficulty are useful so she can keep using it over the years
0	i got this as a gift for my 18 month old son . it only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle , very sad . my son got very frustrated and so did i. i would not recommend this product .
1	i first purchased the winnie the pooh soft 'n silly tigger for my son when he was 4 months old . he is now 14 months and loves his tigger . we now have 2 tiggers , one as a back up , and he carries them everywhere he goes . it 's a great toy for young children to sleep with , being soft and cuddly . tigger has been a great comfort for my son and i do n't know what i would have done with out them !
0	i ordered 6 supreme moo mixers . they did arrive before christmas . i received 6 standard moo mixers that should have been priced lower . i notified the company of the error and did n't receive a response . very disappointed . shame on them . i 'm a victum of bait and switch ... .
1	we gave our nine yr. old grandson this train for christmas . he had a such a good time putting it together , then running it on the track . the train absolutely glides on the track , so quietly and smoothly . it is a great product
0	i bought this for my son 's birthday last night since he is interested in music . as i was wrapping it , i noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position . i took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place , wondering how many times i was going to have to do this . i decided to test it once i fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys ( you can even see through them ) . the dollar store has better toys than this . the sound is horrible and uncontrollable . the controls are worthless . i 'm returning it today , and good riddance
0	i think this product needs a lot of hands-on supervision . my son slipped off and knocked the wind out himself twice on the 2nd day of trying this . after a couple of weeks , he finally regained his confidence to try it when a friend was over -- and his 6 y.o . friend slipped and knocked the wind out of herself ( almost had to call the paramedics ) . knowing what i know now ... i would not buy this product for kids under 8 ( follow the age recommendations ! ! ! ! ! ) . i would like to take a pair of wire cutters and cut it down ... .
0	my 6 year old son wanted this so badly from santa . well , he got it and it is sitting in his bedroom and has been there since the 28th of dec. what was a fun attention grabber initially became a boring , furry annoyance rather quickly . it is cute but there are several things that i ( and my son ) found wrong with the product . when he is supposed to be sleeping his eyes do n't close all the way ... kind of creepy especially for something that looks so real ! then his arms that move up and down and are supposed to close in an attempt to give you a hug make a horrible grinding noise ! my son was shocked by the grinding and got upset that his monkey was broken . i explained it away by saying that he probably just needed a backrub . what else are you going to tell a child on christmas morning when his first choice present turns out to be a bummer ? ! cute toy in theory , not so much in person though . i would not recommend this toy
0	it says that it works with vibration , maybe if you are dancing on a trampoline . the kids are not really that impressed
1	we recently played bonkers at our game club . as we read the instructions we were hoping going bonkers would be fun and it was . bonkers is a game based on asking players questions . the questions are not trivia and knowledge-based questions , but instead word-based questions . for instance , a question might ask you to `` come up with words that end in bell '' . during your turn you have 30 seconds to `` go bonkers '' trying to blurt out answers like : barbell ; dumbbell ; doorbell , cowbell etc . your goal would be to find as many answers as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers provided on the game card . for every answer you hit , you win scoring chips . that was just one category of questions called add ons - where you find words that begin or end with a certain word . the other categories are : what the blank - where you find words to complete the blank ; rhyme time - where you find as many rhymes as possible in order to match those provided on the game card ; and letter perfect - where you would find words which begin or end with certain letters . the game play is interesting because there is some strategy thrown in . at the beginning of the round , one player ( the card reader ) peeks at the question and answers on game card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is worth . so , in the example above , the card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips to the answer cowbell , four chips to barbell , three chips to dumbell and two chips to doorbell . this is done by placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer `` a '' ; `` b '' , `` c '' or `` d '' . the object is for the card reader to decide on which answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the hardest answer . this is because if the players do not hit some or any of the answers provided on the game card , the card reader will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the board . however , if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game card , they win the scoring chips for the correct answers provided . i really like the strategy part of the game , it adds a good deal of spice . bonkers provided for an entertaining evening . we will play again !
1	i originally bought this monkey on vacation . i showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it . how could i not buy it for him doing that ? it was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies . i eventually ordered a 2nd one from amazon for my parents house . so now i do n't have to drag it from house to house . as he gets older , he is liking it more and more
1	people say that the iquest stinks because it does n't have all their text books . but i honestly think that even though it may be a little different , there 's no harm in learning new things .
1	my daughter received this toy for her fourth birthday . she plays with it all the time ! ! ! it did n't come with any tapes and honestly she does n't need them ! she spends quite some time speaking into the microphone and using the slide to change the sound of her voice . it is so funny ! we all get a kick out of it . there are several different sounds to choose from . even her two year old twin sisters get into the act . they love it . love this toy . it 's extremely durable . would absolutely recommend this
1	this is a fun toy , just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels . you can ask which one is biggest , what color is this car , ask about the numbers on the cars , etc ... that is why i think it is educational to that respect . my son still has this , and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along
0	this looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself . how they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me . fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it
0	wish i could give this a negative . when i did finally get a sticker out , it would n't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes . ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced
1	my 18-month old has been playing with this for three months now and just loves it . she even knows now which color balls goes in the correct slot . she whacks them all in , puts the balls back , and keeps doing this over and over and over
0	spongebob is making an obscene gesture . personally , i do n't think it is an appropriate toy for children . anyone that thinks spongebob is merely `` pointing '' a finger should n't be so naive as to how toys are marketed and the moral decline of our society ! !
1	we live in alaska and really wanted two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it has been a holiday tradition to play . we found them for purchase on amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to alaska . although we are part of the us and usps ships for a reasonable price , we were n't given that option and paid at least double what it could have been . ups and fedex rip off those of us in alaska while usps treats us just like everybody in the lower-48 . give us a usps option
1	this was the webkinz my daughter wanted , and she 's been very happy with it . there was a delivery problem , but the seller from whom i bought it was a pleasure to deal wit
0	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood , except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard , and i 've thrown most of them out already . it does n't take much to crush them . there are much nicer sets out there , and there are separate pieces sold on ebay , that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better . not worth the money
0	my son received this for christmas 2005 and played with it every day . the conveyor belt is noisy when running and the sponges that whirl around at the end of the car wash were constantly falling off and getting lost . after a month of being played with on a daily basis the conveyor belt stopped working - it still made plenty of noise but did n't move anymore ! when i called mattel they could n't offer me replacement parts as the toy was discontinued in 2001 ! although they gave me a voucher to buy a replacement toy , it was n't for as much as i paid for the toy .
0	i 'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones ! ! ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play . it was n't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort . my son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly . he loved to see the lights and the little puppy `` dance '' when he `` sang '' into the microphone . i continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then i finally put it away . i wish i had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer . my son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the vtech nursery farm which was broken 3 weeks after christmas last year , just before this piano broke . i highly recommend fisher price or leapfrog toys over vtech . we have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 vtech toys we have owned have broken on us . garbage !
0	of all of the expensive gifts i purchased for christmas , this was the one thing my daughter played with consistently . the price is right and now they have free shipping . the one bad thing is that the cards are flimsy and we wore them out !
1	i noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3 & amp ; 1/2 stars and the others all had 5 . i felt a need to speak up . we bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three . we lived in an apartment with a small back patio . it was perfect , not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play . he played for hours ! ! now 5 years later , his little brother loves it and my first son , almost 9 , still plays with the little one in it . it still looks brand new , nestled under the tree in our big back yard . it 's really great just smaller than the others . we have since given this for every two year old birthday present we 've bought ! i highly recommend it
0	save your money ... because if you buy these for your kids you are going to need your money for the hospital ... .they do not work like you think that would..you kid is only bouncing on big rubber bands ... and fall ever time they try to bounce ... very dangerous..they are n't made for anyone..they should be taken off the marke
0	not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies , pretzels , strawberries , etc. , but it does n't even warm up the syrup . so , like someone else said , you may as well fill up a bowl with hershey 's syrup and let the kids dip away . the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did seem to have a really good time playing with this . they thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate
0	they show a pony in the picture . but you wo n't get it , just be careful when you think you will get the dining set and the pony . if you mistakly bought it . just keep it . you will only get partial refund which is half the buying price .
1	we are huge blues clues fans and this is our favorite blue ever ! his is really big and sooooo soft ! this buddy is much more cozy than the smaller beanie baby version . he is a great , cuddly , no frills ( no buttons to push or batteries to replace ) buddy ! my toddler sons love this blue
0	we are very disappointed in this product we purchased last summer . we constantly have many kids and adults of all ages over to our house because of our swimming pool and i do n't think we have found one person who has done more than try it once then walk away . also it is difficult to find the right size to hang it becasue of different sized people using it . not recommended
1	i read some of the reviews posted on this site before i bought this doll , i saw it on ebay but was afaird because of some the comments that was posted about the doll and thought i should buy it directly in case i needed to return it , but i had no problems at all other then the ubc cord the direction said to turn the cord one way when actually it is the other way , other then that i had no problem downloading anything and i ca n't wait to give this to my daughter for easter
0	we bought this for our son for christmas this year based on glowing reviews . what a disappointment ! the `` musical instruments '' are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same , the song the drum plays is tinny , scratchy , and short , and nothing seems very well made . i at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another . on the plus side , it is cute , and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound
0	i bought this as a gift for my nephew . unfortunately it did n't work when it arrived , but fortunately my sister in law was able to take it to a local discovery store and exchange it for one that worked fine
1	when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play . this was how i learned how to play the game . i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above ( 90 's style ) . unfortunately , they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90 's style . if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some . i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me
0	my 5-1/2 year old son received this for christmas . he loves pirates and legos , so it seemed a perfect fit . we were wrong ! the mega bloks are poorly made , and it 's very difficult ( even for an adult ) to get the pieces to stay together . imagine how frustrating this is for a child ... ..we will never purchase mega bloks products again , we 're sticking to the original legos ! nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration ... thanks megabloks
1	i love this doll i only saw her in the store and when i did i fell in love with her i cant wait to get her ! but i do think its a bit pricey but its worth the money
1	it is fun ! and most importantly educational . it has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot . my kids like that part . they are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game , we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges . next year my youngest will want one too , i am sure , as she wants to play theirs , but she is just too little yet , another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then..
0	my son received this as a birthday gift and it broke the 2nd time that he played with it . while i was putting it on him the plastic belt just snapped in half . luckily we had a different belt from another toy that we could use with the gadgets . the previous reviewer was right about the difficulty of taking the gadgets on and off . there 's no way that my 4 year old son could do it without my help . if i had the receipt i would have returned it
0	the pieces were very tiny and the sticker flags kept popping off the plastic . my daughter 's favorite part was the pink and white horse with the carriage , which she promptly took over and put with her dollhouse . after asking santa for a cinderella castle she was a bit disappointed . this playset would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it up and not play with it
1	my 3 year old son plays with them all the time . they are a little challenging and he loves to see the completed puzzle . the box is great and keeps the puzzles separate . each puzzle peice is marked on the back for easy sorting . i am ordering all of the boxed sets asap
1	my daughter had a 12 dancing princess party and she loved the game . it 's a little tricky for her to do the set up , but she enjoys playing it
1	this is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we 've had this dinosaur for quite a while now . usually , we buy our son a toy that he pleads for ( he likes it soooooo much ) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it . this brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love ( 4 2 ) and the included figures are great . this toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price . i highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series . not only does it keep my sons busy ( oh yeah ) but it also helps built their imagination as i hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs . imaginext has even come out with `` new '' dinosaurs in this line which can be found at target or other stores ( i have found that tru has a limited selection ) .
0	in order to answer the questions in this edition of trivial pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of snl . most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family , who have watched snl since it began , and who quote it frequently . i was very disappointed in this game .
1	we were very pleased with the service we received . our purchases were shipped in a timely fashion and came in good condition
1	my 2.5 year old border collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week . since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey , i decided to try this more affordable kid 's tunnel instead . it 's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels , but it has been serving me great for just about a year - there 's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it 's still very usable . my ratings would change a bit for kids though - probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability
1	this is a fun toy for anyone who is a starwars and mr . potato head fan
0	i thought the art had a certain charm , and used strictly as a picture book for children who ca n't yet read , i think it 's quite nice . ( too bad you ca n't make up your own story to go with it . ) the moment the child starts to read , though -- better hide it quick , because ... unfortunately , the book reads like a condensed communist manifesto for kids ( as others have noted ) , or a socialist agenda primer . i do n't know for sure that 's what marcus pfister had as an aim , and i 'm not going to speculate on his politics . he has three kids and may raise them as he likes , and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat . yes , i suppose sharing is nice . certainly sharing one 's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing -- but in america , we get paid for that ( charity is voluntary , not coerced ) . furthermore , stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting ( not necessarily better , just unique and interesting ) , or giving away all your possessions , is a lousy way to make and keep friends , is n't it ? is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy ( a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change , not pandering ) ? is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad ? almost seems like it , at least to me . furthermore , there 's an overtone of `` only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth , '' which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever i 've seen . of course , people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me , but that wo n't make them right . ( the two stars , if you must know , are for the art .
0	the pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove . one picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play
1	the checkbook package was opened . no pieces were missing . but it was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a christmas gift
0	what a disappointment ! the music quality is very poor -- most of the `` intruments '' sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy . the piano is probably the worst ; the animal voices all sound the same . i thought i 'd get better quality at the price , plus , the left speaker does n't work . my kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost $ 12.00 and was the size of an egg-carton , and its sound was vastly superior . i will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this .
0	we received this as a gift and did n't like it at all . my two year old used it for about a day . but it does n't go very far with the remote ( you ca n't just have it move across the floor ) and it 's very noisy ! if it is walked away from you can hear it in the other room still making an annoying noise . i 'd go with something else if you 're looking for a first remote control ca
0	i just recieved a fisher price magazine in the mail and thought this product would be a nice christmas gift . i was thinking that amazon would have a good price , but they are almost double what fisher price is asking . if you go to fisher price 's website this item is only $ 33.00 + $ 7.95 shipping and handling .
0	my daughters are a little young for this toy and are n't that into it yet . it is very cute , with lots of sweet , tiny , realistic pieces , and i can see it having lots of play value and somewhat educational . however , they made it so the arms are jointed in order that she can hold the baby . well , my daughter threw the doll on the floor at the doctor 's office and the bottom half of the arm fell right off . even if it had n't broken , you have to place the arms just right or they look totally strange . this is the least favorite barbie my girls own . if it were n't for the arms , this would be a great toy . oh , and the back of the dresser is open , so you ca n't really store the small pieces in it . not sure why they did n't just close it up to make storage easier .
0	this sudoku yd-638 puzzle is very hard to use . and i think of my self as a computer geek . to make matters worse the instructions are very poor . they may make sense to someone who has used this for years , but not to a new user . save you money to buy a different game .
0	i bought this game for my new family for christmas . this is not at all the game of life that i remember playing for countless hours as a child . first of all , my old game had all of the mountains , houses , and spinner permenantly attached to the game board . with the new version , all of these things have to be attached with each setup , which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board . also , the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot . the cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car . finally , the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial . i think i will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future
0	my 2 year old son loves to `` cook '' and to serve mommy and daddy meals from his kitchen . my only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor . it is n't very sturdy , but i 'm not unhappy with this purchase
0	this toy is great fun but it is n't very durable . ours broke after about an hour . there was a loud pop and then it stopped erupting . i guess the plastic bladder must have given out . the kids were terribly disappointed
1	i 've enjoyed playing this game with people from around the world- it seems to work best with a group of people who have n't been hanging out together since childhood . it gets people talking and makes for an evening of all sorts of interesting stories- and you get to find out what interesting people your friends are
1	my son turned 4 on tuesday and i had bought this and was saving it as a birthday gift ! he absolutely loves it ! he has spent hours and hours of time already sitting and playing with this playset and his turtles . even my husband thinks it 's cool ! it was n't too difficult to put together and it stays together quite nicely ! great toy for a 4 year old that loves tnmt
1	i recently bought these 4 little dora dolls for my 4 yr old 's birthday . she really loves them . she plays with them all the time . it is a nice collection to her dora stash !
0	i ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons . they were unable to inflate either soccer ball on christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked . if there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit , i would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready . i had to go out and buy new needles the day after christmas . we 'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump
1	my 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last christmas , and for the first couple of months was used practically every day . ( and yes , i agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them , and prepare to be disappointed since it can not pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck . ) i will tell you that i can not believe my son has not touched this engine since . his complaint is that all it does is go around and around . instead , he enjoys playing out stories from thomas , or making up his own train sagas . my husband likes to watch the engine more than my son . i do n't know how other children play with their trains , but the battery operated engines just can not hold his attention for very long . nevertheless , for the first few months , watching it is really mesmerizing , i could watch it for hours . perhaps instead of buying this one engine , purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money . it will probably get more use in the end
0	i did not buy this from amazon but sought it out here so i could vent about this outrageous product ( that 's 'outrageous ' in its traditional meaning , that it outrages me ) . this is two packets of colored dust , approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster . empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere , mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart . my wife and i repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not . the claim on the package is that it `` molds like dough , '' obviously intended to remind us of play-doh , but play-doh is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can , in fact , be molded . this material -- again attempting to compare itself to play-doh -- states that it wo n't dry out . of course not ! it 's dust ! it ca n't dry out , there 's nothing drier than dust . in case you 're wondering i have no connection to play-doh or its makers ( i do n't even know who does make it ) , i 'm simply the father of a 3-year old who uses play-doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime . wrong
1	well the space is limated but i learned how to deal with it . the set comes with four parts rainforestchamber , bug chamber , aquarium , and ant colony . the aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in . then we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big . finally we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the four . the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but since i bought this during winter i will have to wait till spring to catch a lizard . and we all know what you put in a bug chamber . over all i rate this four stars due to small space . p.s there a bug catcher in it as well
1	everything was great ! great bed , easy to assemble , my son loves it . though he still wants to sleep in my bed , but he does play in it , that 's a good sign , huh
0	my two year old absolutely would not leave the store without this and she still plays with it a year later . however , there are two problems . one , it immediately needed repair to the basic connections and , two , it has a pinching hazard between the basket and the frame . but of course , my daughter never noticed either of those . she simply loves to play with it , constantly , and has to take it on walks around the block
1	the x-23 figure availible on amazon.com is dressed in purple but there also is a black one - a variant that is alot harder to find [ i resorted to ebay for mine ] . the build of the figure is great - there 's so much articulation , it 's insane ; and her feet claws actually tuck under her shoes so they can be concealed which is beyond cool . the articulation , for the most part , is great . my only qualm with it is it makes her arms look funny but i can deal with that . she 's barely 6 inches tall , i do n't expect her to be perfect . however , the reason i 'm giving her three stars is because i feel the purple outfitted one is far inferior to the black outfitted x. i recieved my black clad x-23 first and expected the same figure but in a purple for my other one but i was wrong . the black x-23 has very dark brown hair that lays straight and lank while the purple x-23 's hair is jet black and windblown which makes her head almost impossible to move around . also , the thing that bothers me the most is that x 's eyes are green on the black suited version but on the purple suited version , they 're orange . i am a big x-23 fan and i understand that when she 's `` triggered '' , her eyes go crazy reddish orange , but that 's not something i really want to see sitting on top of my computer monitor . it 's kind of creepy ! and on a sidenote , when did x-23 wear purple ? in her comics she was either in black , dressed as a civilain or in the old wolverine costume [ which you can see in the comic that comes with x-23 ] . i would 've prefered a variant wearing the wolverine costume while the black x-23 was mass produced . so , personally , i would recommend hunting down the variant of x-23 for your collection . she looks nicer and , i think , is more true to the character
0	it wroke 2 minutes later after openning , my husbund try to fixed but surprice all the inside partes are `` plastic '' you can`t fixed . do not waist your money
0	it did n't even last 24 hours before it split at the seams in several different spots . do n't waste your money
1	these dominos are great for the hello kitty lover . my six year old loves them . do n't be fooled by the picture though , the tin is not full . if you ask me , there are not enough of them in there . the tin is filled about three quarters with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it look full . i would have rated it five stars if it had been full
1	very complete with a lot of things to play for hours . my daughter still plays with it , and she is now four years old . definitely it was worth it . highly recommended
0	i purchased this item for my son 's birthday . not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it . also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly . after a couple of days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min . successful flight . on the second day , after 15 mins of recharging the battery , the battery case and wires melted . have contacted company for a refund .
1	another nice product from playdough . worth the ten bucks or so.. we just bought this from amazon . this would make a cute birthday present for a young child , say 2 to 8 ? hard to give an age as i myself like to sit with my son and play ! enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage . i would buy this again as a gift
1	my daughter got this for her 6th birthday . she absolutely loves it , as does her 3 year old sister . one of them is using it all the time . the 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old , as she ca n't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her . my 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the dvd . my 3 year old ca n't do them all , but she has a great time just doing what she can . both of my girls love cinderella , so they put on their dress up cinderella dresses whenever they do the dvd . i wish there was a way to order just an extra mat , though , so they could do the dvd together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat
0	purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers . wanting to check out what i purchased , i opened one of the five . the geodes are tiny ( not as pictured ) . it was like breaking open dirt-clods ... that have a small empty space inside ... but not crystals . maybe it was a `` dud '' box , but will probably be returning the other four .
0	i recently purchased this item for my daughter who has been wanting to paint . i thought this would be great because the paint is in the brush and it wo n't be messy . although all this is true , both of us found it very frustrating that it was difficult to get out of the tube . if this is made for children , should n't it be easier to use and should an adult really have trouble with it
1	it was the most popular gift on his first birthday . he loved pushing it , sitting on it and moving the small animal figures . lots of different kinds of fun for him
0	most of the other reviews for this toy are correct . when it works my kids love it . and it is pretty cool when it works . but it does n't work very well very often . you need to find just the right car and everything needs to line up exactly . and even then the car crashes a lot . we have found one car ( out of about 200 ) that works somewhat well . but even with this car the success rate is about 1 in 15. so , read the reviews and make your own judgements . personally , i 'm glad this was a gift and i did not spend any money on it . my kids will still play with and enjoy it , but not as much as they would if it worked better
1	this is the first rc ( radio control ) aircraft i have ever flown , although i have raced rc cars for quite awhile . it comes fully assembled with a nice manual and even a quick intro dvd to get you in the air quickly . i started out in my living room and it has worked just great . with just a little trimming out the heli is very stable and easy for which to get a feel . i 've run it for a few hours now with no incidents and i 'm getting pretty good at hovering although i still have a tough time with head-in flight ( controls thus reversed ) . the blade cx rtf makes a great first heli or just a great indoor heli . probably fine for anyone over 10 years old . i am getting 10-15 minutes of flight time on a battery charge . the only disappointment is that charging a battery takes 60-90 minutes ( typical with all lipo batteries ) . i 'd recommend getting an extra battery or two and maybe even an extra powersupply and charger . also i have tried the training gear add-on for the blade cp/cp pro -- it fits the cx just fine and allows you to use it later if you move on -- and it helps with damage but makes the blade cx slightly less stable in hover in my opinion but not terribly so . they 're probably worth the trade off at first . in a few more hours i think i 'll be ready to move up to the blade cp pro . highly recommended for anyone interested in entering rc helicopters or who just wants a heli to fly around the house . two good sites for further info are [ ... ]
0	unless you are prepared to be constantly putting the ropes and the masts back on the ship , this toy is a complete waste of money . my son had been wanting the black pearl for quite some time and this was a huge disappointment to him . buyer beware
1	love this new edition to yatzee . it is so handy to have the tray so your dice do n't go flying everywhere . this game is really a good game for the whole family
1	my grandson has truly enjoyed the easyscore basketball set from the first day he tried it . wonderful to have the adjustment for heightening as he grows .
0	my husband and i just bought the family feud 2nd edition dvd tv games . i have to say we both loved this game when it was first on ( and on gsn as repeats ) and i like the computer version . we played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring as someone said they ca n't believe they put this out . if you are going to get this game then buy the computer version . you have 5 rounds round # 1 round # 2 double money round triple money round fast money round you have team a and team b . if you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal . however , you only get one x . per guide ... if an answer is revealed that team a did not have written down , they press wrong answer button and pass the remote to team b . team b now has the opportunity to steal the round . so most of the game was passing the remote back and forth . if the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round ( even if you-team a had that written down ) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly ( even if they got 4 out of 5 and both teams say have the same answer ) the game itself was simple and basic . there was no real fun to it . we tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun . one person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on tv over playing this version of the game . you get two markers ( red and blue ) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards . the negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to . another thing is that the same game will come up more than once . we had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice . this is the 3rd or 4th dvd game we have been given or bought . this is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again
1	my son loves the imaginext dino collection . he has almost all of them . they 're durable , fun and educational
0	a one star rating for this toy is way to charitable . the car does nothing but jerk , and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button . disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy ! surely they had to have an idea about their product 's poor performance . my advice is everyone should print off the reviews from amazon and all like it . with this in hand , march into disney stores and demand ( 1 ) their money back ( 2 ) an apology . the only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 gmc jimmy
0	i bought this for my son 's first birthday . he loved it ! but , after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it . he still plays with it a little bit , but not like when it made noise . i would n't have wasted my money if i had known the batteries would only last a month
0	the canopy bar broke only two days after christmas . now i have a sharp end on the bed frame . not good for little fingers . for the price , i thought it would have been a lot more sturdy
0	my 7 year old saw the ads for digidraw and drove me absolutely crazy until christmas rolled around last year . the look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived . it was nearly impossible to assemble . the time and patience it required to 'trace ' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old . the only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils
1	i purchased this for my daughter a bit before christmas and she loves it . it is a great item for the price and does what the bigger brand names does . thank you
0	what a co-incidence , my first 3d puzzle too . average difficulty for the average user . would not recommend it for the beginner . the panels are not hard to put together , but it is fiddly putting all the panels together . once done , the model is quite magnifique . and got me started on 3d puzzles . hasbro/wrebbit should give everyone 1 free 3d puzzle , then everyone would get hooked on it . none of the 3d puzzles can stand a lot of handling , however this eiffel tower actually survived a show and tell . sadly it now rests in 3 pieces and i 'm too lazy to put it back together again . highly recommended
1	this shopping cart is the perfect height for my daughter . my two boys even love to use it to cart around their cars and blocks ! highly recommended
1	breyer makes such authentic lifelike replicas of the worlds most beautiful horses . my daughter is in horse heaven . the detail is so accurate that my daughter noticed even the footpad of the horses were unique to each one
1	i got this for my 5 year old , who started kindergarten this fall , and she is in love with the whole school concept . she loves to pretend to be the teacher with this playset . her friend came over one day and played with it , too , and they took turns being the student and teacher . i ended up buying another set for her friend 's birthday .
1	i do n't agree with the other review this doll is great to play with . she has such a pretty dress and vail . her hair is very long and it get tangled pretty easy but if your good with barbie hair its not a problem . i would suggest that you buy the groom at the same time take it from me i still really want him . the barbie with blond hair is also very pretty
1	ms. pac man was always my game back in the day . she just seemed less clunky than her male predecessor . i just received this game in the mail today and after a mad scramble for eight ( count 'em eight ) aa batteries i got down to business . i admit that i bought this game for ms. pac man , exclusively . here 's what i found , in a nutshell : pros : 1 ) graphics sound are faithful to the old arcade game with the minor exception of the placement of the score , lives and fruit . no problem . 2 ) old skool joystick . nice touch . 3 ) plug 'n play set-up . no brainer . cons : 1 ) i honestly do n't mind cords one bit . the eight batteries can be a bit of a logistical problem as i do n't usually have a dozen-or-so batteries lying around at any given time . 2 ) my main gripe is that the joystick is frustratingly unresponsive and has the habit of moving ms. pac in directions i do n't want her to go . i understand , however , that the previous version of this game was worse in this regard and has been slightly improved in this version . fair 'nuff . all-in-all a neat little contraption that is every bit as addictive as it was in my youth .
1	my son loves this game . when moving around the tracks , in the one game it can be difficult , the key is if you moving up or down , depending on which direction you need to go , push the joystick the direction once and let go , after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go . i hope this helps . my son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks . mom , dad and sis had to play before that . the other games are a little easier , but i found the games educational and my son loves it
0	my 11 yr old thought this was amazing but the maneuver wheels on the bottom will only run over hard surfaces and not carpet which was ok with us . he did , however , run it over carpet and the traction wheel rubber pully snapped . the legs are also quite fragile and after only 2 days of play , one of the legs broke . because of that , the spider can not `` walk '' now ! too bad because its looks great . we are going to send it back .
0	anxiously awaited this very expensive box of cards mostly for the special insert cards but there was only the autograph card and no memorabilia card . you can not realize the disappointment one feels when this happens . you look and look , searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow , but no . no memorabilia card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles . of course , the topps company does n't have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby ! thanks .
0	we used the machine once , and were disappointed by the performance . the second time that we attempted to use it , it would n't heat . after contacting roseart , i was told that i could ship it to them at my expense for a replacement . i will probably not bother , as it was a lousy product to begin with .
1	i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey . there are no other ones like it . they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever ! there are n't any other plastic nativity sets out there . get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable . it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year . i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth . they love it
0	when we bought this , i liked the versatility it offered . i quickly noticed , however , that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere . there are actually too many pieces to keep up with , and frankly i 'm getting sick of stepping on the cow . my 6 mos old likes it for a couple minutes , until he 's rolled away from it . my 3 year old thinks it 's interesting , but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place . after a couple days of playing with it i usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys . the water play mat lasted until my 3 year old stepped on it once or twice . then that was gone
1	my nephew loves this gift . in fact , he would n't allow his sister to play with it , so now she also has one
1	my toddler and all of her friends love this play house . it is great , no assembly required
1	i purchased the parents magazine version first and my one year old son did n't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this hasbro toy i purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since . the buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time . he also enjoys teething on the keys . i highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys
1	my kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with renaissance paintings . they 've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them . i realize this is not the typical situation . i was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck . it is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid 's knowledge . i had hoped for a game like `` famous authors '' which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players . nonetheless , the game is well presented . it 's on the expensive side , but the book alone is worth half the price . looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones ? i recommend this
0	i have a big dora fan in my house this was one of her first dora dolls ( last year ) . she played with it for the first day or two ... its loud , very mechanical , not very appealing . the toy saw a rebirth in use when it was discovered that it she could make dora dance terrorize the puppy . the doll only does one dance , regardless of what skirt she has on now . from reading other reviews , if i pushed held it while she was wearing it she might ballet , but not worth the hassle ! since then , my dora lover has received various other dora dolls , so we have a collection that sings , dances , speaks various languages , and the only one she plays with regularly is the dress up adventure dora - she 's more posable , does something other than sing , and you can change her outfits . perfect for my almost 5 year old
0	i bought this identical bed at toys r us for $ 175.00 . this person is ripping people off , do your shopping before paying their mark up and shipping costs
0	i was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side-boards which is very dangerous for kids . i was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson 's wagon which i purchased for his 2nd birthday . he is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off
1	my son got these blocks when he was 2 for christmas . he is now 4 and 1/2 and still playing with them . it seems no matter what new toy he has gotten , every morning i hear him carrying out his bucket of these megabloks . i only wish they came is a larger quantity .
1	love it ! the questions are great ... the `` party mode '' is great entertainment
1	two grandsons ( 4 years and 6 years ) have truly enjoyed this cartridge . recommend it highly !
1	i bought this set for my three children 5,4,2 last christmas at a fancy toy store . this product is top of the line and my kids can not get enough of this . the marble runs are easy to build , sturdy and so much for them to play with . there are a variety to build with the more advanced sets also we bought a few more `` fun '' and cool looking marbles as they raced them down . the kids can change out the different blocks to make the marbles react in different ways- which is a creative aspect . i love this toy ! ! ! ! my kids beg me to make them a new marble run all the time . you do need a hard surface to build on , since we did n't have a `` train table '' we put it on a hard piece of cardboard so it laid flat on the carpet , that way you do n't have to hear the clink-clink of the marbles as they hit the bottom..
1	fisher-price is bringing back old time well-made toy construction with their peek a blocks ! i have 4 kids who are 5 and under , and i have to say that they all get use out of these blocks ! if you love peek a blocks , please feel free to join my peek a blocks group at yahoo groups : http : //groups.yahoo.com/group/fisherpricepeekablocks/ it is completely free and we have been having some interesting discussions on there about unknown secrets of peek a blocks !
0	i recieved this itema s a gift . i thought it would be great i was wrong ! the designs it gives you are really cool but the ploish that comes with this is awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	her favorite toy ... she loves the microphone ... keys light up to prompt her to press the keys and play a song ... . this thing is great
1	i purchased this for my son @ babies r us only because i had a gift card ... but i dont regret it at all ... this is one of kristobals ' favorite toys from the peek a block collection ! my oldest son enjoys it also ! not bad for 20bu
0	i bought this as a christmas present for my 4-year-old daughter . she is a huge my little pony fan . ponyville lives in our house in fact . we got it out and played with it for a couple hours . we did n't have the problems described with the hand crank . that seems to be very durable . the problem is with the flower that zippee goes in . a pony steps on the flower to open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to close it . after a couple hours , the flower petals are now broken and ca n't be repaired . toys certainly do n't have the quality in them that they used to . hasbro 's quality in general has declined . this was demonstrated in the newest my little pony castle as well . this toy has some neat features . the crank works well and the braiding mechanism is useful . the breezie that lives in the flower goes along with the story in the my little pony video series . the colors are vivid and bright . i would have liked to suggest that the pink stage that the daffidazey stands on should have had built-in storage to hold the hair accessories . some additional clips would also have been a nice addition to this set . 4 clips for a set that is designed to do all your ponies ' hair is a bit skimpy . the braids are nice and tight and even a young child can operate this toy ... .with a bit of assistance . ( hint : putting suction cups or velcro hook and loop on the bottom makes it even easier for little ones to play with minimal adult assistance )
0	my 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank . two goldfish , two flushes . if i take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around , but they wo n't last 24 hours in this tank . i 've followed the directions to a t , adjusted the ph , tried lights on lights off , pump on pump off , even used bottled water , but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank
0	this toy was a huge disappointment for me . my boys took one look at it and threw it . i thought it was much bigger than what it is . i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it was n't even a decent size . my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just was n't what i envisioned . it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children
0	my 3 year old has 8 vsmile games and this is his least favorite . his top 2 favorite is toy story and winnie the pooh
0	i was very disappointed with the quality of this product . i had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit . the second kit also had the same problem . both kits had to be returned . it is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is missing items within the kit
1	ok so my son got it for christmas and here it is june and i just hooked it up . it took me all of 5 mintutes not even that to program it . the first try # 4 wouldnt take so what i did is i put the toy remote on one thigh and the remote on the other so that there were almost touching and so that the `` eyes '' were right on top of each other . and it took straight away . its really fun for my 4 year old my 10 year old got bored . my only suggestion is that there needs to be a bigger choice of games . they are so similar that my 4 year old changes games quite a bit . i am actually having trouble finding games for it now . its great and if they are going to be in front of the tv might as well be learning . he also hase vsmile which is a little bit better if you can afford the 60 $ for the game unit and 20 $ for the games . ( grandma and grandpa got ours for us with games ) so it wasnt bad for us . read with me dvd is good though , i really enjoy playing it and listening to the stories
1	our family played this game a lot during the 60 's . we had a blast with it . i did n't think much about it until this year when my son turned 6 . it 's a blast for family fun
1	there are always problems with an any type of bed , even an inflatable one . i am actually 21 , but i do n't have a credit card so i had to use the kid review instead . this bed is great . of course there are problems , but they do n't outweigh the good that the bed has . it is great to sleep on , you can carry it on trips , you can have it on another bed that is in one place , or on the floor . i do admit , it is somewhat hard to set up , but it is worth the effort , for the sleep is unparralleled . i sleep on it every night and i have had no problems with it at all . i recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to adult because of the gap it has between the side and the mattress . what is the most important thing of all is this : is the person you bought it for happy with it
0	there is no magic in this wand . what appeared to be a thin wooden malfoy 's wand , turned out to be a poor replica made of plastic . my son was very disappointed . he used his own hard earned money to purchase this item
0	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew . the versitility of this one looks great . well , i liked it more than either one of my children did , as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that , it just got taken apart and lost its interest , no matter which way i arranged the peices . infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads
1	my son received these when he was 7 months old and we are loving them ! they 're adorable and chunky and work great on carpets or hard floors . they 're easy for little hands to hold on to and a couple of them rattle . when my nephews come over they always find these -- and they 're 5 and 7
1	i got this for my 2 year old for christmas . it was a nice present , he enjoys it . 2 things though , it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is . it could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max , and that is two 2-3 year olds . it is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in big bird 's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money , especially since i did n't pay for shipping
0	i bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons . within the first 10 minutes of use , they both tipped over numerous times . they tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor . definitely not a sturdy trike . my husband and i were very disappointed and returned them immediately . in reading other reviews , i see that our experience with these trikes is not unique
0	i bought this for my 6 year old after christmas as her cousin received one and loved it . i ran all over town trying to find the pvd 's ( which are hard to find a good selection of ) . i ended up purchasing some online . by the time the pvd 's arrived , the player was no longer working . we have replaced the batteries several times . on a rare occasion , it will turn on , but that is very rare . we are very disappointed with this unit . i should have listened to my husband and bought the dvd player !
0	this suduko handheld game was not user friendly . i returned it for a full refund
1	my 28 month old son got this puzzle for christmas and loves it . he put it together the first time out of the box himself . it is the first thing he does every morning and then several times a day . my almost 5 year old likes it too . it is not as sturdy as the melissa doug floor puzzles , but it still really sturdy .
0	my daughter wanted this for christmas more than anything . but the doll is very difficult to use . suzie has these sudden shutdowns where she turns off for no apparent reason . then suddenly she 'll come back to life later . she `` grows '' almost instantly . despite my best efforts to try and protect the grow button . i reset her constantly . getting her to do all of the fun `` big girl '' things she is suppossed to do is frustrating for my five year old . essentially , i have spent more time fiddling with suzie than my daughter has spent playing with her . and the face paint came off almost immediately . even with the small amount of time that she has been working . perhaps when my daugter is a little older , she can spend time fiddling with her . she does play with her as just a `` baby doll '' so it has n't been a total waste . but i certainly did n't need to spend the extra money for all of the electronics that do n't work . oh , and sometimes i 'll walk into my daughters room and she 'll suddenly `` wake up '' and start saying mama . very horror movieish .
1	i loved this trike ! it was given to my son for his first birthday and he loved it . daycare was in walking distance ( i lived in the city ) and i used the trike to take him . my son loved to hold onto the handle bars , it gave him a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated . my son is now three years old and i am buying a new one for my one year old . i understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is a 1-800 number that goes with the toy . the brand radio flyer is well known and the customer service line is very helpful and willing to replace parts or defects . this is the only gift that was given to my son that i can say `` i love '' and have had for more than just one year ! enjoy
1	my son is a very active 2 yr old and very hard on toys , and these are great . thick plastic construction . easy enough for him to hook them up himself . we have 2 different kinds and they are both super
1	if your child likes the wiggles like my 2 year-old does , then she 'll love this keyboard . except that there is no volume button , which i consider rude to the parents . :
0	my 3 yr old son received this toy last year for christmas and was so excited . in less than a week , one of the rear wheels cracked in half , rendering it a non-returnable piece of junk
1	i bought her and veronica too ! i love to them ! ! i play archie and date them..they are my fun girls ! ! my wife likes them too
0	we got this set for my 4 year old son for christmas . his eyes lit up when he saw it . he dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away ... .we did n't , of course ... we waited a whole day ... thank goodness ... it literally took an hour to put together . there are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different . it was very frustrating ... then it would n't stay together once it was finished . it has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since . he gets so upset when he tries to play with it . we saved the box . it 's going back , if they will take it ...
0	big disappointment . cheaply made . t-rex model does not snap together , can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded . microscope less functional than a magnifying lens . volcano is ok , the plaster does work , but you must provide ingredients for the eruption . weather center very very flimsy and breaks . i was quite surprised a name like smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product . supplies for crystals subpar for what is required . was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons .
0	it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off . parents this machine dose n't work only made with suger thats all it is and also it takes forever ? think before you buy your children will get cavities you will also spend your money on this instead of food or other need
1	i 've been wanting this forever and when i got it , it was totally awsome ! ! first it comes with a really , really cool chair ( that you are going to love ! ) , it also comes with a sweet guitar with amp ( fyi . the amp has some really cool stickers on it ) and it also includes two ( 2 ) guitar magazines . i truly love this piece mainly because i 've always wanted an amp for my guitars . oh , i highly , highly recommend this you 'll love it ! well hope this helps . : )
0	good luck getting this bed ! i ordered it 5 months ago ( with availability being 2-4 weeks . each month i was told it will available `` next month . '' i finally cancelled my order and purchased the little tykes one before my frustrated 3 yr. old outgrows a toddler bed . kidkraft needs to focus more on actually manufacturing their products and less on marketing for orders they are unable to fulfill
0	we were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday . after opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied . however the screen is very disappointing . i ca n't even rate the games because overall i simply just ca n't see what is on it . the product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing . i should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products . i would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it
1	my family loves this game because there are several different games you can play with it and it goes along with the book , so the kids like to compare it.this product is very durable and will last
1	this toy is a wonderful first toy . it captures their attention and has all kinds of handles for them to grab when they 're ready ! i absolutely love it , and so does my son
1	someone gave these to us when my son was 9 months old . he loved holding them and it has been fun watching him learn to `` color '' and develop his hand-eye coordination . he is now 22 months old and we 've just used them up and i had to buy the crayola tub crayons because i could n't find these at toys r us . the crayola crayons are thinner ( which does n't hold up as well to toddler abuse ) and have more colors , but i like these better because they come with the ducky sponge to wash the crayon off the walls ( my son loves that part , too ) . these crayons are a surefire way to get my son into the bathtub
0	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood , except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard , and i 've thrown most of them out already . it does n't take much to crush them . there are much nicer sets out there , and there are separate pieces sold on ebay , that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better . not worth the money
1	very interesting spoof of the original game . i found the first one boring after a few plays , but this one still interests my kids and i after 10+ plays . it 's a bit convoluted to put it together initially , but well worth it
0	this is a great starter deck for any duelist . with just a few booster packs this deck will become unstopable ! after only a few days of practice with this deck i had beaten all of my friends who had been dueling for months .
0	i would n't even give this toy one star if i was n't forced to . mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980 's graphics and even worse sound . it sounds like my husband 's 1985 casio watch . the only thing they did well with this product is market it . i gave this to my daughter from santa and i am still going to return it .
1	even though i 'm convinced that all monitors work differently in different locations , this model has treated us well . we got this monitor ( with dual receivers ) for my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago and it was always clear crisp . reception was perfect in the basement , in the frontyard , in the backyard ... even at the neighbor 's house . one of the receivers konked out after about 2 years but we survived with only one . the second receiver finally stopped working last week after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research , i decided to go with the same , trusty , inexpensive monitor and it works great ! i 've never slept with a monitor in our room ( because our babies stay with us for a long time ) so i do n't know about nighttime quirks . i keep the monitor in our kitchen area to listen for the little one waking up from naps ... .and to spy on the girls when they play upstairs without me . : ) baby # 3 is on the way i 'm sure this monitor will last another 3 years until we do n't need it anymore . so , $ 40 over the course of 3 children is n't bad !
1	we received boggle jr as a gift at christmas . my daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this game . she is learning her words and is learning to spell . this is a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter words . i told my sister and she requested it for her son . he 's a happy camper with the game , too
0	my son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift . however one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that . it is poor quality and construction . do n't use it unless your kids are the gentle kind . most kids would break this the first time .

0	this item came in the mail and my 4 year old son and i were very excited . i guess we should have read the description more carefully because i was n't expecting so many tiny little pieces . we used ticky tack and began the tedious process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over his room . we waited that night to see the glowing celestial extravaganza . we kept the light on for some time to 'charge ' the glow in the dark element then turned off the light . what we found was nothing close to amazing . the glow was fairly dim and only lasted for a very short period of time . we even turned a blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little brighter but , again , the glow only lasted about 10 -15 minutes . i ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and a star shaped sponge . we dabbed stars all over his ceiling . these glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family think his room is really cool
1	okay , we all know about the disney cars craze and trying to hunt down all the new die-cast characters mattel puts out . these 1:24 scale models are very , very nice and the size is perfect for young boys , girls or collectors . the only downside is that they only made mater and mcqueen . who would n't love to see chick hicks or the king in 1:24 scale ? ! come on mattel ! get with it ! ! ;
0	this thing is a waste of time effort and money . it falls apart the minute the child tries to swing the baby , not to mention it is too small for a two tear old to play with
1	we learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school . i was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood , so totally enraptured these little kids ! kapla , are 'blocks ' that are all exactly the same size . at first glance , they seem boring . but once you start playing with them , they are so much more . they can be made into all kinds of structures , and can even be raised higher than one can reach , without falling ! ! when our 'surprise blessing ' turned 2 , i pulled them out for him . he enjoyed them ( though at 3 he likes them much more ) , but what surprised me is that my older two ( 15 and 13 ) love playing with them as well ! ! in fact , we all do ! ! i know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these , but they are more than worth it !
0	my daughter got this for christmas this year and almost immediately pulled off the top half of the greg character on the keyboard . in their defense , none of the other characters have come off so we will try to return this in case it was an isolated incident . other than that , she seems to like it . she also received the accordian and loves it so i would recommend that over the keyboard
1	the wagon is great , as expected . 5 stars for the wagon , no stars for delivery . it arrived with a dent , though , and when we called they told us a replacement would n't be available until mid-february , plus we 'd have to figure out how to re-pack the thing , which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and spray-painted the spot , and the recipients probably wo n't care , but it was a pain-in-the-butt , and there did n't seem any way to deal with it that would n't have been too much trouble .
0	just received one for my son 's birthday . he loves it as he has a laptop like daddy . the quality is terrible , like another user 's experience the right side of the device does n't work properly and this is brand new . apparently the sensors on the device do n't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side . i ca n't exchange it as i am not in the us so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are . this of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff . also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old . ps the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer
1	i like the language tutor and the music stuff ! i also like the screen savers ! it 's given me great ideas ! i play with it in a different way than you are supposed to . like if i need a story starter i go to the `` magic act '' and read the sentences for an idea
1	we bought this toy for our 1 year old son . it is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great . i agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well . my biggest compaint , however , is that when both lids are closed , the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder . our son constantly tries to climb it , like stairs . the other day , he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle . my son fell over with it and crashed on his face . there are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon , but they do not prevent it from falling over . my son is fine , but this toy is very dangerous and i do not recommend it !
1	i am confused by the poor reviews of this product . my daughter received this toy from the easter bunny this year and the whole family plus grandparents/aunts/uncles etc . have had a ball with it . it creates huge bubbles round or long , that float in the air for quite a bit of time . i do agree that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a three year old to work ... but for the price i have to say this toy is well worth it ! we also made our own solution ( granny 's recipe ) and it worked ... very messy and sudsy though . i would recommend this product to anyone who loves bubbles
0	the stars may be really nice , but the package i received looked already open . the 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars .
0	swing comes out of base every time you try to put the baby doll in it and i bought the exact baby for it . the educational value of 3 stars is for me , you get what you pay for most of the time
0	this is a piece of garbage . the balls deflate after a couple hours . the rim is so frail it wo n't hold up to much . my friend came over and yelled slam dunk threateningly at my hoop at which point i got in between them and the hoop and said this hoop was not for slam dunking . they correctly pointed out that it says `` slam dunk challenge '' right on the back board . do n't do it - it will break . when i turned it on it kept score wrong and gave points for misses . so that function is worthless . the only reason i gave it two stars is that it looks kind of cool but will have to find a nerf ball .
0	this jack in the box is pretty flimsy . not worth the price . would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense .
1	my three children are huge fans of melissa and doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly . being an organization freak myself , i was in search of the perfect storage case . not only did it need to hold many puzzles , but it needed to be made well and look nice too . melissa and doug to the rescue - once again ! we purchased the same storage case in natural and it 's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore . you might find it hard to spend $ 30 on an empty storage case so i suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $ 60 instead . more for your money ! in our case , we own so many puzzles that we did n't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have
1	we bought this pool toy for our daughter , and she was thrilled ! ! ! but after being on this toy one time we now call him the bucking bull . good luck staying on the silly thing . now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we pull her around the pool on it . my husband and i can not stay on this thing either . every now and then we bail on with sheer determination , only to be off in a matter of seconds
0	i bought this toy along with mr . incredible for my son 's birthday . he loves the movie and was very excited to get these toys . unfortanitly , they lasted all of five minutes before syndromes head fell off , and mr. incredibles hand broke off . after that i had to deal with a crying kid . if you want the toy just to look at , then it is good , but if you buy it for your child , do n't expect it to last long
0	whatver your favorite fruit may be , this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games . it is basically boring , and ill-conceived . i have played it a few times with my kids , and found it to be of no particular interest on any level-it is neither fun , exciting or challenging , for them or me . i strongly recommend you try a cranium game , or how about chess ? ? ? the only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game , is that it 's better than tv , which is n't saying much
0	i purchased this for my 8 year old for christmas and thought i would be able to store more than just a few songs , but the memory capacity is actually only 109m and will actually only hold about 8-10 songs , no where near the 2 hours promised . i would not recommend this purhcase to any child
1	just wanted to let others know this info that i found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at costco ... i called costco and they carried the kidkraft art table with two stools back in january of 2006 , and will no longer be carrying it . you can find it at walmart for $ 66 plus shipping , just check the website . the table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different , the sides of the tables is slightly different ( on one side of the kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups , and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto ) . the stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table . overall it looks a little less substantial , but since i have n't seen it in person , i really ca n't give my opinion . hope that helps someone
0	i bought this for my 2 yr old daughter . i was so surprised at the quality for little tykes . it has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed . i think it should cost half of what it does . i purchased the step two kitchen when my daughter was three , and it is way better by far
1	i am the star wars fanatic i really like this toy ! it has firing misiles and stickers to put on the vehicle . and , you can open the wings ! this is a great toy !
1	this is the best game for the beach and the car . the little letters clip right into the board . it has a zipper case also . it 's great and we enjoy it very much
0	this was purchased for my 2 yr old son who loved to draw and scribble . he was so excited to see thomas riding the track - well it worked the day we opened it and never again ! i would recommend not spending the money on this one and get the regular aquadoodle for 1/2 the price ! you are not able to wash the mat so if you get anything on it ( eg . crayon or dirt ) you ca n't get it out .
0	i was so excited when i ordered my star wars holographic emperor figure . i 'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks ! ! when i got home today , the box with the amazon logo was on my doorstep . upon opening the box , i was completely disappointed to find that the emperor figure i 'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed . the people packing this stuff are half-wits ! ! anybody with a brain would know better than to cram something into a box like that ! ! they should be ashamed of their service to all you collectors out there ... .beware ! !
0	my son kept seeing the commercials for this doll and he wanted it so badly . talked about it for a month so we got it for him . he was super excited when he got and and the thing did n't work . it just randomly gives clues that confused my son the point of tears . he was so confused it would tell him that he was close to it , then say he was no where near it . then when he was standing next to it , it said he was no where near it . he was so disappointed . he thought the toy would be able to play hide n seek with him . we followed the directs and helped him play with it . he 's 4 . ( he was n't running around like crazy like another person mentioned was why it does n't work for some kids . ) i think this is a terrible toy and hayley 's now in the trash . she 's too cheap and junky looking to even save for my daughter as a regular doll to play with
1	my son received this as a christmas gift , and thoroughly enjoys it . this is not a regular dvd . it is designed to go with the `` read with me dvd '' system ( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv ) . a previous reviewer was not aware of this , so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error
1	i enjoy seeing my twin four year old son 's play with the read with me dvd program and cd 's . the children are learning as they play . i see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story . this educational toy is very engaging . the only problem i have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the dvd player it takes several tries to get the dvd player to respond to the remote .
1	my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles . they 're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles . it 's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but are n't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles . there 's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge . the only downside are some of the very small pieces ... definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3
1	i 've heard no complaints from either one , it 's a hit
0	please . these things suck . oh , wow ! its got a 3 inch screen ! ! big deal ! my portable dvd player is 10.2 inches ; almost tripple the size of this ! the quality is pixely and crap , and you have to buy the stupid `` video now '' pvds . $ 14 for , what ? 6 episodes ? oh , thats so cool , as in not really . trust me people . stick to portably dvd player . yes , they are very expensive , but they will last twice as long . if you want a really good dvd player , buy the 10.2 inch insigna portable dvd . yeah , its $ 260 , but it is worth every penny . so , all in , if you are gulliable , and like blowing your money on a device that is better left in the store , buy this ! but , if you are like me , stick to dvd players .
0	i 'm sorry no as a matter of fact i am not sorry this doll looks like she can be in three six mafia video dancing in the background . who told mattel that this was a good idea ? is this mattel 's vein attempt to give the dolls an `` urban '' feel if mattel feels this is appropriate to teach young girls to dress like ho 's and teach them that their body is all that they have to offer then mattel has some messed up views of the world . honestly people this doll is not innocent looking it looks like it could be on that hbo documentary about hookers . what happened to the times when a kid could be a kid and play with a normal looking doll .
1	i bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib . he moves around a lot in his sleep so i wanted a safe first bed for him . he absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before . the only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high , so we just use the mattress for now . eventually we 'll put the box spring back in .
0	for the most part this is a good toy . it was actually one of the easier items i took out of a box this week : ) my daughter ( 4 ) loves it and as long as you can tolerate the `` mommy/daddy the wing fell off can you put it back on ? '' every 5-10 minutes then it really is good . i guess if your child is old enough and has the dexterity to put the wings back on by herself this toy would be great
0	with five kids under the age of 9 and four leapsters in the house , there is rarely a time when someone is n't playing one ( if not all ! ) of them . we have about 10 of the cartridges , and this was the most disappointing ( followed closely by spiderman ) . there simply is n't enough for them to do with it . the beauty of the leapster is the ability to interact with the games , and learn while they do it . watching a video on a 2 inch screen just does n't cut it .
