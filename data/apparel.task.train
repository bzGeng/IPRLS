0	i ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed , the 11 medium that i received was probably as wide as any eee width i have seen , and whats worse -these just sort of look cheap . i returned them , and i will avoid buying this brand agai
1	love hush puppies . they are comfortable and i can get a heel low enough for me to be comfortable
0	i was so excited to find these , they seemed the perfect combination of elegance and comfort . they look weird . they went straight back , and after paying shipping and return shipping , i practically have to pay them to take it back : -
0	my son picked out these shoes for basketball . he liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in , but the outsides of the shoes had no give . most shoe will form to your foot , these did not . at the end of third stripe , you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.we had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better . nice looking shoe , but not the greatest fit
0	the item looks cheap . i ordered a medium size but it was 2x bigger than the regular size . `` ugly
0	i wear boxers but boxer brifes look sexer so every one start wear boxer brifes that way you wont get pantsed or get a wegie
0	ibought these socks for the purported thermal heating qualities . i was still cold . just a regular average socks , easy to wash and dry so great for travelling , nothing more
1	i love this shoe ! it looks very elegant on the foot and there 's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus ! but make sure to go half a size up . it 's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in .
0	i have the same jacket in black but i bought this from elsewhere . what a rip off it is . it is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day i had to remove atleast 20- 25 of the feathers since they peek so much . i doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers. ! ! ! do not buy
1	i highly reccommend this bag for anyone ! it is a big tote , which is perfect for a college campus , the airport , the beach ... really for any purpose . it is reversable and i was very suprised at how durable it is ( great quality ) . when people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part .
0	these tops were cute , for my 7 10 year old neices . how in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things ?
1	this bra fits very well ( i found it fit very true to size ) and offers great support . i 'd much rather pay this price than the outrageous prices i 've paid for sports bras in the past that have offered no where near the support . it has held up well while jogging .
1	this is a great hard-side suitcase for the price . it is basic and simple , but seems quite durable and functional . i use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling , and it is big enough that the bike fits in , but small enough that the airlines do n't charge a premium for checking it . it rolls very well on the built-in wheels , and unlike it 's smaller cousin the oyster , this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance . the only reasons i did n't give it 5 stars are : 1 ) sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle , e.g . going through narrow gates on a subway or similar , and 2 ) the built-in locks are not `` tsa '' locks , so in other words , they are useless for air flight . i would buy this suitcase again
1	this is a great product that i have been puchasing for 15 plus years . can i order monogramed shirts from this site
1	great product with speedy delivery . the shoes arrived before i expected and were exactly what i wanted . thank you !
1	my son love these shoes , i have to stop him from wearing them so much , i just wish they came in other colour
1	these socks are absolutely the best . i take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat . ( not good in the middle of a side plank ! ) anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry . one note ; make sure not to order them big , the idea is that they should be snug
1	exactly as advertised . if you 're a naruto nut , or like wristbands , i 'd advise buying this
0	very disappointing . this product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose . the `` high waist '' was always rolling down . i was n't expecting miracles ; i just wanted to smooth out my silouette while i lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight . this product was completely useless . product has a clever name but that 's it . i really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item . look elsewhere .
1	well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got . and i was not to be disappointed . they are really awesome ! ! they are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play . i even wear them to office sometimes ; ) though after wearing them for a long stretch of time , i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star . but they are worth every single penny i spent on them . if you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too , look no furthe
0	bag was well made , but too small . ca n't put much in it . nice well-made leather bag . if it was three times bigger it would be a perfect .
0	these slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things i 've ever put my feet into . the concept is good , but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger . that might solve the length discomfort , but there still is n't sufficient heighth comfort . they felt like an all encompassing vise , squeezing my feet so tightly that i had to remove them to gain relief . very uncomfortable .
0	just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use .
1	these are the most comfortable boots i 've ever had straight out of the box . they look good and feel even better . highly recommended ! ! !
1	was shopping at the mall . this item caught my husband 's eye in the window . we went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it 's uses . we actually bought one for ourselves . it came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland ( going and returning home ) . especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight . i was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it was n't . we foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages . it 's a two-man operation . my husband would lift the luggage/bag , then i would look at the scale quickly
0	i love toeless hosiery , but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose i have ever worn . if i 'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly , and it gets worse when i stand . these are awful , i ca n't stand it . the only good things i can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose i have worn in the past , the toe thong does not bind , and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone , but it is so not worth the itching . also , they run rather large , the material does n't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees . i 'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs . and the smallest size is still too big . i 'll give hue 's a try and i might even spring for the donna karan toeless panythose , but i wo n't get these ones again
0	while they are certainly bold and noticeable -- and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information -- they are n't even close to being `` leather . '' i do n't think i would have bought them if i saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand . not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller
1	these were nice , lightweight budget jazz shoes ; however , they do not fit the same as street shoes , despite what the description says . my daughter wears a 2.5 in street shoes , and i ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth . wrong ! i have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5.5 . beware
1	this is the only shoe i wear for high impact jazzercise classes four+ times per week . i have a wide , flat foot and this shoes fit me perfectly . and with boot cut jazz pants , they look great !
1	this bra is the best nursing bra i have found . it is very supportive and comfortable . i like that it gives you the same support as an underwire bra but without the hard wire digging into you . it holds up very well in the wash . i would definitly recommend this bra to anyone that has a hard time finding bras to fit them .
1	i have just recieved my pair of boxer-briefs for my son . i took a kid 's review 's idea and got one size smaller for my son . i asked him how they felt and he said that they felt really good . i asked him if they give him enough support and he said yes and he even told me , i do n't know why , but he told me that he can get his hand down the boxer-briefs and take it out without the boxer-briefs streching and loosing their tightness
0	this was not the apple armband they advertised , it was a cheap foreign knockoff - i wish i had never bought it . terrible misrepresentation of sold item . buyer beware ! !
0	i thought i was going to save a few bucks and buy my next combat boots from amazon to get the cheapest price . the seller was totally fine , however the boots were total crap . the leather was unbelievably stiff and hard , so i thought i would just use a ton of leather conditioner ... about 15 applications and i do n't think it made a difference . i put the boots on to try and `` break them in '' - lost cause there , but in addition , nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether , first or second time trying the boots on . i would have returned the , except i had shined and polished , and oiled the boots so much . do n't buy , stick with altama or another military issue brand boot . i am sticking with my altama pair i have had for 7 years
1	i love these shoes ! the service was great , the price great ! these are really good shoes . i have a hard time finding wide shoes where i live . these were perfect ! very comfortable , very good quality . this is where i will be buying my shoes
1	i purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months . the shoes are very comfortable and look very professional . love them . strong and tough . not to heavy . has good grip on snow .
0	my son wripped his right away trying to put it on his psp he said it was hard to get to the buttons to play
0	these pants were washed one time , following the washing instructions , they were not put in the dryer , and they shrunk not only around , but lengthwise . i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems . i look forward to your reply
0	please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop . i received with battery problems , it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it . you have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner . the suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all
1	i only use the protective case/skin , not the armband or belt clip . i primarily wanted protection for the screen , which this provides . the screen protector and skin fit perfectly and were easy to apply . i can easily access all ports and manipulate all controls with them applied/installed . i have not used the armband , but it looks pretty sturdy . i paid $ 18.90 for this item including $ 5.95 shipping
1	this boonie hat is collapsible , yet has a firm rim . chin-strap is attached to keep it where it belongs in high winds . this is the hat that will conceal you in the woods , but gets noticed about town . the digital pattern is impressive can often times is a conversation piece . i wear it almost every day , and it 's my favorite piece of headgear
0	this case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth , the case is too big for a snug fit . it works , but i did n't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new ipod . real scam
0	i had several of these shipped to my mum in law 's in california for sending to me in france where we work and live . because of a decent delivery speed , and her thinking they looked ok , i gave them a rating of 5 stars . today , after even having boiled them in water , hoping for shrinkage , i am sad to say that nothing happened . they are horrid to wear , i oredered a medium size and the fit is that of xxxxxxxl . do not buy this horrors . i wish i could get my hard earned money back , as now i 'm wondering if i was the brunt of a joke in nightmare alley . you 've got to be con artist to sell these things
1	recipient was very satisfied with this blanket as pb are his initials
1	i was so impressed with the quality and correct sizing for this suit . my little guy looked so grown-up and handsome in his new suit ! ! thanks so much !
1	shirt looks good , its a tighter fit not lose . color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles
1	i highly recomend fruit of the loom mens briefs . not only i did grow up wearing their brand , but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs . if somethings not broke why fix it
0	i am so disappointed . its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size
1	plugged into ipod and guess what ! audio and video came out the other end ! a little spendy but what can ya do
1	i was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what i was looking for . i have more than three electronic devices that i need easy access to - and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices . the only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil . i do n't know how durable it will be , but i 'm hoping , very ! ! for the price , this is a good buy
0	i must not have read the fine print ! this shirt must be a childs size . it just fit . then one wash and way too small . how can this be considered an xl ? ? ?
1	this was inexpensive , attractive , excellent windbreaker . only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip .
1	these crocs are very unique . they have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot . they are shaped like a birkenstock , but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed . the closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort . i wear them just about everyday to work . i chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because i work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea . the ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation . and , because crocs float in water , they make great shoes for boating or kayaking . they drain well and dry out quickly , plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it . i know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time . they are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes . i wear them when i am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside . in short , the crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes . treat your feet and buy them today
0	beware ... ... ... ... ..this is a `` little '' girls camisole , and cheap looking
1	love , love , love gerber products and these are no exception . great quality and they are so soft . the only thing is that the 0-3mths are a little small so you may want to consider starting with the 3-6
1	the robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well ! the color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful .
0	a red star ! ? ! ? i bet this wo n't sell well in eastern europe .
0	i purchased this shirt for my golfer mom for christmas and had to return it . i bought an xl because she normally wears a 16 , but the shirt was about the right size for me ( an 8 ) . the quality seemed to be fine , but the sizing was very misleading
1	the price for the slippers was average- no big discount , but they arrived at my front door in time for christmas . that was a big plus . and my daughter loved them
0	they totally fell apart after wearing them 2 or 3 times ! i expected more having paid nearly $ 20 for a pair of slippers . very dissapointed
0	thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material , i ordered it thinking it was a good buy . when i got it in the mail , a week later , i was soooooooooo disappointed . the material is like paper/ potato sack material ... its awful.. like plastic ... i dont recommend u waste [ ... ] on this .. the jacket is stylish no doubt ... but the material not something u 'd actually wear.. so a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best . [ ...
1	i was so impressed with this shirt that i had to buy another for my best friend ! it is for her birthday , so i have yet to see her expression ! but since i thought it was awesome , i knew she would love it too . we are both on different bowling leagues and so far , everyone else got a kick out of it . my opinion , this is where we should get a good team together and order from cruisinusa . i would n't mind being a gutter gal , so to speak ! these shirts are awesome ! i give bowlingshirts.com 10 stars ! ! bravo !
0	while this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival , it does not function to transmit the ipod via fm frequency . it can hook to the ipod , cradle the iopd and charge the ipod , but it does not transmit . the product was made in china but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return . while i could probably process back through amazon and the seller , it is not worth my effort . all in all -- a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product
0	this tie winder is not only twice the size i was expecting , but it does n't work . after one attempted use , the lid no longer stays on . i would have returned it if the return shipping did n't cost more than the item
1	great boots . perfect for playing in the rain . great quality . i bought one size bigger that current size so they would last at least two rainy season . no problems for the kiddos to adjust to bigger size . we previously had the frog boots and they are still in great shape to be hand-me-downs
1	as a new 36dd ( ca n't wear underwire ) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market . for the past 5 years ( since my surgery ) i 've been searching for the perfect bra . i have finally found it !
0	i did not order any red drawstring backpack . there is obviously a mistake somewhere . i gave this one star because there was no other way to send this to you . someone is tinkering with my account . ronald kalica
1	i have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful
0	i am tired of companies making money off of fakes . the u.s. government did not buy their field jackets from china . these m65 o.d . green field jackets are not real -- they are a mid-grade reproductions
0	be careful , this runs really small . i got the 18-24 for my 14 month old , and it would fit better on an average 6 month old . otherwise , it seems of nice quality
1	the lands end 60/40 oxford is the dress shirt to own ! it is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product ! i buy nothing but this shirt , and have multiple shirts in each color made . i 've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since i was 16 years old in prep school ( 35 years now ) , and the lands end is the best . i highly recommend this shirt
0	i bought one pair of shoes and returned them , they were to large . bought another pair and hoped that i would adjust to the shoe , i haven '' t. i have worn the shoes now and can not return them . i plan to give them away to someone they may fit . i will never order shoes again , i learned my lesson.i agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.i believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price . i will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before i buy , as i have in the past
1	these are great goggles they are as good as sweeds but do n't leave marks . they stick to your head the same way . i have used mine in several triathlons and they are so easy to use and adjust if needed .
1	i got and love it . however , someone else 's product was shipped inside the box . it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box . the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it . i contacted them and sent it to them myself . it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy . i hope all that get things for others send it to them too ! you never know whose life depends on it
1	i have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so i was very excited to find these . i bought 4 pairs ( silver , bronze , black , and turquoise ) . they are beautiful and comfortable ( i walked around at disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight ! ) the sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast . i highly recommend both these sandals and amazon.com
1	boots are warm cozy . however , the color was much lighter than pictured ... not the end of the world . also , the shipping took longer than expected
0	i bought this item , and was very disappointed when i received it and tried it on . the mock crocodile leather looks very cheap ... the `` leather '' of the shoe is very hard and i could not wear it for more than 4 hours since it was cutting on the sides of my feet.. after which i threw the shoe in the trash ... .it was such a waste of money ... do not think of buying it..
1	this is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand-knitted from scraps , just like i used to do before i got bored with knitting . it 's squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me ; i just cut off the tag and people think i made it myself . ( do n't tell ! ) not high fashion , but very warm and comfortable
0	the tape did n't stick well - plus the packaging was misleading , the box said it contained 2 bras ( which you really need when the tape on the first one fails , you can try the second ) . i threw it away
0	i ordered both the cherry and black deer stags through sportman 's guide.com . when i recieved the shoes the cherry was polished and new looking . the black pair was dull and had no shine . instead of returning the product , as should have done , i tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes . all attempts failed . very unhappy with product . i have learned my lesson
1	purchased for our 6 ft 7 son and he is very pleased with them . they fit very comfortable and are long enough so that they do not come out of his belt line
1	i bought these for my husband . he went riding in 45ish degree weather and his hands stayed warm . he was very happy with them and i will be buying a pair for myself !
0	the fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful egyptian cotton , but the bathrobe was huge . it was more like a tent than a bathrobe . it was an anniversary present for my wife ( size 8 ) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18 . i was very disappointed that i could not have ordered at least a general size ( large , medium or small )
0	not what i expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong . even though i contacted the seller , have received no response
0	i was so happy when i found these shoes , they are cute and comfortable , exactly what i was looking for . but after about two weeks of wearing them , always with socks or pantyhose , they started to smell terrible . i do n't have this problem with any of my other shoes . this was so disappointing , i will either try to return them or just trash them .
1	i 'm taking off one point only because these pants do n't have the short/medium/long choice as other bdu pants do . i 'm buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline . for other bdu pants i could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31-34 '' and inseam up to 34-35 '' . for this particular style i was told over the phone that they do n't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35 '' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39 '' . i ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend . other than that i 'm happy with the product quality and the service i received
1	i 've been looking for black sport socks for a long time ! finally , a black comfortable , cushy sport sock of medium thickness . i 'm completely satisfied
1	i just do n't know where to start . there just does n't seem to be a way to describe the comfort . you will just have to try them on to believe it . my neighbor , mother , husband and i all swear by this product . accept no substitutions . attractive ... no , but the comfort will blow you away
1	for the price it 's a nice dress . check your size carefully . i 'm normally a 29 waist in jeans , usually size 6 , sometimes an 8 . i ordered a large and it fits with only a little room , but a medium would have been too small . slim through waist and flares out to the sides more than i expected it to .
0	the product is as described and i 'm sure for some ladies the product would be great . however , for whatever reason , the stretch lace bodice was irritating to my skin and , the material was more see-thru than i desired . the product is well made with no defects
1	i ordered this shirt hoping it matched 5 others i had bought at a store for my wedding party . i called the company , they explained the shirt in detail . i ordered it and received it promptly , and it was a perfect match . thank yo
0	i was very disappointed in the shoes i were them to work and within 1 hour then strap on them broke.i love the way they look but not the quality of them.i would take them in every color made if they were worth the money spent on them
0	i purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.i ordered 2 suits through amazon.com , but to my surprise the size 34 that i ordered in reallity is a size 28 , which makes it very unconfortable to wear . so becareful when ordering . look at the manufacturer 's sizing list ( very small letters ) to find the right size . by the way , i had to pay to return these items because i did not read the manufaturer 's sizing chart . not a happy camper
0	got the jacket . 65 % wool , 25 % nylon and 10 % recycled cashmere . when they say plus size they mean it 's the `` w '' size
0	this was my first online shoe order . i figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on . i 'm usually in a size 11 or 12 , so i ordered a 12 . while my feet are pretty wide , i 've never had to purchase wide shoes . these shoes were incredibly tight . they were long by about an inch , but the width was unbearably constricted . they reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- i really had to squish to get my feet in . the result was so uncomfortable , these are going back . i would n't have expected this from 'slip-on ' shoes . it gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great
1	the jersey of our # 54 got here for my wife in time for super bowl and she was very happy . ( with the jersey not grossman
1	i bought these shoes for my husband . i ordered them on a monday and they were at my house by wednesday ! i have owned a pair of `` real '' birks before and these look identical to them . my husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones
0	these shoes look great on , however are extremely uncomfortable . they run very small in size ( i went up 1 1/2 sizes from what i normally wear in sm brand ) . i would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot
0	this carrying case was a terrible purchase . the zipper broke within hours and the nintendo ds lite does n't really fit into it very well . i was very disappointed . my six year old used his own money to buy a g-pak case , which is a much better case for the nintendo ds lite
1	these boots are a great alternative to the military style combat boot . and the cost is less then when i purchased similar style boots when on active dut
0	i prefer the bibsters . the quality on the toss away bibs is not as good - the material is quite thin , the closure uses a sticker that never stays closed
1	i used this pair to replace my regular large fins . speedo fins worked quite effectively and gave me a good workout . the material is also good/strong . i have no gripes about this product . i will highly recommend to people who do not like to use regular-size fins
0	i 'm a 32dd , and while this bra does virtually eliminate bounce , i could get the same results with duct tape . unflattering shape , uniboob ( with the accompanying `` interesting sweat '' problems ) and overpriced .
0	until today , 01/09/2007 , i did not yet receive item hi-cut brief 7_8701_1176 xl/light beige nor bali lace trim moderate control hi-cut brief 8044 xl/light beige both purchased on 11/30/200
0	extremely dissapointed in the colors i received . out of 10 , 6 were black , 3 red ( 2 shades ) , 1 pink . i could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different ( and i mean different - not all red-toned ) colors , but not with what i got . useless . i 'm upset beyond words . will never buy from this seller again , and will not recommend to anyone i know , unless the seller comes through and fixes this
1	the sheets were just as described and worth the price . timely on shippng also . very pleased
1	these sweatpants are extremely comfortable , reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors ... definetly a great buy..
0	all boot is made with mademan materials . then they are not as comfortable as i want . with the same amount you can find a better option
1	i love these shoes ! they are so comfy and cute and keds is my favorite brand of shoes
0	on the advertisement , these sandals were shown in green . if they were available in green , i would be interested . please advise . thank
1	even if you could never see yourself wearing this . go ahead and get it anyway . this is great for under the football helmet for under the motorcycle helmet . feels good on your head . i have even seen wrestlers wear these under headgear so it must be good for that too . keeps your head dry . i also wore this under my mask when volunteering @ a haunted house
1	clever and stylish design ; a lot of colors to choose from ; and an excellent performance , best sport shoe eve
0	i ordered a 7.5 m which is what i always wear in a shoe . i could n't even get my foot into the shoe . i can tell you that it was way too narrow . i do n't know about the length because my foot would n't go in . i had to return them . i would n't buy another pair of daniel green 's until i knew for sure how the sizes really run . 0 stars
0	i guess you get what you pay for . the wand was cheaply made and the shipping doubled the price of the item . it reminded me more of what i would find in my cat 's litter box than a magical device
1	i purchased this bra on a special for 6.50 . well worth that price . i am thinking of purchasing more at the current price . very comfortable and great fit -- -- great everyday bra for larger chests ( i am a 38d
0	had a hard time using this thing . first it tore the loop off my tie trying to fit it in the clip , then it cut my button off the shirt sliding up and down the shirt . i went back to using my tie bar and tack
1	i got it on size 32 because i usually get my pants on size 32 . the bathing suit was too tight . i 'll get in on size 34 next time
1	we needed a ruch delivery for our vacation of some quality water shoes with a decent price , we were treated superbly . our order took less than 3 full days to arrive . we will use amazon again to fine deals and service like this
1	i do n't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones . fits my boy just right
1	i received these today in the mail and am pleased with the way these feel on my feet , they are so comfortable and so easy to slide on
1	great looking on my feet , extremely comfortable and the price for a suede sandal like this is phenomenal ! i 'm going to order more .
0	good socks . , nice material . but on the second day of using them one sock had a tiny hole in it . they are knee high and stay up , provide good warmth in the cold weather
1	i got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store , and i did n't realize how much i liked it until i decided to buy another one some time later , and panicked when i could n't make out the writing on the tag . i have been trying to find this dang bra for ages ! finally ! i found it again ! i am so stoked ! the one i bought so long ago is my favorite bra , and it looks pretty sad by now . like other reviewers ' bras , mine developed a split in the fabric , but it was only after many , many washes in the machine , rides on the bike , exercise dvds , naps , etc . i like this bra because it fits me so well , but also because the fabric is so breathable -- no cotton , so it dries fast ! it is really stable so i actually use mine instead of a sports bra , because sports bras suck . if i could , i would people the lingerie world with these bras . the only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related : do n't wear it with a sheer shirt ! i wish there were another version , `` opaque tapestry , '' maybe . then i 'd never buy any other bra
0	i was able to track the progress of this item , and it took almost two weeks after the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped . i also paid for 2 day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me
1	just received a pair of these deer stags from my father , really , never heard of them before . they are the most comfortable `` dress '' shoe i have ever worn . good for around the office , on the factory floor or in the field . slip resistant too
1	i love these shoes ... i have been searching for the right ballet/audrey hepburn style flats for years . i also love the price
1	my husband , the star wars fanatic , loves them ! very comfy
1	great overall shirt . good quality , wears well . wear it proudly
0	for starters , this shirt is not a lighter , royal blue like it is pictured ... .it is a very dark , navy blue . very dark . also , the sizes run big . every t-shirt i own is a size large ... ..this shirt is a size large , but is way too big . be warned
1	i love the look . even my friends complement it . and the wedges are so light ! but you got to stick to your size . i could n't find size 8.5 so i bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake .
1	it is a must have for all monty python and the holy grail fans !
1	once while traveling , i had a big blister on my heel and needed something that would n't rub my heel . i happened to get a pair of crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front . i was pleasantly surprised by the crocs - very cushiony soft , like walking on air . also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet do n't get sweaty either . i originally got the crocs for temporary use but now i look forward to slipping into them everyday when i get home . it 's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step . they 've replaced my slippers , mocassins , surf shoes and sandals .
0	these undies look very cute , but they do n't breathe and , well , let 's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear
1	i am enjoying the sneakers this summer . comfy perfect for elliptical trainer , stationery bike and weight room . very stylish , i love skechers footwear
0	i bought these shoes and they only lasted four months . the leather sole was really slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on . by the last month i had them , the sole had totally separated from the upper . i thought florsheim shoes were good ; maybe years ago , but not now . these shoes are not recommended at all
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
0	i was very disappointed with the pair of shoes that arrived . they appear used and have a small stain on them . as a result i will not be wearing them or ordering shoes online again . lesson learned
1	this bag is great ! very fashionable and protective of my laptop . great side pockets and convenient pocket for cell phones
0	good short sleeve shirt , but i ordered a long sleeve
0	the product was not quite what i expected , but i got a quick return to my satisfaction . happy shopping
0	i really wanted to like these , but they just wo n't stay put . it 's not a thong , but it will be after a few hours of wear . i usually love dkny products , so i am disappointed
1	i 'm a size 0-2 , i ordered a size small , if i ordered another pair i would probably get a medium , due to dryer shrinkage . they fit in every way , but they are so revealing i 'm barely comfortable going outside .
1	the shirt came fast.it 's a good quality shirt.i 'm satisfied with it
1	this is my first charles by charles david shoe . the material is good , the size too . the only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side , but it after 3 days using them it was ok . very nice shoe but definetly it is not a $ 100 dollars one , if you pay less than $ 50 will be fair
1	the beading on the bag is fantastic , and its very cute . the color is even more exquisite in person . it 's just big enough to hold id , a little money , and a lipstick , perfect for going out at night
0	this was a nightmare order.i paid extra for expedited shipping to assure christmas arrival.package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until after christmas -disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr.old grandson that his gift did n't make it.the shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed.they are also impossible to reach-amazon could n't even get them on phone.thank goodness the shoes fit-i ca n't begin to imagine what a return would have been like . the product is great
0	this product worked well in holding up a strapless bra , but after a few hours , my skin developed a blister underneath the tape . i would rather risk the wardrobe malfunction than have any more blisters , so use this product with caution
1	the belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price . very satisfied
0	i 've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months , wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full-time in the summer and very little the rest of the year . while the shoes are comfortable , i was disappointed at how fast they 're falling apart . the padding around the ankle has torn , there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes , and i was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement , `` the solid rubber outsole delivers long-wearing durability . '' that 's been my major complaint with these shoes ; shortly after i got them , the soles cracked at the heel , and now layers of the soles are peeling off . i recommend buying another model..
0	it 's very poorly made . zipper did n't work when it arrived , and when i tried to pull it , thread was torn apart and beads fell ... cheap stuff , should n't have ordered it .
1	this is my favorite for lap swims . reasonable modesty , but not baggy . you 'll move through the water with ease with minimum suit slippage . if you are not looking for a tan , get this one !
0	the material is nice , but the size is too small . i usually wear size xs for tops but for this tee , the sleeve is too short
1	do n't know where else to find a garter panty set ( arrived fast too ) for this price . they say economy , so was n't expecting much , but we 're still enjoying this set to spice up special evenings ! we bought the one size ( for a size 8 ) and it is perfect and adjusts
0	never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items . contacted seller and u.p.s . both told me basically i was out $ 45.00 . tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info . on their web site . live and learn wo n't shop amazon again ! thanks 4 nothing amazo
1	i have purchased other hats from well known companies . these hats are great for the money and are constructed well . good job !
1	the gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain . adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties ! it takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but i believe that all gazebos have the same problem .
0	i really really didnt like this product at all . i hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying , very hard to keep them tied . also i 'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off . the product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all
0	i liked the boots in the first couple of weeks-they are very warm and comfy , however they are not at all durable -after a month of use the soles had holes . my freind who had them experienced the same problem . they are great feet warmers when the weather is dry , but they are not waterproof .
1	i bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started . let me tell you , these boots are great ! ! ! ! ! ! i read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they 're a little big , regardless , i love them and another thing , they keep my feet very warm and cozy
1	see my review for the desert digital . i own both the woodland and the desert bdu 's
1	these are the most comfortable briefs i have ever worn . they are worth every penny , in my opinion . they are designed for a man , plus they seem to not gather moisture , as some fabrics do
0	i wore this shirt just once . it 's almost transparent . not worth it even if you get it for free
1	this is a great additional purchase to the princess costumes . just know for little fingers ( children ) they are hard to put on - requires parental assistance
1	the gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain . adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties ! it takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but i believe that all gazebos have the same problem .
1	i like this dress . i am medium sized and bought size medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown , with even a little extra . i think even if i would of get size small it would still fit well with more `` trim fit '' look . it is basically like a super long tank with body contour . nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on , but also want to look good in it . ( it is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend 's long tea-shirt , if you understand what i am saying ) . it is soft , comfortable , cozy , beautiful color . i am very pleased with this product .
1	yeh , these are really great socks ... but what 's up with james ? if new socks changed my life , hey i need to get a little something goin ' on . back to the socks ... my favorite , in black , low cut , workin ' out or hangin ' out
0	i ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards , grocery store cards , insurance cards , club cards , hotel cards , airline cards ... you get the point . i was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the `` accardion '' from collapsing enough to zip close . i ca n't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market . unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card , i would not recommend this product
0	the jacket we received had weird arms , they had a hole for the thumb , and then another for the rest of the fingers . great for skiing or snowboarding , but for casual use in florida winter was n't very practical . columbia in general is a company i swear by
0	i did not like this product at all . it is very hard to use and too small
1	i buy these shoes in bulk as they are so good . i have high arches and these shoes are the only ones that have never given me any trouble . i am now on my 3rd pair and use them for my marathon training and running
0	this is not a jockstrap . it is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity . i tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable , let alone not exactly hygenic ! no surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup . probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by rips
0	ok , i am not overly modest and 95 % of the shorts/pants i buy fit when i purchase and xl size . these shorts are made for anorexic bean poles . if you have thighs , legs or even a *tiny* bit of junk in the trunk , forget it . these are designed for 16 year old girls , not men . shipping is also super slow
0	acorn changed the sole of the slipper from a flat comfortable sole to an uncomfortable , rubbery , poor traction giving and painful sole . i rather have cold feet then wear this slipper
1	i bought this shirt as a gift for my husband , he loves it . it 's comfortable , fits well and looks new after multiple washings . along with my husband being happy i am very pleased with the service of amazon.com . i ordered one item from shop.com it took 20 more days then what they told me it would arrive and when i got the watch it was n't the watch that i ordered ... ... they do n't even sell the watch they were advertising . to top it off their customer service was not good , when i called amazon 's customer service they were very helpful and nice ! therefore you can understand how much i appreciated that the multiple items i ordered from amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated , the products were all great and the service was great !
1	i found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely . follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their scotchgaurding . tip : make sure you wash them before you wear them . i would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability , comfort , and/or needing a professional look in the garments they wear . note : if you are looking for extra pockets go the dickies cargo route . these do not have any extra pockets
0	saw these on sale at macys , on the rack , no box . figured why not , they felt good . but when i tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard . she said i looked like penguin butt and i have a waddle . i 'm going back to other boxer briefs . personally i did n't find them comfortable at all , and i like this style , a , dkny , ck , other jockey ... .i 'll stick to those..
0	i did realize that these shoes squeaked , but i did n't anticipate how loudly that squeak would be ! i doubt my girls could hear anything over the sound their shoes were making- i know i could n't
1	the shoes were in great shape , the shipping speed was fast , really satisfie
1	these were purchased for a wedding . the quality is very good . we would like to see solid black offered and argyle in black , pink , grey , and white . thank you , joy ree
0	this shoe is very comfortable , unfortunately i had to send it back to the manufacturer twice , the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are . i am very dissapointed as i have come to expect quality from merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks . i would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping
1	this purse has a lot of positives going for it : 1 . great design - the embroidery is very intricate and detailed and looks gorgeous . 2 . the color is very glamorous . 3 . it is a deal at this price ( although i bought it when it was $ 5 higher ) 4 . it is unique and i love it because i am unique : ) in short , i love it
1	i was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child . i had seen the aimee gown before , and i really liked the looks of it , and the reviews seemed great . after purchasing the gown ( was shipped via fed ex to canada , which means i got dinged by fedex 's `` customs broker '' costs ... ) i tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits . i purchased a size xl as i am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy . i have a normal bust size of 36d . the gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery ( does n't just stretch out and stay there ) , the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing , but the v is n't too deep ( nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle ) . there is a slit up the side for ease of walking , but it 's a very high slit , too high , i felt . the gown did n't fit well over my pregnant belly - but i do n't fault them for that , it 's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy . however , after giving birth , i still do n't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks , until the baby belly subsides a bit . the gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump , but unfortunately , as you walk around , the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump , pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg . the gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts , but it 's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher . the bustline will be great when i 'm nursing - easy to pull over , and great coverage on the other side . it fits well under the bust ( elasticised under the cups ) but i found the cups were huge on my breasts . it fit well at the band , but i guess they figure if you 're a big girl , you must have big boobs . luckily , i 'm handy at sewing , so i plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this . overall , i think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding ... . after the baby belly has subsided . i do plan to bring it to the hospital with me , but only after i 've taken in the seams at the shoudlers , and closed the side slit a bit
0	the nippits did n't really work for me and they were painful to remove
1	finally ! i 've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years . these enhancers are well-shaped and incredibly comfortable . when ordering , go ahead and get the b/c size . even if you are an a or low-b . these inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up . i personally recommend using a fashion forms pocket bra style 9400 or a playtex style 4300 . order a cup size above what you would normally wear .
0	i ca n't imagine who could pull off these clown pants . they 're unwearable ! what was hanes thinking ?
0	these are not ray bans ! they should not come up when i do a search for ray bans . get your cheap crap out of my search for genuine ray bans
0	i saw the reviews and ordered the bag , the first impression was it looked pretty good ! i was happy , if i had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars . the problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front . i had to trim to remove the hanging threads . there are double stitches on the bag . the clip just above the calpack symbol , has come out . i suppose the ring which holds it has cracked . do n't ask me , why i did not send it back ... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag , which does not make sense to send it back . it has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap ! the next time , i 'm going to branded bags , it is worth the price i guess . on the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok ! except for the defects on the front of the bag ( mentioned above ) . if u r lucky , u could have got a better bag
0	if you have a 60 gig ipod , this is n't 4 u ... it is way too tight , limits access to the click reel , and completly blocks access to the hold butto
0	suit was too small , not enough information available on the site for it . i called amazon , but even the customer representative was not sure the size . i bought the suit as he suggested , but it is too small
1	i love these pajamas . the color , the softness ( get softer the more you wash ) , and the fit . i had purchased these for an older friend and found i was n't able to part with them so i made it up to her in other ways . never done that before ... shows how much i like 'em .
0	these broke within the first 3 days of use . 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located
1	i 'm in love with these sandals . although they are very lightweight , they are vastly more substantial , supportive and comfortable than most flip-flops . i may have to buy another pair . if you 're a half-size , go down not up
0	need to use a belt definitively . does not look like the picture . if you do not use a belt , you will seem like wearing a pijama instead of a top .
0	i was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991 ; however , i had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had . the shoe is hard , uncomfortable , and much wider than the 991 . my foot slides around everywhere . i recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first . do n't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991
0	just did n't like the way they turned out ... .medium size ran way too big for me too . i did n't know how to return so i just kept them .
0	i bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none . in the photo , the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area , however , this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there 's no structure under it at all . the quality of the slipper 's upper is lower than expected , it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of `` wool-blend '' . also , one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after i put my foot in the slipper the first time . the rubber sole is substantial , though heavier than i like to wear in a slipper . all in all , i regret spending the money on these
1	i ordered these shoes the minute i saw them featured on a fashion segment on the los angeles morning news . i have a new-found love for flats and the more comfortable , the better . i recieved them in the mail the other day and ca n't wait until it warms up a little so i can wear them ( i 'm in cold chicago ) . they have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering , you could even dress them up . they are more cushy and comfortable than i ever remember keds being . i ordered my true size , 7.5 , and these feel almost perfect , maybe just a little roomy , but i 'm not going to bother exchanging them because i 'm afraid a 7 may end up being too small . i have n't owned a pair of keds since high school in the early 90s , nor have i tried any on since then because i was in denial of keds being cool again , so i could n't remember what size i used to wear -- but i 'm very , very happy with these shoes overall
0	plugged it into my wife 's car . set it , listened to 1/2 of a song , then went to remove it to try it in my car . the plug part broke apart in cigarette lighter , leaving part of the plug in the jack . returned it , satechi sent my refund quickly
0	i bought these for my mom as a gift thinking , `` hey , they 're cheap , is n't all shearling good ? '' not so much . the insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap . they were very sturdy ! not so comfy . they also ran about a size smaller than i ordered . i 'm a size 7 , and the 8 's were a little small for my feet .
1	great cap.. quality is top notch.. price is also great .
0	these underpants are too bulky and puffy . my daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them
0	i purchased a ipod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside . on the inside of the case they 've got some ruff edges that will damage you ipod screen . if you 'd like scratches on your ipod screen then purchase this case , but if you 'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then stay away from this case !
1	these shoes are proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
0	this cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long . the texture went bobbly after one day near the arms
1	i love these underwear . i have not bought them from amazon yet , but i plan to . i will wear them until jockey stops making them . i have worn these for the past 3 years , or so , and they are so soft and comfortable . highly recommended
1	i purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish/platinum color . they were so comfortable that i purchased two more pair in different colors ! the straps are very comfortable - they 're elastic and not tight or constraining . the shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes . i can wear these shoes for both the am and pm services to church , where i usually have to wear a different pair for the pm service because my feet hurt so bad ! it 's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels , so when you can find them , stock up on them
1	my wife has been looking for a pair of seamed pantyhose and did n't think such a thing existed . last week she wore this pair to a re-enactment and received many favorable comments . highly recommende
1	this is an outstanding shoe ! it has good support , looks great and cleans easily . the price is comparable to any good quality , kids ' , athletic shoe . an excellent choice for an active athlete who has n't yet grown into adult sizes .
1	nice shirt . very hard to find in stores so it 's worth the wait and the cash
1	the shoes are great . i love dansko , they are the most supportive and comfortable shoes that i have ever worn . i have 9 pair will buy more . the retailer was great . i received my shoes within 5 days i would shop there again .
1	my husband refused to wear slippers and it was driving me nuts that he walked barefoot all the time , he said he could never find slippers that were comfortable enough . since the red sox are his favorite team and the reviews were so good on these particular reebok slippers i thought it was win-win all around so i bought them as part of his valentine 's gifts . needless to say , they were a big hit , he loves them ! they are comfortable , modern looking and the red soz logo made his day . i would buy these for any sports lover with their favorite team logo on them
1	it clearly says it is a mesh dress ! i wore this for my wedding , outside in bright sunlight , and it certainly did not show everything , but do not expect it to be completely opaque , as it is a mesh dress with delicate lining . as for the quality , it wore well , and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design . very fairy-like and pretty , and i was pleased to wear it
0	i just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to not buy this product . it is made for smaller busted women in mind . there is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman . it was a trial on my part but i hope by writing this it will help other women avoid making the same mistake . stick with the strapless bras ladies !
1	this tee-shirt is my first under armour purchase , and i took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any under armour before . i 'm not dissatisfied , but it is n't my favorite tee-shirt . on the positive side : the weight of the fabric is good for exercising , especially for the gym , and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures . the fit is pretty good ( i am average sized and wear sizes 8-10 ) ; i do n't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it does n't look like i 'm wearing a bag . on the negative side : i am a little short-waisted , and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips , which i do n't like but accept . also , the vee-neck is not a very strong vee ( pictures of this shirt are true in that respect ) . a lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid . i prefer a true vee-neck . lastly , the fabric has a slightly rough , scratchy feel , which seems characteristic of today 's technical fabrics . it 's not clear to me that the cost in `` hand '' is worth the added function of `` wicking '' in this instance . overall , i consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run , but i would n't want to spend a lot of extended time in it .
0	tommy , what were you thinking ? although they are lovely to look at , they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe , bar none . the shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk , i even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem , i was wrong . take this design back to the drawing board and start again .
0	even though it works just fine like ipod ipod sock , it 's quite disappointed that this is not a genuine one . it 's acceptable thoug
0	a year or so ago , i bought several of these on sale . they are poorly sized ( i have 4xt ) , far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably . maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit , but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat , i 'd avoid buying these
1	great shirt for working out in . clears away all the sweat and is loose fitting
0	i absolutely loved this bra when i first put it on , but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm . i thought it was just a rare occurence , but i bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime . they cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them . i am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire
1	skechers just seem to fit my feet well . lucky me . these were inexpensive , solidly constructed , comfortable , and ( at least in my eyes ) stylish . what more could i ask for in a casual shoe
0	i had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions i wear . they are my son 's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room . he 's only 6 and when i had trained him i tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear . in my personal thoughts are that men's/boy 's underwear has a fly in the front for need use , unlike that for women and girls whom do n't require it
1	i love the garrick sandal . it was exactly what i expected as seen in the stores . delivery , and service was excellent
1	shirt really made a `` hit '' . arrived shortly after placing order
1	the fit is great . sexy slim look and feel . slight stretch to add to comfort and hugging feel of the denim . got lots of compliments
1	i love puma shoes -- especially the future cat low . puma is by far the best quality sneaker i 've ever had . the price of their shoes is a bit more than the average , but you get what you pay for . they are great-looking and are extremely comfortable . i am so pleased with these shoes that i plan on only purchasing sneakers from puma from now on . i 've bought four different future cats : dark shadow/persimmon orange , black/white/chinese red , white/black/vapour blue , and black coffee/white/burnt olive
1	i used these pajamas in the hospital after i delivered my baby and for the first 3 months of breast feeding . you can wear them without a nursing bra since there is a way to to keep the nursing pads in . they are also very comfortable . i wore them some days all day because they really do n't look like pajamas . i got them in blac
1	this is a great gown for the price . it 's comfy , soft , and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there . moreover , it 's sexy ! hope yall enjoy
0	i bought this as a gift and my friend has informed me that after two weeks of use , a pocket ripped so we will be returning it
0	in general , i do n't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals . i thought dickies would be the best , but found they are mostly like the others . after i received these , i ordered dove apparel , which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make
0	these compression shorts are nothing like the other pair of hind i have . aside from the low grade material and poor stiching , the waist band rides up around my chest ! it looks like they were designed for someone 7 feet tall
0	i got it a few weeks ago . although the light turned on in the charger ( indicating the electrical socket is good ) , my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/led light . i played around with it , but it seems it ca n't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days . i gave up and simply use my usb charger ( with the stable base ) hooked up to my laptop
0	i broke through the toe on the second wearing . lousy product
1	a friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood . i will never forget that day . the first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first . with stiff plastic boards attached to your feet , you wander around wondering why you 'd ever wasted your money . soon , however , they start to mold to your feet . they take on every bone , every curve , every nitch . the next thing you know , it 's like wearing a glove . perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you . as they age , they eventually start to smell , and you replace them and repeat the whole process . i love these shoes . however , they do not love me . after years of wearing them , the lack of arch support finally did me in ... i developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days . the pain lasted months . with time , and care , my feet are better . but i ca n't go back to these amazing shoes . my suggestion is to wear them sparingly .
0	this product is not what it is cracked up to be . i ordered it , and it does n't really work too well , i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better . there is not enough expansion room , its just like not really using anything at all . sorry , but i thought the product was not that good .
0	the glasses look fine ... from a far distance . they are produced very carelessly . given that it 's on sale , the quality can not be as high as normal . however , it should not that bad
1	this product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim ( so many types of luggage are similar in style and color , we 've had trouble in the past ) . several of our family members were given new luggage for christmas and these tags were included . these tags are big , bright lime green and can be easily seen . no more headaches in trying to find our luggage .
1	i 'm a big guy . heck , i 'll just admit ; i 'm a fat guy . however , i am also simply large-framed ( broad-shouldered , barrel-chested ) . i got the largest size possisble to accomodate my stomach and my large chest ( largest available is a chest measurement of 60 , my chest is 58 ) , and while the coat looks pretty good on me , the shoulders are extremely constricting and i have heard the seam in the back pulling if i move my arms too quickly or too far . if you have unusual proportions like me , i reccomend biting the bullet and getting a tailor-made coat elsewhere . still , though , the coat is quite warm and looks pretty nice on me , so if you are of relatively normal dimensions , you can add a star to this review when considering a purchase
1	this bra is very comfy and also quite sexy for a sports bra ! i am a b cup and am using it for low to moderate impact activities and have found it quite supportive and comfortable
1	good quality , well built vest of full bodied fleece . vest is slightly fitted at the waist for a feminine look and the arm holes are neatly close fitting to keep the warmth in . sizes run alittle large . i love my extra small vest and my daughter loves her small vest
1	ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase . i just wish it was n't `` hand wash only '' .
1	have always been pleased with this manufactures product . the company i purchased from was fair priced and very efficient
1	i , like many many others , ordered the 4811 and 4911 when i read the article . i ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24 . i knew it was going to be a long wait , and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they had n't forgotten my order , but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand . they always gave me the option of cancelling my order , since they do n't charge my card until they ship out the order . i almost did , but my order finally came 9/10 , and i must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs i 've ever worn . i 've already placed another large order , as christmas gifts for my friends !
1	swimsuit very cute - size as stated ( 16 = 20/22 ) bra did not have enough support for me so i wear a matching sports bra with it and it works very well . i love it
1	this is not a basket short or soccer short , no ! ! ! ! it 's a very very nice beach short or just to sunnys day specialy in my country ... with hot beaches all year , and beatyfull shopping mall near you can use this shorts for both activities.. that 's why i bought it and do n't mess the shoppin
0	i bought this shirt last yr for my husband . it lasted about 6 months . much pilling ( those horrid dots all over the fabric ) , and seams coming un-done . after about 3 washings , it looked like i had bought it at goodwill , used . i would n't even give it a 1 star rating . plus , you will get advertisments in your snail mail from this company forever . their advertisments/photos cater to gay men.get ready to see some very unusual attire . not that there is anything wrong with that . ( loved that seinfeld episode
1	fit is perfect . very comfortable . 4 stars . would purchase again . mary s
1	the zipper wallet is a product with a practical idea that is long overdue . it is a known fact tha all leather wallets stretch resulting in important items such as credit cards and drivers lisence , etc . slipping out , making identity theft a serious possibilty . the zipper wallet avoids this from happening . ironicly , this item is not available at local stores.i encourage everyone to try this product and see for yourself how useful it is in the everyday world yours truly ; joe alvare
0	i bought this from motherhood and hated it ! ! ! it is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones , which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and do n't need more help ! ! the mother ez belt was fabulous though ! ! i wore it for the last 4 months ! ! ! forget about this one though ! ! !
0	there was no 'draw string waist ' and it didnt fit , complete waste of money . ( yeah i realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither . ) didnt fit actual description was off and 'ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever , point being i didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when i was out of town and didnt have time to return it . ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me . just be smart .
1	columbia sport sandals for kids are great ! we 've bought them three years in a row now for our kids . they hold up well , are comfy , and the colors are great . easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze . they 're well constructed , but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while . they wo n't really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size
1	the wand is sturdy , full-sized and nicely designed , even if made of plastic . the kids wanted their wands so they could play `` harry potter '' , so this was much more appropriate than the beautiful but more fragile and very expensive collectors versions available
0	the little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after i got the sandals . i have had these sandals before and this did n't happen . maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower , and thus more fragile , nubs . all i know is , they are junk
0	this jacket is soft and almost luxurious . i am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood , it split and tore under its own weight ! ! ! ! i think this says it all , no ? i would , unfortunately , not buy and american apparel item again . they are usually sized way too small and now i see the quality just is n't there . greener pastures ... ..
1	birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet . i found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking
0	the sound works but the light does not
1	been purchased many pairs keds shoes , very stylest and comfortable . me and my mom love them
0	this is very cheaply made , from very poor quality fabric . the styling is not good , and the fit is poor.it does not resemble the photgraph . i would pay ( at most ) $ 5.00 for this dress
0	if you return items amazon will charge you for shipping both ways whether the product was satisfactory or not . do n't buy from amazon
0	i received the smart tool dynamo instead of the illuminator . very disappointed because i ordered 5 for xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder .
0	this is a very pretty , high quality leather shoe . the wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow . if you are going for looks only ... they are good . if you want any kind of foot comfort ... skip it
1	i was looking for a wrap to go with a black backless dress . this scarf was perfect . it added just enough color with a little sparkle and was plenty large to use as a wrap . very pretty
0	i have several pairs of genuine birkenstock sandals . the betula sandals are clearly inferior . a light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into . t.h . grov
0	our company ordered these shirts from the texas shirt company . while we were happy with the quality , our order was missing 2 shirts . over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know , but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for - as if to say we were not telling the truth . if you do n't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good - but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company
0	do not buy from this company - i ordered and paid for this and never received it !
1	great pants . i bought these in a variety of colors and i am very satisfied
1	the shawl was beauiful and just the right color . an excellent value too.very good product fast shippin
0	these body suits are awful ! when i first saw them i was really relieved that i had found something that would be good for the summer months . i put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs ! the suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label . i am so disappointed and angry . it was a waste of my money .
1	we are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season . unfortunately , the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from amazon after sending 4 emails . we do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching . we have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company , but we can not get anyone to respond . we will never order anything through amazon again
0	i am not happy with what i got in the mail today . i thought i was getting a real used fencing foil . instead , i got a kids plastic fencing sword ! sending it back asap to get my account credited for sure ! why is a real sword picture used to sell a kids fencing foil
0	i have had plenty of pairs of doc 's but these are not the best for me ... ... ... .. they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in . as soon as i put them on and took one step -- -- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease ... ... ... it does not look nice and i am `` ticked '' about that ... ... ... ..plus i didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces ... ... it looks dorky ! plus i have a manufacturing flaw in them . inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck ! hopefully the next model i get isnt like thses or they are going back ... ... . putting up with these for now ... ... .
0	the shoes have sparkles all over and do n't serve my purpose . i ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle . a nice shoe to use during the night
0	hole in pocket , not completly sewn . charcol heather shrank 2 sizes . blue shirt pocket was placed almost under the sleeve
0	the sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body . my husband is 6 ' 178 pounds , so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit , but this one looked like a stiff kite on him . be aware the items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money , and only after i had filed a complaint with amazon . amazon acted quickly to post the credit .
1	i love this purse ! i just wish i could get it in the emerald color , too . i have the magenta .
0	i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy i made a mistake by buying i
0	verynice looking however i had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks . it was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date i 'm not so sure it would keep someone who write 's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing . side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other had n't been a problem . the service was excellent from belt outlet . arrived in a normal amount of time.. very courteous when i called and explained why i would be returning
0	all i have had with this product is problems . the clip in the middle , kept popping open , even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out , so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever . do n't waste your money
1	i bought these in black and got a ton of compliments as soon as i started wearing them ... however i recommend you wear these with sheer stockings or something because they gave me a blister the size of mt . everest , ouch
1	i purchased these socks from a large department store in chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks i had . it took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort i went to amazon and found them in a second . i have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks i have in my drawer . i am hooked on hue plus size and it is so easy through amazon .
0	i would n't order from andrew christion again ! i ordered three shirts more than a month ago . they sent only two and never responded to my emails ! where 's my shirt ! ! ?
0	i have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away . the shoes look cheap , not typical of the nine west brand . i would not purchase this item again . i thought i was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work .
1	before this bra , i would have to wear an underwire bra , and a sports bra on top to minimize bounce . my cup size is f , so it 's been difficult to find a sports bra that i can wear standalone . well folks , i found it . this is the bra ! ! i wore it while doing turbo jam today and it was amazing ! it did better than the two bra combination ever did . if you 're looking for a sports bra that actually works , this is the one
0	i ordered these for my 21 year old daughter who attends juilliard . they looked terrible because they were shiney . the worst part is that the company will not allow a return or exhange .
1	great item ! have already used several times and is exactly as is described
1	speedy delivery product as stated would buy from them agai
0	not worth the price at all ... the bead work looks very cheap ... the color does not look the way its shown in the picture . decided to return it the moment i opened the box..
0	i do n't think these skechers are made out of leather , so i 'm very disappointed . i thought i was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer , but with such a low price it was `` too good to be true ''
0	these boots where definitely a disappointment from kenneth cole . they did not resemble leather in the least . they looked terrible on me ; maybe there is someone out there that they would look good on .
1	this product is really great for this sansa e260 i purchased . strongly recommend it this mp3 player . it helps grip , bottons work better , and looks `` cool ''
1	i love this boot . it 's high , and the platform will make those unaccustomed a little teeter-y , but it 's a great look . the leather and detail on my pair is exceptional . green leather inside . i really like these . and i own 55 pairs of shoes/boots - know from whence i speak
0	this shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining . the people who like it must be quite thin , indeed . it does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it does n't breathe very well , either . i am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices , though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me . for the price , you can do better , even at someplace like target
1	wow.. what ca n't i say about these shoes ... i 've bought two pair in different colors absolutely love them for their comfort and snazzy , fun appearance . they 're great at work and at play , and even during outings that require alot of walking . highly recommend ! !
0	i bought this shoe and had to return it because it was so narrow i could n't get it on and i do n't have a narrow foot
1	we have always bought stride rite shoes for our son , however the cost can be overwhelming when you are buying a new pair every three months ! i was excited to find these here at such an awesome price . they are identical to those in the store and my son loves wearing them .
1	i was very pleased with the socks . they were just what we were looking for ! thanks so much
1	these shoes are great ! my daughter tried to talk me into giving them to her . quick delivery . good quality
1	this is an amazing product . i bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature . believe me , there is no comparison . not only is the halo product made better , and is more durable and holds the baby better , but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too . i trust this company because the product is recommended by the sids society . i do n't have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle , because he is so secure in it .
0	the color that i received and the color that was online was not the same . i shipped it back . had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself . tried to resolve through hungry lion , but they claimed the color was never shown online , when it was . hungry lion did say i would get a refund on the item . still have not checked to see if i have received credit yet . still waiting for my statement .
0	first i tried these pants on in my size and i looked like kramer in that episode where jerry dares him to wear jeans . it was ridiculous . i went back to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans i 've ever owned .
0	did n't like the way these boots fit . the souls were really lumpy and you could feel it when you walked . they also looked really wierd on , they flattened out really wide and felt like your foot would slipp off of them sideways . returned them and paid for the shipping myself
1	absolute gems . simple , versatile shoes that are fun , comfortable , and have great casual style . i have them in red , wear them to work , when traveling , and the one time i got stuck in a surprise seattle snowstorm , they even had traction . nearly an all-purpose shoe .
0	i received the night gown , tried it on , and actually hated it . the built in bra was loose , as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top . the straps are too wide . the rest of the gown was okay , although it too seemed too drapey and long . i sent the gown back 3 weeks ago , now , and have still not received a refund . i am very disappointed with the whole transaction/product
0	i have to say that i was disappointed when i opened up the package containing my ipod wallet . it 's cute , but not $ 60ish cute . first of all , it 's not leather , it 's nylon . the lining is indeed suede , but the photos in the product listing are misleading . i 'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back , etc . is n't worth it . it does the job , but it was n't what i was expecting . i feel ripped off
1	my boyfriend loves tommy socks but they are impossible to find in new mexico and i have looked everywhere for them . i gave them to him for christmas and he thought they were the greates
1	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn . the high top really supports your ankle and the shoe itself is form fitting and not one of those big bulkly tennis shoes . it 's light weight and flexilble , but still supportive . well worth $ 30 .
0	i found the wallet to be cheap looking and much smaller than the picture lead me to believe . to call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product . this is more of an insert to a wallet , consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket . i was n't pleased with the purchased , expecting quite a bit more the $ 14 i spent . i can go to target and get a wallet for less that what i paid for this one and it will be a full wallet , not a sorry wannabe
1	i have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times . they are very comfortable for me , though comfort is highly variable for each person . the material is light weight but appears of good quality and i do not detect any deterioriation . at first i was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak , but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine . i will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles . about the same time as i purchased these boxers i purchased a couple pair of faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material . one pair of these ripped recently . my experience is the ck material is holding up better than the facconable that costs twice as much . i doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others
1	this is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra ! i live in the us and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line . it 's a fabulous bra . it 's very comfortable , washed up nicely and provides great support . this is our second child and i wish i had these with the first
0	it doesnt fit well . the joystick doesnt function right with it on . the buttons are difficult to use . the product was poorly mad
0	this camisole did not fit my purpose . the idea is great , but it did n't fit me correctl
1	i 'm shocked i forgot to write a review about these jeans . i love these jeans . they are by far my favorite jeans . the fit is perfect and allows for room to breathe . i love wearing these jeans with my boots on a daily basis . i ca n't say enough about them . i tell everyone about them . even for a petite woman the fit is far better than anything i could find in a local store . i am completely satisfied . they also have a very modern look to them
0	the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes . i have used it about three or four times and i do n't feel it will last much longer . what there was of it seemed to work well , but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use .
0	this is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now , even appearing in one episode of `` leave it to beaver '' in the late '50s , and on the cover of one of simon and garfunkles albums of the late '60s . i 've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers , including red wing . some comments which apply to this style in general , ( and not just wolverines ) : pros - the wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete , or walking long distances on hard surfaces . also , the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass does n't track into the house after doing chores outside . the moc toe tends to breath through the seams , so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot , dry conditions . a great boot for the desert , and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers . cons - the wedge sole does n't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep , loose surfaces ( which i 've used them for , but for which they really were n't intended ) . gravel will roll right out from under them . none of the several brands i have owned were water-resistant at all . walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly , as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily . we used to say `` your feet get wet two days before it rains '' . so , perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the pacific northwest . specifically , the wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box . they have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style , a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support . the color was actually more of a brown clay , rather than what i would call tan . the quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good , actually better looking stitching than my red wings . however i was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather . the leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick , however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than i have ever seen in any work boot , thinner even than in many suede sneakers . while my ankles were covered , they did n't feel at all supported or protected . after considering for a couple of days , i decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for amazon , the sportsmans guide . they had provided a return shipping label in the box , so i taped the box closed , applied the label , and took it to the post office . i received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package , and a notice of a credit applied to my account . so , while i 'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which i received , i do give good marks to sportsmans guide for a quick and relatively painless return . i ended up purchasing the georgia spr 6 '' farm and ranch boot , with wedge sole , also available through amazon . for further details , please see my review
0	these shoes were very cute , as i thought they would be from the pictures . but because of the sides being so short , they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking , especially when going up stairs . i returned them after only wearing them for 1 day..
1	my 11 year old wanted these shoes . all her friends at school thought they were so cooland want a pair . plus they slip on and off so quick and are great for pe and the palyground . i would buy these shoes again , without a doubt . keds makes a wonderful product and i think she 'll out grow them before they even think about wearing out . great value for the money .
1	tis jacket is super handsome and is very comfortable . the stitching in the sleeve had to be mended but that was an easy fix . good deal
0	these socks have an excess of thread bundled at the corners of the toe seams . if this sort of design bothers you ( as it does me ) , then these are not the socks for you . these socks cause a lot of discomfort for me
0	also , item shipped is not item pictured
0	the title says it all . this product does not offer much in the way of control and it is definitely not firm . basically you are spending $ 35 for a high waist brief
0	if you like cheap furniture you 'll love this boot . the slave labor used to make this boot was wasted
0	the top was very roughly finished . the end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place , because the seams on it were very rough , so i had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be . the top got completely ruined on the first wash , i followed the instructions to a `` t '' during washing but still the blue on the top ran and i had to throw it away . the skirt is still fine after washing it twice but i would not recommend this outfit to anybody
1	munsingwear is definitely the most comfortable , best fitting men 's brief i have ever worn
1	i absolutely love this case ! the cool thing about it is that it does n't look like a regular laptop case ( i.e . the bulky , usually black , boring , case ) . my best friend did n't even know it was a laptop case and fell in love with the bag itself ! it makes a great gift for any soon-to-be college student
1	purchased this for my son . he loves wearing it ( he 's a big fan of ny and the pd ) . fits well , washes well
1	i originally wanted the orange colored tsubos , but they were out of stock , so i decided to go with the pickle color . i absolutely love em ! the comfort and style are unique and satisfying . it is because of shoes like this i have become a shoe expert of sorts
1	well , since i will be using this soon , i believe it will be just perfect . holds all the necessary items safely , so will let you know when i return from my trip
0	my wife has purchased and worn this style for many years ; however , the items received were nothing like the picture . the pictured item was exactly what she wanted , lace waistband at ( not below ) her waist and high-cut leg openings ; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different ( and unsatisfactory ) fit . she 'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return
0	in my previous review , very happy to receive my kc shoes but to my surprise these were a `` disappointment '' ! very cheap looking , there were some visible defects ( noticed right away ) , too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn . tribeca 's are my favorite kc shoes but again , if you wear a 9 , go a size up for a better fit and comfortability . good luck , shoe shoppers
0	perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely , or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description . the fact is , i thought that i would be receiving 84 plastic stays ( 3x28 ) , 28 each in 3 different sizes . at $ 8.00 , that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays . what i got , and i confess that the product description could be interpreted this way , was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes . when you add in the $ 4.00 i was charged for shipping ( actual us postal service postage on the package was $ 1.84 ) , this really is a poor deal compared to other available options . about 43 cents for each plastic collar stay ? a bad choice
1	these wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price . and they were delivered faster than expected
1	i love these boots ! i got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect . i can fit pants in them or over them and i have not had a problem yet
1	i bought this for my husband and am so impressed . nice and thick , and incredibly soft and huggable . i have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores . the attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise . sturdy shipping box , and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required . there was even a hand-written thank you note included . i am more than satisfied .
0	the jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive . the elastic and threads bite into your skin . if you use this one for sports , you will constantly be distracted . the feel of the material used is very rough against your skin , esp at the waist
1	all my gold toe socks are excellent , but these offer extra room and are extremely comfortable , especially after the first washing . i am about to buy another pair ! the trellis style is the other wonderful gold toe sock for comfort
0	i ordered a small , it is huge and has shoulder pads that are on my elbow
0	very poor quality , falling apart at the seams . also really long .
0	i would have loved it if they sent it , but after over 2 weeks of telling me that it was in stock on it 's way , the company fessed up that they were out of the color that i chose . the other color that they wanted to sub . looked pretty bad so i cancelled
0	although the description of these booties says they run true to size , they do not ! i ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter 's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet . now i have to pay more shipping for an exchange . not a great transaction experience
0	these shoes were not put together very well . the bottom of the heal part broke of and was bending inward from the second i put them on . if i had the choice to buy this breand again i would not . these shoes were very over priced and not put together well at all . i am very disappionted
0	i thought this purse was cute but upon receiving it , i was disappointed . the purse is black with silver buckles but the stitching is a gold color and does not go well with the rest of the purse . also i have tried to return it and have not been able to get a hold of anybody to help me
1	looks very nice , material is not bad..just a little big from my original siz
1	i ordered the cranberry watch cap and the matching scarf for my daughter for christmas . she loved the set as it is light weight and not bulky for packing for her honeymoon . the great choice of colors made it difficult to choose only one
1	this company gave me very good service . they called me personally a couple of times to make sure they had everything correct . i was a bit diappointed that in the bigger sizes the selection of color is n't large but that is okay . they were out of granny apple and so we had to get red
1	i was very , very pleased with the sailor outfit that included a very nicely made hat . it fit perfectly and was ahit with mom and dad upon seeing him at the airport on their arrival home from being deployed for 6 months . i found this same outfit about 25.00 more on other sites and so you ca n't do better on this buy
1	this was exactly what my husband had admired in macy 's . i paid $ 25 more for the convenience of having it delivered to my home without my husband 's knowledge . he is thrilled with the jacket
0	i love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when i buy them . i had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared . in two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched : one hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle . it would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon was n't properly sealed/melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven . the handle came about half-way separated from it before i stopped using it . this is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization , quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag . i would advise victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price . some of us are ready and willing to pay a higher price for a quality product .
0	i wore gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks . i discontinued using them because i started wearing different styles than the crew/white/standard . now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes . perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management . in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic , making them basically worthless . yippee
0	i wish i could give them -5 stars . i got these to replace a pair of new balance 999 that i had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $ 170 should be really good . i could n't be more wrong . the lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day ! ! ! stay away at all cost
1	these thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight . they are also a shiny patent material . these are the pluses . the one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot . that is , the toe piece seems a bit long . i kept them because i know i will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house . i also do not think that they are really worth the price . yes , they are tommy hilfiger , but the name is all you are really paying for . they are an okay shoe , overall - not my favorites
0	within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money , without requriing that i ship the product back . for that i am thankful and appreciative , and can recommend the seller . i have no idea what was up with the product . as i noted earlier , i just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum , literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home . i bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them . i am contacting the seller to request a refund . if i succeed i will note that in the review and increase the star rating
0	great concept , but they slip off my ears way too often . often enough that i stopped wearing them
0	it clearly states for the shell material 100 % nylon . the price and the nylon shell was the main reason i bought the jacket . the jacket is completely polyester . the tag says shell : 100 % polyester and lining : 100 % polyester . returning it would be pointless . i 'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information
0	i take no pleasure in this review . i just received ( march 2007 ) my 3rd pair of vasque sundowners . i 'd used up my gtx sundowners ( 4th pair of vasque boots ) that i 've had for about 3 years . this is the first pair that squeaks . i like good shoes , and i like taking care of them . i had always been proud to wear vasque , but the quality of these is just not that great . the leather is thinner , and is dimpling , so they even look cheaper . it 's a shame , i wish red wing ( another brand i`ve enjoyed in the past ) had not acquired vasque . it is the end of a great tradition
1	i have been a fan of asics shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate , which puts a terrible strain on my knees and arches . asics duomax technology allows me to run comfortably which i love to do but stopped for many years due to the strain on my joints , until i found these shoes . i absolutely love these shoes they have helped me regain the confidence and comfort to enjoy running again . this is the only type of shoe i will ever buy and has been the only one i have bought for 7 years now ! i highly recommend this shoe ! especially if your feet tend to overpronate
1	these are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs i 've found that are actually designed with a `` pouch '' , making them the most comfortable on the market ( of all the brands i 've tried , that is ) . unfortunately , they 're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets , and you 'll probably have to purchase them from an amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges , but what can i say . i guess it 's worth it . the briefs also run about a size small . i have a 31 '' waist but the mediums are too small .
0	there was no picture of this selection , so i guessed it was a `` ringer '' type t-shirt . instead it was a white shirt with ugly red contrast stitching . i never wore it , but gave it to goodwill
1	i liked the shoes , they look nice , my only concern when i first received them was the quality of the cover leather , at the begining it looked like plastic . but otherwise they fit perfectly
0	a ) the quality is not that great . b ) the socks are not skid proof . but its good to have 8 pairs because somehow the curse of missing socks will hit babies socks too . sometimes they pull them off while takig a walk , at restaraunts , friends ' homes , and sometimes the dryer eats them . :
0	i got the shoes for a while and i must say it was a total disappointment ! the look and heel were ok , so does the gtx xcr . however , there is a major problem : the shoes wo n't hold your foot ! the opens for the shoes lace ( the tounge ) are too big so the shoes wo n't hold your foot intact . this is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe . hate it ever since i put it on . i have total of 3 pairs of gtx hikers now and this one is the one i regret to out money in
0	i bought this shoes with the hope to give a surprise to mi wife , my surprise was that the shoe size dosent match , i 'm really pissed off , if you gon na buy this piece of junk , beware with the size
1	this is n't a review of this product , so much as it 's a review of the impression it makes . anyone who was in paris around the turn of the century will remember aubade 's `` lecons de seduction '' advertising campaign , of which the image shown here for this `` tanga '' was a part . each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of impression ... and is n't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for ? nothing has made a stronger impression on us
0	pants were strangely short and bodysuit extra long . also there was a tear in the sleeve of the bodysuit . the quality of the fabric is poor . it served my short term purpose , but i would n't purchase this same product again .
1	the price for the bundle is the best part of the whole thing . [ ... ] doesnt carry these products . they sell an adapter and then a usb cord . which is what apple does for their ipods and is a rip off for money . i like not having to worry with an annoying adapter when i want to charge my zen . just plug in and walk away , not fiddle with the adapter to make sure it is inserted properly . the case is abit annoying . it catches lint like you wouldnt believe . but i 'm not getting scratches and i have a kick stand ! i use that kick stand the most - its actually the main reason i bought this set . the bundle actually also arrived a few days before the zen actually did , so it was sent fast . i love this . get it
0	did not fit well at all . way too big around the ankles - every step i took , the boot would start to fall off . they were the right size , length wise and all , just way too wide above my ankle . they were about half as tall as they looked in the photo , which was very disappointing . i sent the boot back at my own expense the same day . i would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first , then ordering it off of here for cheaper .
1	see title . these shoes are simply the best pair of foot protectors ive ever owned . so comfortable , waterproof and just sweet-looking . i feel like a ninja every time i wear them
1	i purchased this bag to take on a tour of greece and was pretty happy with it . i loved the size , not to big and not too small , and also the flatness of it . it was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible . the only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body , the strap tends to rub at the neck , so i had to keep adjusting it every five minutes . overall it was pretty good , though
0	i think that these shoes are very sassy , but i ran into one problem ordering them online ... they are n't true to their size . i always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on , my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes . order wisely
0	do n't bye thees . they do n't look like orginals . they are really small , so it looks like glasses for children ! ! it 's just waste of mone
1	i bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open nearly to the waist , and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little , nobody would be able to see anything . the nude ones were practically the same color as my skin , so they were perfect . they also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold . the best part was , they did n't feel weird at all
0	i received an email from amazon asking me to review this item i had purchased . this item never arrived from macy 's . i emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and i would have it in ten business days . 3 weeks later i still didnt have the item . i contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available . my account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item
0	these jeans were so very disappointing . after hearing about pdc many times , i was excited to own a pair . but these jeans were made of cheap , uncomfortable fabric and the style just does n't work . i wo n't be buying pdc again
0	these boots look good on the first wear . i bought the black patent boots and after one , not so wild night , they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material . if you need boots for one night , for that perfect outfit , these will suffice .
1	the megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes . it has a nice feel to it . the bathrobe is made of japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100 % cotton . cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable . i purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected . overall i am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if i had the choice to do so .
0	i love nine west shoes , but these boots are not made like nine west . it did n't help that when i received them they were damaged . i purchased 3 other pairs of nine west shoes from amazon and love them but these boots stink ! !
0	i ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product . i received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame . that is where the only star i am giving is coming from . i am concerned with having a good supportive bra . i have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years . this bra is the farthest thing from supportive . i had to cut the straps and re-sew them to make them shorter so i could even where it . the material is soft , but thin and stretchy . i have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and i will not again
1	i bought this because i needed something to run in as well as use as an `` all around light weight jacket '' this does the trick , very light , great in the rain . i am very pleased with the product and the customer service was top notch
0	straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro , they are too short . i tried to add velcro , but that did n't work . i had to give the shoes away . the strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable . would not recommend if you are on the heavy side
0	i purchased what i thought were `` deals '' from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed . to get a pair of decent fitting sweats , you have to pay the price , and you wo n't regret it . i hope this advice helps
0	these shoes are very comfortable , look great but i had a terrible problem with the `` ruggedness '' of these shoes . i am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that merrill is known for , ruggedness and great outdoor shoes . after only owning these shoes for a month i noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole . this happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair . the insides ripped from slipping them on and off . i returned the pair to the store i bought them at and got a new pair . the same problem happened . these shoes are very cheap and very expensive . do not buy ! they look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only i would stay away from them
0	i did n't pay much for these , so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect . wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag . they repel water from the outside just fine , but they also keep it in . they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them , but that is hard to do . in a pinch , go for it , otherwise , invest in something better . i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them
0	this shirt was larger than i expected . i got a 2x because i 'm a 12-14 , but it was way too big . also the pink was a lot brighter than pictured
1	these shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts , but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it . the construction is very sturdy , and the pockets are a great bonus . i loved the first pair so much that i bought a second pair
0	be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards . i bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards , my id and some cash . hence , there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet . from the picture , it looks as though the business card side is just a slot . whereas , in reality , it is actually a pouch ( like most of the other card holders ) . other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother ( which takes up quite a bit of space ) , the leather itself is very low quality , and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it . furthermore , on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was made in china . i mean , china is great and all but if you 're on a date and you say `` hey , let me pay for this , '' and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying made in china , well , you are pretty much a schmuck ( i cut mine out with a pair of scissors , but there are still some remnants ) . so if you like being low class , by all means , buy this wallet . i personally do n't care about my wallet very much so i am keeping it and going to use it , but i almost returned it . it is most definitely a solid 2 stars . hope this helps
1	i bought this for my daughter . she is into pink and camo ? ? ? anyway it is a quality product and the daughter just loves it . what more is there to say
0	when i got ordered these shoes , i was so excited because the picture looked so nice . do not be deceived by its looks . i saw it in another store , and i tried it on for fun . the shoe fits poorly , and its actually really ugly . i would definitely not reccomend it to any one
1	it is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys ... instead of me carrying them ! ! !
1	good color visibility ; nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan north . the hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again . i have ordered maroon but will likely add some other color choice , as the array is rather impressive . for an 100 % acrylic knit , this is not a bad hat ; the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily , almost as if it were a hair-vacuum machine .
1	it is exactly what i was looking for . i had no problems ordering or receiving it . i got to my house quickly . nothing is wrong with it
1	this is a really soft , and very comfortable pillow . it is priced great , a lot cheaper than similar microbead travel pillows . i am very satisfied
1	i bought another of clark 's sandals a few years ago , which is why i ordered them again . these sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair ! there was no break-in period with these shoes..i just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters . i will buy more in other colors i 'm sure . you ca n't go wrong with clark 's
1	i got this handbag for my 14th birthday and i looove it so much ! ! it is so perfect , the best chanel handbag there is . everyone that saw my new handbag loved it and asked where i bought . i actually bought it at nordstrom . everyone should have one ! ! buy it
1	better than just a beach tote , sturdy bag for any occasion , good price
1	esta tienda es muy rapida en contestar y enviar el producto adquirido . es toy muy contento con el producto que adquiri por que es exactamente lo que deseaba .
0	i bought this a size smaller than i thought i needed , but maybe i would be happier with it if i had bought it 2 sizes smaller . i really do n't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of `` firm control '' . sure , it 's comfortable , but i was expecting some kind of control . it does smooth out some , but not at all what i was expecting..
0	i found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim . still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it 's worn the more it loses shape . the shoulder straps i did n't find had enough support hooks for lift up . i personally would n't recommend this bra
1	this suit is exactly what i ordered -- small enough for training/racing but not as small as a `` traditional '' speedo suit
1	i am gratefully pleased with product and vendor . . . very pleased
0	i purchased this as a gift for a teenager . she told me that it is difficult to zip as the fabric gets stuck in the zipper . it is being returned
1	of all men 's silk pjs that i purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best . the fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well . after reading other customers ' reviews , i purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size m and occasionally l. it turned out too small . i would recommend going one size up
0	this boot looked so much better online . for this boot to be by nine west it looked very cheap . i was very disappointed with this product that i returned it but i 'm still waiting for my refund ! !
0	first of all , they dont even go up to the thigh ! they attempt to sit right above the knee ! ! second , they do not stay up at all whatsoever ! ! ! i was sooooo embarrassed - i went out with them on and every ten seconds i was pulling them back up ... .. i am 5'3 '' and i weigh about 125 ... .i 'm average - these are a joke - price is too good to be true - do not bu
0	the scarf itched my neck , smelled funny and was not the color of ivory . it was beige . it is not cashmere . it would not itch if it were cashmere
1	having sampled 100 % cotton pinpoint shirts both on-line and from the stores themselves , my husband keeps returning to his favorite , the land 's end pinpoint . without a doubt , the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary ! now , when its time for new shirts , we do n't think twice and go directly to land 's end and order . they also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all
0	i wear a lot of rockport shoes . almost exclusively . i was very disappointed in these shoes . they are the same `` size '' as all of the other rockports i have , yet they are too small
1	i have received countless compliments on these rain boots . i love them , and i guarantee you will too ! they are comfortable , stylish , and keep your feet dry in snow and rain . what a great purchase
0	i 've purchased several of these bras in the past from qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here . though i was suspicious , i ordered one anyway . not surprisingly , the cups puckered when i tried it on . never had this problem with any ordered from qvc . when i inquired about returning it , i was disappointed to find they have a no return policy ( though not posted anywhere i could find easily ) . i believe this company sells '2nds ' though does not advertise that fact . i will not purchase from this company again , and i am now leery about purchasing through amazon in general
1	the boot is beautiful , but because my feet are wide they are uncomfortable to break in . the price is reasonable . hope to wear soon
0	the sizing on this cardigan is way off . i ordered a women 's medium and it looks like a child size large . the sleeves are about 4 '' too short and the overall profile is far too small . to make matters worse , i ordered it as a x-mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and i 'm stuck with a bad product
0	i have a pair if clogs from europe that i wear in the operating room . i need to replace them . they are european size 50 . so what 's the deal ? you do n't make your shoes in men 's sizes . you think we all have girley feet ? get with it , clowns . real men occasionally wear clogs too . you ca n't make a size 16
1	raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt . good quality for the price . i usually wear a medium but ordered the xl and it 's a good fit ( fitted but not too tight )
0	it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces . look at tunebelt . they have one that fits pretty good
0	the non-functioning illuminating speckles on illuminite products quickly disappear despite following care instructions . if you pay less for their clothing than regular clothing , go for it . if you 're paying more , you 're wasting your money
1	i bought these shoes for my 23 month old son . we needed something comfortable with a flexible sole , but with enough thickness in the sole to stand up outside and provide traction . they are excellent shoes and he loves them . he wo n't wear anything else and the shoes receive many compliments
0	based on the prior reviews , i fully expected to like these . unfortunately , i do n't , and wo n't buy more . they do n't stay up . i do n't have particularly large or small calves , and do n't have that issue with my other athletic socks . oh , well , buy and learn . i bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing
1	fit well . great for all kinds of athletic workouts . i 'm ready to buy a couple more pairs
1	this is cute , funny , and it 's not uncomforable ! i think it rocks ! i love this movie ... i even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth
0	the fabric is a little stiff at first , bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes . the elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric . after a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable . while cheap and nicely packaged , these things suck . spend some money on decent underwear
1	these socks are wonderful . just the right weight , very comfortable and warm . do n't fade after washing , etc . etc . i purchased 6 pair two months ago and have purchased 6 more
0	... ... ... ... .they sent me the wrong size ... and did n't leave clear returning guidelines . you are better off getting something cheaper , because this sure as hell wasnt worth the buck
0	i give the order processing an a+ due to receiving the product within three days . the bag , on the other had , leaves a bit to be desired . while the material used is soft , the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand
0	while i ca n't agree with the other reviewer re the quality of the 560 jeans ( it seems excellent to me , having owned six pairs over the last two years , which i wear to work every day ) , and certainly as men 's jeans , i do n't think they 're `` out of style '' , i do have to say amazon 's price on this item is far , far out-of-line . you can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $ 38 ( with free or cheap shipping ) , meaning the cost is nearly $ 20 less than what amazon is charging
0	the one size fits all does n't fit my slim body ... and the item looks `` made in china '' if you know what i mean . rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong . they look much `` classier '' than the transparent beads with nylon string of the `` string of bubbles '' panty
0	these are the absolute worst things i have ever bought . serves me right for by a sandal without ever having tried it on . i walked around the block from my house with them and barely made it home they hurt the bottoms of my feet so badly i may need to take an extra day off of work . the part of the sandal where it might normally be flat and cushioned has sharpened plastic spikes knifing the sole of your foot . take your money and throw it right into the garbage and save yourself the misery of ever having worn these so called sandals . and i love adidas
1	awesome handling while balling on this shoe . great grip on the court and i especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet
1	they are exactly what i was hoping they would be . i love the contoured front pouch . all the web sites i saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal . i would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit . my wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel . i ordered 4 different pairs of unico 's and they 're all good quality and look and feel great
0	the item is not my concern ; i still have not even received it
0	for $ 30 , i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoe
1	with a good selection of colors to go with the casual style , to say i love these shoes is an understatement . they are very comfortable , and have grown on me so much , they are about the only casual style shoes i have bought in the past few years
0	it did n't meet my expectations ... ..it was flimsy and wrinkled , and looked messy
1	a really nice looking t-shirt that was made to show an archeological dig revealing an unearthed artifact ( a gibson les paul guitar ) . i 've had nothing but positive remarks about it every time it was worn . i 'll probably order another because something this good usually goes fast . a really good led zep shirt is hard to find and this is one . highly reccomended . 5 stars .
0	this suit fits like a true italian size - i ordered a 54 which equals a us 44 approximately . it fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise , the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should , even though the body length was normal for a regular . i think these suits are defects/rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long . so i would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves
1	having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans i finally found this one . i ordered on-line , and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through amazon , verifying that the size i ordered was correct . the person i spoke with was very friendly and helpful . she helped me decide that i needed a larger size and i 'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size . i love all the pockets . it has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable . and best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing . the outer shell is also very soft .
0	i was very dissatisfied with this purchase . the material feels like paper and the seams were all crooked . then , when i returned it , i got an ugly email . keep looking ; for the price , you can find something of much better quality
1	i love the sweatshirt ! it came exactly as pictured and in time for me to wear it for the super bowl
0	i wore these socks once to a wedding ; they had a `` run '' in them within a couple of hours . admittedly it was an outdoor wedding , involving a longish walk on a dirt road , but it 's not as if i was crashing through the underbrush ( i was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up ) . bummer the socks got ruined so fast ; they were really pretty : - (
1	it 's a very durable bag . i run trails a lot and i was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season , durable as well as comfortable , and cheap so i do n't have to worry about ripping it . the straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders . the part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills . and if you need it for books , the padding will keep the books from poking your back . i would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though . i expect i will tear it to shreds eventually , but for the price it 's worth it .
1	not all bras are created equal . but what makes it so special ? as a fuller figured female , let me explain the merits : 1 ) support - it does a great job . this bra does not sag over the course of the day . your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning . 2 ) coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people do n't see what you do n't want them to see . for starters , the fabric is thicker than any bra that i have ever owned . and no , this is not a padded bra , the material is just thicker . since the material is thicker , it means that it is truly opaque . not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed . 3 ) comfort - this bra is quite comfortable , especially considering that it is an underwire . i have not experienced the sensation of underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders . but on occassion i do feel some pressure from one of the straps ( hence the 4 star rating ) . now there are a few things that may give you pause . 1 ) price - this bra averages $ 60-65 in department stores , not a cheap undergarment . 2 ) size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size . what i mean is that the bra has a defined shape ... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded . and there is more fabric that connects the cups together . a good descriptive word is `` substantial '' , but do n't think bulky . this bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines . this is an undergarment that i intend to buy again ... and again ... and again
0	i have found gerber brand clothing to be disappointing . the do n't stand up to laundering very well , in that they shrink quite a bit . they already seem small for the size on the label , but it gets worse after you wash and dry them ( even on the `` delicate '' cycle ) . my 6-week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3-6 months ! it 's worth spending the extra money for a better brand , such as carter 's
0	these gloves should really be called `` simulation leather '' . they are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather . i wouldnt feel comfortable riding a motorcycle with these , if you hit the pavent with them they 'd probably just vaporize .
0	i thought i was on the same page as crocs when i ordered the pwclog . it confusing ... i thought i was ordering a sale on crocs . they are not crocs..
1	i have a wide , relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit . bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me , so i have been loyal for the last decade . i ca n't find them in my area , so amazon is the only channel i use to get them
0	i had to send this item back twice and still havenot recieved the correct product never order anything from best price center , the owner denied being the correct contact after i spoke with him multiple times at the same number .
0	the shirt fits well , good style , good shirt . but bealls of florida sucks as a retailer . their customer service is rude , crude , and unrefined . even the supervisors of customer service suck , they do n't return or accept any items back . so beware , you better be damn sure that size fits ( ordered product before ) . because bealls of florida will not let you return the item for different size or style . i will not shop here again ! i repeat , i will not shop here again . this place sucks as far as a retailer
0	i had to send this item back because it was to small . the sizes run small , so beware
1	great company to order from ... good product and got to me faster than any other order
1	i really liked the black tuxedo outfit , my son wore it in a pageant and won , so i am very very happy about that . the tuxedo fit nicely and looked very nice on him
0	very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color . it does n't look as nice as what they show on the internet . i returned it for a refund
1	i was concerned that these silk pj 's would be really thin and on the cheap side . but to my surprise , they are much thicker then i thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well . my husband did not expect these and is quite pleased with them . i am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that i know they are worth the money i paid for them . plus the fit was perfect . i noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size ... and another person said the opposite . ( that confused me when i went to buy . ) so i just went with my husbands normal size which is a xxl and it was absolutely perfect ! : ) my husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of pj 's ever . the size is perfect , color bright looks like it will hold up after many washings . seams looked like quality sewing unlike some i have bought in the past . i ca n't find anything i do n't like about these . i need to get another pair here fast before he wears these out . lol anyone thinking of buying these i ca n't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least . ja
1	these are great girl socks ! besides being economical , they feel good , wash good , are very stylish , and do n't fall down ! they look great with jeans and khakis . i have ordered several more pairs , in different colors . a true value
1	i bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them . these are some great looking shoes .
1	these are the coolest things ever made . i have been searching for a product like this forever and i could only find what used to be called `` lingerie helpers '' from the 50 's or 60 's ( i think ) which did n't quite do the job . no more buying those `` speciality '' bras that cost a bundle or those racerbacks that did n't quite fit right . i just put these on my favorite bra and do n't even know it is there . now there is no excuse for me to ever see anyones bright pink bra straps peeking out from their shirts . i am just jealous that the woman who invented it is going to make millions and i am not ! ! !
1	i love this bra ... just the right amount of support . order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo ! !
0	why ? i do not know . but be more carefully anbout it
1	really nothing to say about this product ... fast shipping , good deal . i like the style and the color . not too loud
0	the quality was very poor , it was very wrinkled and to thin for a mens winter sweater . i send it back
1	this is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price i paid with an amazon discount . be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though
1	i bought three pairs of clarks from amazon when i saw the $ 20 coupon and as usual , scored with free shipping . clarks ' quality is tops and the prices were great , too ! i got these in earth color . they look really good with jeans . comfy with or without socks . the soles are gon na last a while . these have some nice cush to them , and provide good support to my high-arched , tired feet
0	the zen cover did n't work that good . i had to cut off one of the flaps that covers the `` buttons '' because it was not made right . i ended up taking the cover off and do n't even use it anymore . it 's not worth getting
1	my child slept with these shoes on the first night he got it . i allowed it because he has not worn it outside . of course , he wore it the following day to school , rode his bike with it and just took it off at the end of the day . very comfortable and cute shoes . i might get a pair for myself
1	i initially recieved my order very quickly , within a week in fact . however , it was the wrong size and i had to send it back to them . it turned out it was another 6 weeks before i got back the correct fitting corset . the good news is with my wedding dress , it is perfect , however , if you are planning a wedding , make sure you get this item way ahead of time in case there are any issues with sizing or back ordering
0	item send was not new . obvious that it had been worn befoe paint on zipper had worn of from use . also a rip in the design
0	this is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material . the footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it . the price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from i decided to return these sandals
1	very comfortable and feel . no one makes it like under armour
1	the bundle can be worn on warm and chilly days to support my favorite college team and alma mater . material is good for both the t-shirt and hoodie . for the quality and price , ca n't beat it anywhere
0	`` classic '' sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking , ( and now `` spinning '' ? ) i hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans , leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor . dangerous for working out , and certainly not `` classic ! ''
0	i had a good experience with 80s purple last year , so when i needed prop glasses i knew where to look . i got my order , the glasses were scratched and the frames were damaged . i called and they said they would send me a replacement right away , i was quite pleased . it has been over 3 weeks and i have not received them , i have called and emailed them several times with no response . not even picking up the phone . i plan on contesting the charges on my card and will not be shopping here any mor
0	the views do not show the belt and buckle . i can not tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side . why does this matter ? for me , it 's vital information . when i 'm backpacking i carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack . of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle , over the navel . if the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other . a few manufacturers are wise to this conflict . they make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset -- between the left hip bone and the navel . the two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other . i wo n't be considering this product because i can not discern the photograph
1	if you purchase this slipper for your man , he will love you forever . they not only look great and very expensive , they are super comfortable and he absolutely loves wearing them . they look good enough to wear to the supermarket . barbra willi
1	very cute tops , for a nice price . they wash up good . they do run a little big , just so you are aware
0	i actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening ! i knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me . i could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool . but , the description said it was trimmed in geniune `` pig skin '' leather . when i recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag . the trim was some type of weird plastic aswell . it was the cheapest and most fake looking bag i have ever seen ! i could n't believe that amazon was selling this product for $ 200 ! i love amazon and everything they have to offer ! they really should n't put there name behind this product anymore . any faithful amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step ! i know i was ! ! !
0	i 've ordered from this seller before and the dress i recieved from the previously was perfect . while delivered promptly , this dress was not as it was pictured . the bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill-fitting . unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it , it 's basically too unflattering to wear .
1	i bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites . my husband loved the way i looked in it . i must admit i was not that sure i wanted to buy something like this online ... mainly because i am extremely picky with the quality of the things i buy ... and also because i tend to be between sizes . but i ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me . i am very pleased with this seller . the order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition..
0	i have had plenty of pairs of doc 's but these are not the best for me ... ... ... .. they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in . as soon as i put them on and took one step -- -- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease ... ... ... it does not look nice and i am `` ticked '' about that ... ... ... ..plus i didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces ... ... it looks dorky ! plus i have a manufacturing flaw in them . inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck ! hopefully the next model i get isnt like thses or they are going back ... ... . putting up with these for now ... ... .
0	i purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her nintendo ds lite . the case does not fit at all and i have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game
0	i see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper , which is why i bought it . i see now that the description has been corrected , but too late for me . also , the sizing does not run true as the current description states . i usually wear 9.5 , but i have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes
1	these boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts . because they are real leather , i was expecting to have to break them in before they were comfortable - but it only took a few wearings before i could wear them all day with a lot of walking and no sore feet . did n't have any problem with them fitting my calves . i had that problem with other boots i have tried before . even if you do n't consider the great price for all leather boots , they are wonderful buy
1	when i bought these shoes i did n't know they would look so pretty . i am glad i bought these shoes
1	these are my new favorite boots ! the detailing on them is gorgeous and although they are quite high heels , they have a bit of a platform so i do not feel wobbly at all on them . i 'm really happy with my purchase
0	after six months of little use , the inside heal fell apart on both shoes . the fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates . do not buy this shoe
0	i purchased two scarves and in the first washing the thread in the hems unraveled , producing a ragged fringe all around . these bandanas are thin , flimsy , and not worth the time or money
1	this shirt is very cute , but you may want to order it in a larger size than what your child normally would wear . my child normally wears a 24 month . i ordered the size 2 , and it 's much tighter and shorter than her other tops
0	it was very kind of the company to refund the items when i had to send them back . but the quality of the shirts where not the quality i am used to have when i buy orginal van heusen shirts
1	both our son and his wife and myself are very pleased with the undershirts . it was very difficult to find the shirts that openned on the side , so i appreciate them being offered on your site and will remember the brand in the future .
1	these are the best ever ! i bought these for my daughter and at first was nervous about ordering something like this online and because i had seen similar 'crocs ' at local stores for far less . well , these are worth every cent ! my daughter and i went to a local store and she compared the way these felt to the local brand ... no comparison ! these are the best
0	i love these boots and get a lot of complements but the strap broke already ! can i send them back
0	i have worn jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time . the product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching . two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them ! i shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings . given the cost of panties and other similar products , you 'd think the quality would be decent . however , jockey is n't the only company out there with a substandard product . i guess until i can afford to spend substantially more for panties , i 'm stuck . i will only pay sale prices
0	i bought 2 lilyette embroidered minimizer bra 's here and both of them broke within one week . i have never had such a negative experience with a product before . where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment they broke right away . since i do n't know how to get my money back or an adjustment , this cost me approx $ 60 for a loser of a purchase . my suggestion : do n't waste your money on this one
1	i purchased this tuxedo outfit w/vest for my son who was in his aunt 's wedding . he was 18mos . at the time . it looked wonderful on him and fit nicely . the pants were a little long but other than that it fit very nicely on him . the tuxedo was true to size of my child . fast shipping from retailer as well . i was very impressed overall
1	this is a great idea that is not apriciated until you go on a long trip and end up with dirty wrinkled clothes that are all thrown into a bag . this keeps clothes seperated and organized and easy to repack if you are moving from place to place
0	the product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . i requested xl long pants . they sent size 3x pants . so they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . i would never order from them again
1	this was a great purchase , and i love keen shoes . my only complaint is sweaty feet when it 's hot , and the shoes do n't dry out very quickly
0	these gloves should really be called `` simulation leather '' . they are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather . i wouldnt feel comfortable riding a motorcycle with these , if you hit the pavent with them they 'd probably just vaporize
0	this is a cheap and flimsy armband . not the one in the picture . there are much better on amazon for less money
0	i ordered the black one . according to the photo provided , it was supposed to be black with white seams , but when i received it , it was all black . once i put it on it fitted perfectly . but it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size .
1	nice shoes , cut a bit high in the back so i got blisters at first- love the fabric and color-prompt shipping and nice bo
0	i received wrong item , but there was no service after that
1	calvin klein provides a fashionable , comfortable underwear . tight but not too tight , it holds you in place , while not constricting you to a tight position . excellent , but do n't buy them too little
1	this was a christmas gift for my friend 's husband . he really liked it and said it was excellent quality
1	these boots fit like a glove and are so sleek looking . they are comfortable and a great buy . a nice pair of black boots is essential to any wardrobe
0	nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ? it looks good but is it 4 '' x 8 '' or 12 '' x 8 '' ? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy ... ... ... ... . da trol
1	i love this laptop tote . it 's big enough ready to take to the pool
1	this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers . the last ones stayed with me for three years . they are so good , i stopped using the `` big , home set '' and use these type daily . heat up fast , great lasting curl ( particularly for hard to curl fine hair ) , and do n't even need to leave them in that long . would have given them a 5 - but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl . recommend getting or using a set of the old-fashioned wire clips that come with most non-travel sets if you want a smoother curl
1	i 'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability . i just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in arizona to wear them more often :
0	these shoes are no longer being made in italy but in india . the quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be . i have worn this same style of bostonian ( marco ) for several years , and was completely satisfied . this is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great , comfortable , well-constructed shoe . return to having them made in italy !
1	i have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me . once again lifestride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes . it fits me very well , looks great , and is comfortable . the color , wild rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown . i do recommend the shoe , and of course it is available in other widths-so it is not just for wide feet
1	i have arms like a gorilla , so i was pleasantly surprised at the length of these sleeves . they fit even my appendages nicely . i followed the advice of the other reviewers and i 'm glad i did , for the large is a perfect fit on me , and i 'm pretty slender . the material is fairly thin , but not see-through . overall , i say this shirt is a good value
0	cute shoes , but extremely uncomfortable . i am not sure that i will get much wear out of these shoes . i know my size but i starting to think they sent me the wrong pair . i am so frustrated with amazon where shoes are concerned . this is the 3rd pair of shoes i have bought that does not give me a good fit . i suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big , it 's a catch 22
1	once my best friend described my bra size as `` beige . '' meaning that when you shop in the `` full figure '' section of a department store , you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny 's closet . most of the bras are beige , with some black or white ones , and all are gigantic and ugly . if this sounds familiar to you , then this is the bra for you . it looks pretty , comes in a variety of colors , and i at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences . the cups do the supporting , so the bra does n't need to have those super-wide , heavily padded straps . and it gives a good silhouette under clothes , but will also look nice by itself
0	i had got these for my husband for christmas . nice material , however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height , so we had to return it
0	... the shoes were n't quite what i thought they would be , although for 40 bucks i probably should n't have been expecting the highest quality pump . they looked a bit cheap , and on top of it all , they were too small for me . there was no return slip in the package , no number to call , no way to send the shoes back to make a return , so now i 'm stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into -- and they 're a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening . my fault for buying shoes at a place called `` hollywood heelz , '' i should have known better . i will say this though , i like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion . if i could fit them , i 'd give them a 2-2 1/2 for that alone
1	this item was just what i was looking for . i did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband 's ties or a tie bar . it is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving .
0	the leather on these gloves is soft and supple . and they 're warm thats about all that i can say that is good . there were scuffs when i got them . the stitching was ripping ( and finished itself off soon after ) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove . avoid at all costs .
1	i have purchased several shoes from nine west and for the price these are very comfortable boots and of good quality . i would highly recommend them because they are the kind of boot you can wear all day long . the calf of the boot is very generous and the heel height is exquisive for walking in fashion .
1	not as pretty as i hoped on my feet but an overall great shoe and fit . do not regret the purchas
0	i recently purchase ''better bottom padded panties ' ... l was really disappointed.like most women i always wish i had a bigger and more curvy bottom but was really disappointed when it arrived . the padding was made of cheap foam material and it was very visible under clothing even denim ... ladies please dont waste your money . iam really gutted because i bought some new trosers and i was hoping to wear the padded panties underneath it
1	they shipped these almost overnight . my daughter was a perfect little flower girl ; no trips , no blisters , and they 've held up great over the past 9-10 months with great durability for dance and lots of play . she was a size 10 at the time of the wedding , but the shoes were a 9 ? her feet were fine . she can still squeeze into them now , and she 's an 11 . very pleased . good value . these are the exact shoes
0	i like how smooth it is under t-shirts but the size is out . i ordered my usual 34b but found it too small . 34b fits in other brands so i know it 's not because i 've got bigger
0	you ca n't beat this shoe for comfort , but they 're definately cuter in the picture . i thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel did n't quite seem to fit the shoe . i returned them .
1	ordered these bra extenders since i an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things , and they are working great ! recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as i expected ! thanks !
0	buying this was a mistake . this bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt . the straps are not comfortable , it 's cuts deep into the shoulders-it should be atleast padded . def . not what i expected from this product . the material and pattern is the only thing i liked ; it has a sexy look to it
1	i am happy with this bag ( i got the pink and white one ) . it is a lovely color , nice size , durable and good price . it comes with an outside pocket and i received it quickly . my only complaint is that almost $ 7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was $ 3.99 , otherwise i highly recommend this bag .
1	i have had a pair of these for several years ; they were an incredibly lucky find . they 're *extremely* comfortable , better than many pairs of sneakers i 've tried on . they 've worn very well , and i 'd say they 're well made : i 've only had to replace the shoelaces once . a bit of polish , some kiwi leather cleaner and protector for water , and they 're perfect . trust me , you can walk for miles in them , and they look great , i think . a great purchase . if you 're looking for a pair of dress shoes , and nervous about buying them without trying them on , well ... my feet love them . do n't know how far that will carry yours , but there 's my two cents . excellent
1	awesome shoes . not necessarily worth the outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless . i 'd recommend them to anyone who takes running seriously , and who likes to look even cooler when doing it .
0	like every review before mine , my order was wrong as well . the picture is incorrect and needs to be updated . i waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design ... .yes it 's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund . i strongly feel that if amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner . is this just another big uncaring corporation ? this experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with amazon for anything again
1	very comfortable . better quality than most . good rubber sole and lotsa fur inside . sizing appears to right on for me . i take an 11 shoe and the 11 fits just right . the laces actually do tighten them up and pull the back up so my heels do n't pop out as normally happens with a new shoe . i doubt they will last very long outside , but who wears slippers to the store ? ? highly recommended !
0	this has been the complaint of others i see , but there is no sizing information for this product and consequently i can not purchase as i do n't know what i 'm getting
1	very pleased with all aspects of this transaction . price , delivery and quality all excellent . recommend seller highly
0	shipping was quick . the shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer . when soiled they clean up well . some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most . the little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip i was doing alot of walking the feet were really swollen . i am pleased with the shoes so far .
0	i was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra - i loved the cotton , one-hand closures , and the lack of underwires . it felt and looked great when i tried it on , but after a few hours of wearing , it had the classic problem of riding up in the back . eventually i gave up wearing it at all . i bought mine in a boutique where i was professionally fitted , so i had the right size ( 34f ) . i 'd recommend a bravada bra for larger sizes , they consistently fit great and stay put .
0	i wish there was a rating of `` 0 '' . this was very flimsy and the armband is just slightly larger than the slot provided . the armband cut through and tore the back completely off . i am returning it
1	i really like this case , it fits so perfectly that the zen does n't rattle around or anything , yet all the plugs and buttons are still accessible . easy to get on and off , too , and looks great
1	these t-shirts fit on the small side , for women ( not juniors ) but are soft , comfortable , and well made . i have bought 4
1	this shoes are very lovely , classy and comfortable . i 'm thinking of getting them in another colour
0	it is ironic that you would send this to me . i can not tell you how excited i was to purchase these slippers . i had bought everyone in my family ugg slippers for christmas . everyone had cozy slippers but me ... ..so instead of paying over $ 60 i found this pair of warmbat on amazon . i researched the brand and thought they may be a good match . i received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner . the next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off . i was upset and sewed them , and glued them . the following week the left slipper fell apart . i did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers , they were $ 29.00 . sooooooooooooooo disappointed . please forward to warmbat
0	these booties are very cute and soft , but they just slip right off my son 's feet . they do not have a way to secure the 'tongue ' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet , the 'tongue ' part just pulls right out . not a good value for the money .
0	this visor is square in shape instead of oval , i have never seen a square visor before . it looks very strange . also , it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be , it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head . i will not be wearing mine
1	i was n't expecting much based on the price , so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my order . the tote is a nice size , made of relatively heavy fabric and seems to be well-sewn . i 've paid a lot more for a lot less . this was a great buy
1	yes beautiful people i too own this shoe and it is fun and sexy . i did n't think at my age i could wear such a high wedge heel however , i was wrong and thankful to be so . this is a fun shoe which looks great on . i have it in the gold and i love wearing them out and about
0	i always buy the same size and type of overalls and this is the first time ordering this pair from dickies . they are very stiff and tight fitting . they should have actually been baggy on me , being the size that they were
0	this `` pillow '' is an inflated `` u '' that fits around your neck . one of the problems is , it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck . this can get pretty irritating the longer you use it . fortunately , it is dirt cheap , so then i guess you get what you pay for .
1	they are very nice and comfortable . i just advise ordering a size larger than you are used to
1	finally i have found a quality brand of swimsuit i can order on line and know it will fit . i 'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied . this particular style fit great when it arrived ; it arrived quickly within four days ; shipping was free ; and the lycra material is the most resilient i know given the chlorine bashing my suits get . please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores . thanks ! !
0	i bought these based on a previous review . after wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart . maybe the quality control person was out that day ? ? ? i returned them and got a full refund
1	i am not a runner ; thus , i use the shoes for typical tasks such as shopping , errands , hanging out , etc . i have owned many shoes over the years , and these are probably 1 of the 2 most comfortable shoes i have ever owned . i am hooked on the new balance line of running shoes .
0	these garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear .
0	the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that i did n't even try it on . it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that did n't go with the main color of the suit . very poor choice for a grab bag . taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company
1	this is a nifty small appropiate change purse for men or anyone actuall
0	i have ordered intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase . so far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings . i will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn . i now know why i pay $ 15.00 for two pair of jockey 's
1	my dh has worn clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned . this new pair of clarks , the citadel oxford , is his new favorite because it is light weight , casual , and so comfortable .
0	i was so disappointed in these . i am full-busted ( 38dd ) and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time . i used a band-aid and it did a better job . these provided no help at all . and they really hurt taking them off
0	poor product . no strap comes with this case . too difficult to get the ipod out for updates , whilst trying to pull out ipod can be dropped . front view cover is smeary and scratched . buttons are difficult to re-snap . no need for other voting on this -- just a poor product
0	i bought the wrong size , the bra was too big , but the straps dug into my shoulders -- that 's what was n't soft ... customer service returns was great though . ( essentials.com via amazon
1	the shirts are what i had asked for . they are sturdy and well made . i would buy more if i needed more . well worth the money spen
0	i just received this item and now i have to figure out how to return it . this clock is a piece of trash . i never could set it correctly . each time i set the time it would advance the day when going to the normal function mode . the setting button are not protected or disabled when the clock is closed . even it it worked properly it is very dificult to set . if you buy this clock you will regret it
1	i did n't want to pay over $ 50 for a sports bra , but i really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that . so i shelled out the dough for one and they were right ! it fits snug so there 's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob . i ordered a different sports bra from champion and this is by far my favorite of the two . the champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that 's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they 're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure . more positives : this one also fastens securely ( just start from the bottom and work your way up , it will fit ! ) and is super , super comfortable . i do wish the price were less so i could buy a second , but i 'll have to put that in my budget . nevertheless , as a wannabe runner with a large chest , it was worth the investment in comfort and security
1	these are without question , the best panties for wearing with slacks . no line at the leg , no line accross the middle of your behind , and no riding up . they are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant . sizing runs true to any other maidenform pantie you 've ever bought . can be had cheaper at a maidenform outlet store , but still well worth the price on amazon . buy lots of them
0	for all the costs involved in purchasing the jedi robe it was'nt worth it . shipping/handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item . i will never shop amazon or any online store
1	this is just the thing to put away for a christmas gift . nice product in a nice box , tied with a bow .
1	ditto ... i bought more of these . love the bibs with vinyl backings and absorbant terry fronts ... really stops the soakings that happen with little ones who are teething . i bought these for a very low price that could n't be beat . nice quality
1	got this for my dad - before his truck was a slew of mail and papers - worked out well
1	these shoes are awesome , i have bowled with them for the past couple of weeks and they are just what i was looking for . the color is hot and everyone on my league noticed them and said very positive things about them . thanks for the super fast shipping and supurb quailty
1	a great bargain ! saved 50 % over buying separately . good quality . very satified
1	it 's nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes . the only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins , so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured . however , for the price i would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart .
0	we ordered this pea coat from andrew christian . the coat- which is double-breasted- had no inside buttons . you have to have inside buttons to hold the coat evenly . i sent it back as defective . they were very immovable as to refunding shipping costs to me and then back to them- which amounted to $ 26.23 . they insisted that it was not defective . i called five other places that had pea coats and they all had inside buttons . not reliable and not good to work with .
1	i bought a couple of these bodysuits because i thought that they were quite amusing . the quality seems ok - i have not washed them yet so i ca n't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.the first thing i noticed was that the bodysuits are very long . they are not the stardard length you get with gerber and carter 's etc . the 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit . the chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small . in the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal . i have to wait until my son gets here to decide if i will convert the smaller ones into tees . this would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - hope this helps future buyers ! ! !
0	a good product and a good fit . wish the logo had been a little bigger
0	when this product was ordered it was to be a 9 1/2 wide when it was recieved it was a 9 1/2 medium . we live in south america and they were brought by some friends and now we have shoes that do n't fit in a different country
0	the ipod mini case self is very good from pacific design . but amazon made a mistake to choose ebags as their supplier . i have ordered one ipod and one ipod mini cases for my friend 's daughters as a christmas gift . the ipod case was shipped from amazon directly , as usual , it was nice packed and fast shipping . the other ipod mini was shipped from ebags . it was bad , bad and bad . i wo n't order anything from ebags any more . here is why : - it was almost one week later than amazon 's shipment . - it was an open , unpacked or returned item . - amazon charges the shipping for that item , even you qualify for the free shipping on your order . if you do n't care about all of these , please go ahead and good luck . i gave 2 stars is because of the product self , otherwise i would give none
1	no complaints . everything ran smoothly . i recommend this seller and this product to everyone . they are absolutely great , and they were exactly as described/pictured
0	even for $ 13 i expected some quality and got very little . the dye from the leather dyed my feet during a rain storm . the footpad was so rough it irritated the botton of my foot . the leather over the toe was so rough it irritated my toe . these were really poor
0	i realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3x is in trouble in the conservation of fabric , but this manutacturer must be very generous . the garment was so large i could have made two out of the one unit . this certainly was an error in sizing or i am smaller than i thought . i hesitate to purchase from this retailer because i can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle
1	i bought these for my granddaughter after i saw her wearing a pair of plain black rubber boots [ which she loved ] ! when i gave her these , she absolutely loved them ! they are so cute , with flowers and butterflies all over them.they run true to size , are well made , and look so bright and cheerful on a rainy day.needless to say , the black boots have been retired
1	this is a great swimsuit but if your buns are out of shape do n't buy since that is what is showing the most . i think it would rate a 5 if it was n't lined like previous speedos
0	these were a waste of money . they were not properly designed to cover anything , much less my backside , even though i did order what should have been the right size . i realize i have a lot to cover , but i ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick . i 've still got a pair in white that i have n't even opened ! and wo n't ! it would be a waste of energy !
0	thin cloth ... aweful insulation factor , , , ,does not look good on me..
0	you have sent me a model different from for the one that i asked ! ! ! ! i live in chile ... .. there is no way of returning it ... ...
1	excellent product for the price a lot cheaper than the bridal shop fast shipping thank
0	tan color looks very synthetic , cheapens look of shoe . also very wide fitting
0	i did n't like this item very much because it seems to have terrible quality . it already came with a loose thread . but it fits good .
0	only the front of the bag is actually beaded , and the quality poor . the original price should have been $ 5 or fewer , to be reasonable . this would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory
0	ordered the wand for x-mas and took it with us on vacation . when santa came to the carribean the wand did not work . no light , no sound and cheap plastic that did not thrill anybody .
1	i bought this item for my boyfriend for his tailgaiting experience this year since he has season tickets . he loves everything about it - especially the fact that it is the bears ! =
0	i too have been searching for the panty in the picture . i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg . there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric , but there is more like 3 inches ... yuk ! ; b has anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured ? ( the ones that we all seem to love and want ) ? please email me personally if u have found them ! sheemna @ yahoo.co
0	very nice prints , but the quality of the briefs is not good . to top it , one of the briefs was even damaged . i guess the maker does n't have a quality control department . overall , a bad buy .
1	this sweater fits perfect - exactly what i was looking for and i coud n't go wrong with this fabulous price . my husband liked it as well
0	the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it . fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box . i tried it on just to see if i 'd like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition , and it was not cute on . i immediately returned it
0	the main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order . amazon had said they would rectify the error , although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle-buckle , and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties , and a different strap entirely
1	turf gear is initally marketed for use with football players , well i think the year bill clinton became president was the last time i donned shoulder pads , but it did n't stop me from being active later in life . with long sleeve turf gear shirts from under armour , i was hoping that the product would live up to the description . a long sleeve shirt that is skin tight , yet allows your skin to breath ? material that wicks sweat away from the skin ? sounded almost too good to be true , but i took a chance anyways . so far i 've used mine both hiking and cycling , with the latter getting so much use that i need to order more . despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on , it stretches and breathes amazingly well . i was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used amazon 's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the under armour product ( fogdog ) and ended up just fine . works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what i use mine for . bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well , and is very comfortable . i must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling , these shirts are amazingly durable ! i feel the price is definitely worth it , excuse me while i go order more
1	this is , by far , the most comfortable pair of unders i 've ever worn . over the years , i 've gone with boxers and with briefs , and in the boxers vs. briefs contest , both are losers compared to the contour thong . there 's no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support . the contour thong has a y thong back , and you do n't need to have the body of an international male/undergear model to wear these . for any guy with an open mind , i recommend these -- just buy one or two pairs and give a try
1	these sandals are very nice and the price that i paid was a very good price
0	the corset looks so pretty ... its a pretty material ... it can hold you yes ... it has a boning made of some crappy material ... after wearing it i noticed something was poking me ... both ends the top and the bottom ... well when i take a look it looks like the type of thing guys use to fish line . it hurted so bad ... so i tried to `` snip '' it with some nail clippers.. they just keep on coming and coming ... it totally sucks.. now i cant even use it without thinking of a painful experience
1	the glasses were in excellent condition , they were exactly what i expected plus more ( they sent them in a glasses case which was a bonus to me . this was an excellent seller
0	i have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990 ; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter , spring and fall . each boot used top quality leather and vibram soles . i actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot . both pairs were very comfortable and durable , with a look all to their own . my third pair , which was recently purchased , were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots . the leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as i began to snug up the laces . the backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory . not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots , i sent them back . i did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs . made in portugal to made in china ... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in rockport .
0	suit was too small , not enough information available on the site for it . i called amazon , but even the customer representative was not sure the size . i bought the suit as he suggested , but it is too small
0	they are very shiney and but not very comfortable at all and the arch is funn
0	this shoe is extrememly uncomfortable ! ! the straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail . i wo n't ever wear them again
1	my husband liked his slippers i got him for christmas . he said that they were warm and soft
0	this my first pair of 100 % nylon socks . the problem i have is that my feet can not breathe in them . my socks are wet after a full day wearing them . i guess i 'll just have to stay with cotton ... i 've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks . they do stay up above my calf all day long , though .
1	although i prefer jockey , these hanes bikini briefs are great and i plan to order more . great value . i also bought fruit of the loom but in my opinion the hanes have a much nicer fuller cut , the fruit of the loom are for youngsters with tiny butts . the reason i did n't buy jockey is they 're too expensive
0	as much as seller might like this backpack to be 11 '' by 8.5 '' by 6.5 '' , the one i 've got is surely not that big ( 10 '' x8 '' x4 '' at best ! ) , and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it ( and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise , was it what they were aiming for ? ) . the material is ok , so is the craftsmanship , but the fact that they lied ( yes ! l-i-e-d ! ) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal . a great dissapointment ! ! ! :
1	they were a nice quality , nicely priced , and were shipped promptly . i would buy this brand again
1	the item was what i expected however , it took them weeks to have the item shipped . i sent over emails to follow up and they never responded . bad customer service .
1	i have worn nothing but levi 's for over 20 years now , and i have been through almost every style of them . these are still the same great jeans , reliable fit and quality that you know . currently i have three of these in my closet nest to standard 505 's , and they are virtually identical , but the signiture series cost a lot less . same thick denim material , unlike a lot of fancy boutique jeans , that last a long time , and can stand up to most activities that an active person does . check these out , you wo n't be dissapointed , and neither will your wallet
0	they are warm and comfortable while they last . all of the sheep skin inside has fallen out , there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper . the outside of the slipper still looks like new . it is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months
1	i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip ( along with the 20 '' nxt roller ) and i 'm very happy with it . the styling and fit is excellent , and it holds more than i expected . it 's comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder . i purchased the black version . with victorinox 's lifetime guarantee you ca n't go wrong ! amazon.com is very competitive on price on this bag , and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them
0	this item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . i ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . i gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly
1	birkenstock clogs are the comfiest shoes . during a recent trip to washington dc , i was the only person in my group whose feet did n't hurt after several hours of walking . i have had several pairs over the years . they last forever and go with tons of different outfits
1	these sweaters are a fantastic value for $ 18 . quality is excellent , though the colored trim may not appeal to all tastes . note that the fabric is somewhat thicker than most merino wool sweaters and the sizing on this model is a little snugger than the other raffi merino sweaters
0	i guess that i can not properly review this item , i never received it . this is the second time that i ordered from this same company , anderson christian , with almost the same results . the company billed my credit card upon ordering , and then sent one e-mail saying that the items that i ordered are on back order . i eventually cancelled the order . due to the fact that i live overseas at the moment , i order a lot of things online . i will not be ordering from this company again .
1	i was having a hard time finding a cheaper swim suit so i just ordered one from the grab bag . i figured nothing could be worse than my plain black swim suit . also the swim suit was delivered in half the time that it was expected
0	i ordered 5 of these belt buckles . the company sent the wrong items 2 times before finally admitting they did n't actually have this belt . i needed the belts for a deadline and if they had told me the first time that it was n't in stock i could have ordered it elsewhere
1	these are just what i was looking for in a knee sock.. perfect weight and never slip but are n't too tight at the top either
1	i just want to make something clear ... the windbreaker is not prada , the tag reads miu miu , a very good brand , but definetely not prada . i found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket . i layered it with a black yohi yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect ...
1	this is truly a beautiful bag ! i got the classic dark leather , which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures . the leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag 's character . the leather is thicker than i expected ; while it is by no means stiff , it is not ultra-soft , ultra-thin butter leather . this is leather that will age well and last for many , many years . the zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather , they 'll be durable . ( the other hardware is the same type of matte/antiqued silver . ) the bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap . the cotton strap not only adds to the bag 's uniqueness , it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over . ( i wear it across my chest like a messenger bag . ) inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag . one is gusseted and works well for a cell phone ( or items of a similar size ) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards ; i would have really liked for my ipod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick wo n't fit . the internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook , file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags i 've tried because they were sized for laptops . i actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book . on the outside , each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it . this creates 2 tall , thin pockets where i keep pens ; it would have been nice if one side did n't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items , but that 's not a problem for me . the entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket . on the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag . the magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong . there are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you do n't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag . i 've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments . though the bag is pricey , it is obviously crafted with care from high-quality materials . it also has a very distinctive look . i am very happy with this purchase and have already added another diongini bag to my amazon wish list
0	i got this bra thinking it would be great for rigorous sports and my 38ddd chest . think again . go for the the enell sports bra . i bought a size 3 and it is perfect . no bounce whatsoever ! ! ! i was amazed ... . do n't bother with this one
1	the product is in good condition when it was shipped . the quality is good . thank you .
0	i love the t-shirt because i loved the movie , but just note that if you are typically bothered by restrictive neck lines and arms , this may present an issue for you . the areas you see in the navy color have a tapering fit
0	cute designs but they shrink . i have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when i attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up .
0	although merchandise arrived quicker than promised , and the color was perfect , the socks did n't even last through one baseball game ... ... ... lousy product ! !
0	i never wear this top after having purchased it . the stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them . the shirt itself hangs very awkwardly . i prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and , therefore , is n't very flattering . i think i 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon . generally , i have been pleased with adidas products , but this shirt did not work for me personally .
0	i almost fell for it ... then i realized , how in the world are those pearls so cheap ? ? they are n't real ! if you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it . it would be helpful if the item was advertised as `` imitation pearl thong . ''
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
1	i have owned and worn this for several months now , and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing , as i am a medium sized person ( 10-12 ) and it does seem to be a little large , yet i wear it anyways . hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size
0	you get what you pay for , i guess , but i really do n't like these boots . they look fine , and the construction ( appearance ) seems sound ; however they are not comfortable . i have had several pairs of skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable ( at least nearly so ) . yet the right boot 's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly , as i can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them . it feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes . my foot also seems to pronate markedly . the left boot does n't seem to suffer from the same defect . they also have very `` hard '' cushioning ... i ca n't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots . also i 've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets . i should probably return them as defective , but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive
1	the product arrives just as shown . sturdy , attractive leather . just the right size for small items . this is an a++ product
0	i bought a green ipod scok , thinking the it would be that same as the picture they show at the top of the page , but it ended up having a lighter green than what they showed and what i wanted .
1	i find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes .
0	it looks great but the lace in the back itches so bad that i can not wear it
0	same as the capezio jazz shoes , way to small for normal people . none of the kids ( 48 ) could fit into the shoes , in the sizes that where recommended . all had to go up at least 2-3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides . very frustrating . makes me want to start my own dance shoe business-not for profit .
0	sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe . this case is a classic - you get what you pay for . cheap price for a cheap shoe . 1 ) this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe . 2 ) no arch support whatsoever . the rubber is almost too thick . 3 ) i have serious doubths that this is a leather shoe . feels like cheap vinyl at best . 3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute . this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking . this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my # 14 pair
0	i usually wear size 7m . however , this shoe of size 7m is way too small . i have to return it to amazon and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself . i will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear
0	perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely , or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description . the fact is , i thought that i would be receiving 84 plastic stays ( 3x28 ) , 28 each in 3 different sizes . at $ 8.00 , that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays . what i got , and i confess that the product description could be interpreted this way , was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes . when you add in the $ 4.00 i was charged for shipping ( actual us postal service postage on the package was $ 1.84 ) , this really is a poor deal compared to other available options . about 43 cents for each plastic collar stay ? a bad choice
0	i purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable . i ca n't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they wo n't stay in my ears long enough to decide . even when i 'm sitting still on the sofa , they fall out ... none of the sizes work for me ! ! ! if falling out of my ear is n't bad enough , the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds . very disappointed !
0	i do n't know why but it is an ugly dress . it does n't look like the pic . maybe it 's my shape ( i have wide angular , shoulders ) but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny-like
0	this bra was a terrible waste of money . the wire on one side stabs me constantly . the other side is fine . it 's obviously defective .
1	stylish and comfy ... what more could you ask for ? my husband was very pleased
1	russell ! i really would n't buy any other kind . too bad they do n't make concert t-shirts ! great material , long-lasting . the best
1	these socks are just what i was looking for , a thin cotton blend to wear running . no bunching and they breath very well . the price and timliness of the order was also great
1	this is a quality sweatshirt that i am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather . i have had trouble , in the past , with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product . the only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem . the service was excellent and i will return for more bears gear
0	i have these in black , and while i find them to go with just about every outfit i wear to work , i wish they were just a little ( read : quite a lot ) less uncomfortable . firstly , the insole provided does n't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly . almost like it 's too wide . my foot is neither narrow nor wide , so this is n't something i typically notice about a shoe . there is an arch , but because of the weirdly shaped insole it does n't provide any support . the zig zap strap is a really cute feature that i love , but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe . you can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside , but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints . if you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable . all in all , a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort
1	the slippers are great ! they do seem to be on the large side of a 15 . my husband had to put paper in the toes . he wears 15 in every thing else
0	cheap ! but still useable . inside had a stained piece of paper/cardboard ? ... flimsy leather . not recommended
0	this jacket is wind and water resistant , but not waterproof . i was soked through after first rain . i use it mainly for wind block while biking now
0	they were very cheaply made , thank goodness they were just for little girls , i would have been embarrassed if i 'd have ordered them for a gift for someone.i know i should n't expect alot for $ 5. , but i 'd have thought they 'd be better than they were
0	like a permanent wedgie , these kept riding up my crack . i do n't recommend these at all ... the liquid metallic look is only useful if you 're going to be a male stripper . otherwise , you 've got liquid metal up your crack ... not very appealing
1	this product is fine , however it was much too baggy . i 'm not that skinny and i felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous . there is nothing wrong with the short , but i just wish i had bought a smaller size . definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product .
1	this is such a wonderful pair of gloves . they are light and easily portable . they can be folded and stored in one 's pockets . they have features that enable use of one 's index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs . the synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather ( especially wind and rain ) . i am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone 's elses
0	i purchased 5 of the anvil ss henleys in assorted colors not long ago . out of the box , they were good quality . after 2 washes , however , they have shrunk drastically to the point that they can not be tucked in anymore . my personal opinion ... waste of money
0	very , very , weird fit . too short , too wide , tiny ankles , very big and loose above ankle
1	i own 2 pairs ... they are classy and go with everything , but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy ... but you eventually get the hang of it
1	i bought these just a couple of months ago but i 've already put them to the test . i went hiking to a waterfall in mexico , i ended up covered in mud , my new shoes included . i was worried they would be spoiled ( it really was a lot of mud ) . then i just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone . besides being really comfortable , it 's great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job .
0	ordered large , got `` youth large '' , too small . threw out receipt before checking . my bad . wife now wears t-shirt to work out in
0	for slip on slippers-no hands required-these do not pass the test . the small lip in the back does more harm than good.i ordered 1/2 size large and it was not enough . if you have high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere . the synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable
0	i agree with the other review . i love the tag-free feeling , but that was about all i liked about this bra . the fabric seems really cheap . after maybe 6 washings , my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy , and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill . for what they charge for even basic bras these days , i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric .
1	there so warm and cozy for those long winter nights and they 're good for mountian hikers . the keep your feet warm and dry
0	returns and exchanges are very slow - process has taken a month so far
0	quality was terrible , undersized or seconds . later i saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1/3 of this price . i would not recommend these to anyone i paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit . amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere . it is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface . i am disgusted with this product
1	my son used these socks as part of his football uniform . he said they were comfortable and i was happy that they withstood the abuse week after week . the did n't run or snag like some other lighter weight socks
1	i bought these because i normally ca n't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert . these are great . very comfortable . i plan on living in them this summer . i bought a size 8 croc which was fine . these were on the big size so i exchanged them for the next smaller size . i guess i am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes , go smaller with the athens croc
1	this is a great pair of shoes and a good to have n your collection.it is a subtle silver and looks absolutely delicate on your feet.but it is one size smaller than normal.i usually wear a 8.5m and this turned out to be small for me.i do fit into it but my toe juts out a little bit.a 9m would have been better.but i dont have the patience to return it , so i am gon na keep it.its a lovely pair of shoes
0	i thought the case was nice looking , but when actually using it , i was very dissapointed . the case is not secure at all , it keeps sliding off . if you have the little clip on ipod shuffle , i do not recommend the aluminum case
1	i ordered this for my son for his birthday.they told me it was backordered i was so afraid he wouldnt have it for his birthday.i sent them a email and they answered right away , i emailed them one day and had the present 2 days later.even through this is a small company they took care of a long time customer now
0	i do like this t-shirt . i liked the organic cotton and the general style . but i will never buy american apparel again . not only are they very labor and union unfriendly , their ads exploitive of young girls ( i mean , i can tolerate some of the young models in general , but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations ) , but a friend 's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores . i know i can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere . ick
0	it took a week and two days for my pants to arrive , i bought another item from amazon the same day and it arrived in three days . my experience with this company 's shipping was n't good
0	i found these shoes by searching the women 's option for running shoes . the name may say unisex , but there is no indication that the sizing is 100 % male . not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size . when the shoes arrived here , they were huge . i tried to return them , but amazon considers this to be my fault , and planned to charge back any shipping , promotions and coupons against a possible refund . i had done very well using a coupon , a sale , a `` buy $ 80 worth of shoes and get $ 20 off instantly '' promotion and amazon prime , so my `` refund '' would be less than nothing . that 's right -- if i return the shoes , i owe money . because amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women 's section of the site might be men 's shoes instead . yeah , that seems fair
1	these are hot , hot , hot ! will be buying them in other colors . my guy went nuts
1	i liked the book it was good but not as i expected , i needed more explanation before buying the book , like how the book will look like from the inside , anyhow in general its good thank you amazo
1	i have to tell anyone , who has lower back or foot pain , to try a pair of merrells . when you try them on , they feel comfortable , but once you wear them for a week , you 'll never wear another brand of footwear ( unless you have to ) . most of their shoes need no `` break in '' time . i own these in four different colors . my eldest daughter owns two pairs of these . i own more than 20 pairs of merrells , i have been wearing these for years . the cool thing about them is , when you see someone else wearing a pair , it 's like you 're both in on a secret . you know , you 're walking in heaven
1	great leggings ... .i love the feel of these ... .thicker than the regular cotton/lycra leggings and they hold you in nicely ... ..one thing i like about danskin is the waist elastic is not tight , it just rests on your waist . it 's extremely comfortable . gusseted cotton crotch is also a plus ... i wear these to yoga , pilates , on hikes with my dog and just about everywhere else . oh , and they look much more expensive than the cotton leggings ... ... i even wear them in 90 degree weather . i just ca n't get enough of them ... ... i have always appreciated danskin quality , just machine wash and dry and off you go ... .
1	the new balance 991 gl ( and 991 and 990 before it ) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use ( even some cross training ) . i have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support , wear well and are well ventilated . the 991 gl carries on that tradition . hopefully , the 992 will be just as good
0	our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up . he could not wait to get this belt . we had purchased the police uniform earlier . the first time i ordered the belt , it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it . when it finally arrived , he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long . it is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it . it is less than 4 weeks old and probably wo n't make it through the rest of the month
1	i 've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and i 've tried a lot of different nursing bras . i got this one several months ago and absolutely love it . i 've been reasonably happy with the bravado line in general -- they hold up very , very well , stay comfortable , and remain supportive over time -- but i just was n't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one . i am often between bra sizes ( between 34 and 36 , between b and c cups , depending on the maker ) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left , often have one breast larger than the other . the 36c fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching , lines , or that nasty `` spillover '' when it 's been too long between feedings . i wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it 's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly . the only other nursing bra that i 've found that works as well under t-shirts is a mimi brand one that it costs just about as much , but does n't hold its shape for very long . basically , this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last
1	these boots are a little bit on the snowboarder side of things as far as the way they look . the fit is right on and they are very warm and dry . i love them ! they are very easy to just pull on and tuck your jeans into . highly recommended
1	these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look . they also are easy on the feet . i like the suede versions best personally , but when winter hits its best to have the leather
1	this product is great . their are a ton of different ways to use this bag . from rolling it to carrying it like a backpack . i would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other . it is great .
1	... these are comfortable . you can actually forget you 're wearing them . and if you are like me and worn just about every thong there is , that is huge . i was thinking i should just stop wearing thongs at all until i found these . i 've washed my pair a couple times in the regular cycle and dried them , and it still is holding up well . i 'm back on amazon.com to buy more . go for it girls , you wo n't regret it ! sexy and comfy . could you ask for more ... i now own three pairs
1	i purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of ugg-like boots . we looked in stores and other online shoe sites for uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season , could n't find her size . we saw these on amazon in her size and thought we 'd try them out . they were definitely worth it ! they are just as warm and comfortable as uggs and since the price was so good , we were able to buy two pairs . they are nicely made , comfortable , and attractive . she 's wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable . she is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots
1	i just purchased fleece hoodies and pants by andrew christian , the material is wonderful . the hoody feels luxuriously soft on my skin . i would recommend them highly . the pansts are low-rise , since i am older , i am still getting used to that , but they too feel really good on .
1	everything you need that your ipod did n't come with , at one low price . shipped promptly
0	found the item to be poorly designed . did not fit my checks or recorder . item is useless unless you use checks with side tear
1	this is the best style and fit of underwear that i have ever owned . i have been buying this style for almost 7 years now . it gives me the support and freedom that i need in physical activity and the comfort i desire in everyday wear . plus , it provides you with a nice lift and profile . note , beware ordering through freshpair . my order took 1 month from them
0	the stockings were not in the package , and there is no good way to get in touch with the company that sold me outfit in the first place . my girlfriend was disappointed and i felt like a fool when no one even took the time to return my call . i will not do business with this company again
0	these slippers are anything but comfortable . besides the sizing being to small , i felt like i was putting my foot into a kid 's slipper . the width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone 's foot , and the inside material is also anything but comfortable .
1	for the money , these are a great value . unlike a comment above , i have not found these short at all , but average in length
1	i purchased these boots for my daughter . i bought two pairs for her younger sister and she fell in love with the look . she tried them on at a local sporting store and just loved how they hugged and felt on her feet . i would buy all colors of the rainbow if she asked
1	i had the opportunity of wearing these for my husband before i left for the west coast and my annual visit with my friends and our second annual lingerie party . my hubby could n't believe i 'd wear something like this , but boy oh boy , he did n't object . he could n't take his eyes off my , well you can just imagine what it was he could n't take his eyes off of
0	very disappointing ! i ordered stretch jeans . i paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not stretch jeans . i called cust . service . he spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he ( bealls cust.serv . ) sent me another pair i would get the same thing . in order to get money back i had to return the item . now i 've paid postage again ! and yes i did receive the $ 12.99 credit for the jeans , but what about the postage ? this was not my fault ! the item was incorrect ! ! your return policy indicates that yo uwill pay the postage , so if you need to see a copy ( which i also put in the return box ) of what i ordered , please feel free to contact me . i printed it out so i can fax it , scan it email it , or snail mail it , or however you would like to receive it . please return the shipping costs that i paid for a product that apparently mismarked . thanks , debbie pearson p.s . i see the title description has been corrected to show that these are not stretch jeans -- wish i would have known so that i would not have to be writing this review . if no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon , but especially not bealls
0	who would ever wear this monstracity ? first of all you got no color , no padding , no pazazz ! this shirt makes the garbage bag i wear look like a royal tunic . it is also from a company called jerzees and it 's not a jersey ? what up with that ? michael jordan is probably spinning in his grave
0	this review is n't really about the flip-flops , because theyre great . why would you buy them here for $ 5.61 when you can get them at the store for $ 2.50 each ?
1	very comfortable and durable . i would wear these outside - although not for a long walk , but the sole is durable enough for walking to the mailbox or taking the dog for a brief jaunt . i recommend these if you are looking for an inexpensive and durable slipper
1	i love this guess oval tag necklace . it is just like the tiffany 's oval tag necklace , and it has an adorable little rhinestone dangle . the best part is the price . i only had to spend $ 18.00 for it , and there is also a matching bracelet for only $ 15.00 ! i would recommend this to anyone of any age
1	these shoes are durable , comfortable , and most importantly come in different widths . most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently do n't make anything but d width . new balance does . for those of you complaining about width , my guess is that if you size your feet correctly , that problem will go away . i had always worn a 12d width , until some gentleman at a mom and pop store sized my feet correctly for the first time in my life i found out i need a 13b . you may think you know your feet , but you may not . as to comfort , i ca n't complain . as to durability , maybe they are a little stiffer , but if that is what extends the life of these shoes over the others , that is well worth it in my book
0	i was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots , but it did n't last long . not even 3 weeks after i bought it , it already has deteriorated . given that i live in seattle , rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking . it was like wearing melted cardboard
0	these are supposed to 3x boxers , that means they should be made for a big man . well they fit my boyfriend like little boy boxers . they were about 2 inches long . they were horrible for him . he threw 2 of them out . my advice : dont get these for a big , tal man they 'll mmake u feel like a giant
1	this is very comfy and pretty and a great price . try it you will be sold . i am glad i did
0	i wore the boots one time and it will be the only time . the boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable . the material is so hard and did not give . i even wore socks and that did not help . i would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort
1	my son loves the shoes . they are comfortable and very stylish . they do not show dirt like other shoes . they look to be made well and designed very nice too
1	pros : ultra fast delivery w/package tracking . item was shipped within a few hours of order . suit is in great condition and i like the color . cons : when they say grab bag ... that means the suit may or may not look like the picture . mine turned out to be a blue stripped jammer ... which is cool with me cause i actually wanted a blue jammer . just be prepared
0	i did n't purchase this shoe . i ordered two pairs of another dr. scholl 's that day.you must have an error in the records
1	the overall quality of the garment is excellent . the fabric is of very good quality , as is the stitching . the sizing is also accurate . however , the tank top i received was not the one i had ordered , but a substitute ! thus , four stars , not 5 . in the future i will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable
0	the mid-size is actually quite large . had i to do it over again , i would just get the original size because that would be sufficient . i like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes ! i found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled , it stayed on very well . that was a concern that i had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents . i did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors . the visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering . i chose purple and it is a beautiful shade . the bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors .
0	this was something that i could of bought at the flea market for 20 bucks and it cost me $ 60 with shippng . the leather is cheap , it is so thin that they lined it with batting to make it feel thicker . buyer beware . would not buy again . bottom grade leather :
0	get ee if you get these . the d is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable
0	the other day i excitedly tried this bra on at walmart . i could n't believe i could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store . unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims . depending on the company i am a 38 dd or 34ff . i tried this bra on in a 38 dd . i was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support . basically under a shirt i sagged as if i was wearing no bra at all . that is not the effect i want when i go strapless . only goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety
0	i loved the concept of this item , but it did n't live up to my expectations . the top was extremely loose in the bra portion and provided no support . the pants , however , were comfortable and i really loved them . the top needs to be reworked
1	i like bike swimmer jocks . i think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you . this is all you need to keep you in place . they do n't cover any more than they need to . they 're all you need when you jog ( i do n't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore ) . the swimmer jock style in general is like that , regardless of the manufacturer . however , i 'm giving it a 4 because i prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon , polyester , and coolmax . they are much softer and can whick better . plus , there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors , such as ones by calvin klein and baskit . why not add to your fun when you jog ?
1	these keep your feet warm and toastie . will want more when these wear out
1	this was a very nice item . i bought it for my mom for christmas . she loved it . it was shipped very fast and i was informed very well on shipment information . this shoe was a great deal . usually they are pretty expensive but they had a great deal . thanks !
0	i ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team 's competition , but i only received 12 in the mail . the packing slip said 16 and i was charged for the 16 . it was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores . would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time .
0	i was mislead by the advertisement . the shorts are skin thin and do n't have pockets in them . quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts . maybe it is my problem 'cause i am not a native english language speaker , maybe not
1	this is a form fitting , but not to snug nightshirt . gives freedom of movement , yet also allows some comfort with a nice breathable material . deffinitly will order more of thes
1	i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week
0	looks great on the web , do n't think many would buy it if they could examine it in-person . shame , colors and style are excellent just let down in quality and fit
1	great service . the shoes were just what i wanted . i highly recommend these walking shoes because they are light weight and comfortable
1	it 's a very nice polo , very soft and nice to a casual date
0	i purchased a bag from this vendor , thinking that by being affiliated with amazon that they were legit . i got the bag and thought it looked fake . the vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique . the boutique confirmed that it was not authentic , so i am returning the bag i got from moda party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney , unauthentic bag
0	well i am a big sunglass fan . i just love them so i was excited to get these . they seemed very cute . well when i got them the lenses were scratched and there was stuff on the sides of the glasses . this was my first purchase from this seller and honestly i dont think i will ever buy from them again
0	when you buy natori you expect the best . but this product just is n't up to their usual high standard . most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings . for 20 dollars they should be awesome . they are n't . my favorite panty right now is a nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks . i have n't seen them online , but this is worth a trip to the store
1	i love it . it is just what i wanted . great deal and smooth transaction . thanks
1	i love the shoes , they 're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what i like . they 're a beautiful color , something you do n't always see , and quite eye-catching . and they just so happened to go very well with a suit i purchased months ago . as a `` nine west '' fantatic , thank you amazon for having them available !
0	the item was not as pictured . it is funky and of poor quality . the seller did not respond when i contacted him about this
0	i purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift , but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store , and it 's not even worth the dollar . very cheezy item .
1	my girlfriend thinks they 're sexy and they 're solid underwear . no swampiness from boxers or boxer briefs . if you 're a briefs guys ( i switch around ) , these are the way to go
1	what a great pair of pajamas these are . so soft , non-binding , roomy , and great for lounging . i 've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays . very good quality silk , well sewn and tailored . i 'm normally an xl tall but the regular xl fit fine
1	on time delivery - would have been nice to have a gift wrap optio
1	i own this halter top in black white . the colors are vibrant the fabric quality is very good . this style runs small , so order 1 size up for a comfy fit . this company 's customer service rocks
1	great little case we have two . i like the inside pocket for extra memory/battery .
1	quality product , exactly what i wanted , but it runs large . i wear a half size , bought the size larger now think i 'll buy the smaller size
1	this shoe transcended all my expectations ... the style , color , and fit were all everything i hoped for and more ! ! ! all this plus a modest price ! !
0	the vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors , and make it so i can not wear them at work . i love rockports in general , and these are comfortable and well made as expected , but they leave a trail of scuff marks
1	i received these slippers for christmas in december 2005 . i got the pine green , a very nice looking slipper with lots of comfort . i am ordering another pair in charcoal , as i want 2 pairs to have at both places i live . it 's all about comfort for me when i am home , so these fit the bill . good value as well
0	these shoes look great but are horrible running shoes . the soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact . i do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes . they may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them . i returned them and plan to try something else
0	these tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini . however , as another reviewer noted , there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin . i 'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that i own are for my size , medium 32-34 . streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam , but i 've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this . maybe buying the next size up would work , but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and i like keeping 'em close to home .
0	this product never made it to destination . it was purchased with pants to match ( which were pin-striped and did n't ) and it was never sent to the recipient , nor was i invoiced , so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point , or even if they intend to send the correct pants ? ? ? all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday , and the wrong products otherwise , i will not purchase from this seller again
1	before seeing it with my own eyes , i was a little skeptical of the huge buttons . after wearing it , i felt they were hardly noticable . i bought the brown version for $ 17.99 and i thought it was well worth it . this jacket is surprisingly wind resistant , ideal for cold weathers . the pockets on either side are so huge that you can practically store a couple of cell phones in there
1	this mask attached using some velcro in the rear . i love it because it can be removed or put on without taking off my helmet ! at first i had some problems with my glasses fogging up , what i did was just pull it extra tight until the material was very snug with my cheeks . this drastically reduced fogging . i read on another products review that using some medical tape below the eyes would eliminate fogging ( on a similar product ) overall this has been a great buy . nic
0	very nice feeling robe and fit well . although i only had it 3 weeks and one washing and the seams on the lapel started coming undone . my wife is now making me one instead
0	i love the cotton color , just the right shade for most beige and some white slacks . the show style it the most unconfortable of any clark shoe i have have . there is something strange about the left shoe , it give me a blister everytime i wear it
0	i bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately , interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts . i usually lift weights , have no prior injuries , and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form ( i played a college sport , etc. ) . after a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that i could barely move them regularly . it was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier ( free weights included ) . perhaps i was doing the exercises incorrectly , but that seems like a real risk with a video like this .
1	this is absolutely the most comfortable and flattering bra i have even owned . have thrown out all my regular bras and only wear this one now . the fit is unbelievable
0	this item was cancelled by amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order.very poor customer servic
0	the shirt was beautiful . notice i used the past tense verb `` was '' ? after hand washing it twice the hem came out , the front tie fell off , and the side of the lace ripped open . it found a new home in the trash .
0	seller will not honor prices listed ... then if you leave seller negative feedaback..amazon will remove it ! ! ! do not trust seller ratings..they are false ! ! ! !
1	these boots are warm and comfortable , like my sheepskin slippers . my feet are toasty , even when it 's freezing outside . they have a thicker sole than some other styles , which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice . i love the warm brown of the chestnut . they look great ! at 50 % off , the price was great , too
1	i love these running shoes . they have a great look and they feel great , too . they fit my feet perfectly
1	service was very quick , and they were having a free shipping special , so it was very well priced
0	`` i am an honest seller and i insure 100 % satisfaction to my customers . i can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you . please withdraw the feedback : '' -jtf trading do n't bother . i bought a better product from oldglory . the feedback stays . people should know what they are buying . -me `` not a problem . 1 feedback does n't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service . '' -jtf trading well , i guess all i can do is you `` other customers '' know what a pos this hat was . that , and i had the hassle of this guy emailing me after i thought i made it clear that the matter was closed . try oldglory for a better deal and a better product
0	if you are a weightlifter or bodybuilder , the yoke piping will cut into your lats and pecs unless you buy a larger size than usual . this restrictive band makes the jacket rather uncomfortable . the velcro is n't quite right either . the material itself is nice to the touch , but the design is flawed ... was n't worth even the sale price .
0	nice stretchy material but too short and i 'm usually a 16-18 . the g-string is not even close to plus size ... do n't even bother
0	these would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order . i emailed western chief for a size chart . i then ordered my son 's boots according to the size chart western chief sent me . once i received the boots i was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child 's boot . i then called western chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so i could order the correct boots . i spoke with a ms . brewer , who was rather rude , she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back . of course that was a week ago . i luckily found very similar boots at target - problem solved . how could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong ? the bad customer service was just the cherry on top :
0	i bought these shoes on a whim from amazon , and was very disappointed and returned them . i normally wear size 10m from adidas , as i do with my metrum shoes and superstar iis . yet with these shoes , size 10m is way too small , and quite painful . they were returned ... if you order them , make sure you get a larger/wider size
1	we ordered this case for our son 's creative player , and it 's a hit . it fits snuggly , he can access all the functions with no problems , and the loup allows him to attach it to a variety of cords and `` leashes '' during different activities . a great value for the money !
0	i broke and chipped most of my short fingernails trying to unlock where the keys are suppose to go . once i got the keys on the holders the zipper broke . i threw it away , but had to scape up my nails again to get my keys off the holders
0	i thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase . when i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made . throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag , which was in my pocket . i then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed .
0	these bras do not hold up very well . i started wearing them in june after the birth of my son and i have already had to throw both of them away - six months later
0	i was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be . i mean , at almost $ 25 invested included shipping , i was expecting better quality . well , it 's very thin , made in china , and has plastic snaps . the so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that 's generated . i 've owned many ponchos through the years , and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period . the reason involves the way it 's cut . what i 've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind does n't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside . next , you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time . so , a good lining , or a breathable system is required . if you 're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain , then you can get a cheap $ 10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere . however , if you camp a lot , or will be out in the elements , you need better . the best poncho i ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner . this solves both of the problems i mentioned , because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat
1	i love these shoes . i bought 3 colors and they are great ! they are very stylish and comfortable and that is hard to find in a dress shoe
0	this item is not 100 % cotton . rather , it is 100 % polyester
0	the material 's good , but the suit runs way too small . i ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements , but all my wobbly bits are poking out . i do n't think i could wear this out in public ! not for curvy women !
0	i recieved this item yesterday . initaly i was very happy , it changed my 8gb black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it . the inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through , i would have preferred an opaque white , but it did not look terribly bad with the green , though blue , red , or any other color than green would have been better with the black i had not the inital foresight to picture this . i was still pretty happy at this point . the hip-clip was removed right away , i have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my logitech mm50 ( portable speaker ) without taking it out of the case , eureka , this case did that , without the clip of course . the lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today i discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the ipod nano , so that i would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost . well , i was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off . unitl , i discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case . now , despite the fact that this is the `` aluminum '' iskin duo , this was not the case at all . the green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look . okay that was still acceptable , until , i discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off , sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away . that was it , that was the broke back camel inducement , and now i am the proud owner of a case that i will never be happy with . at first i had been all excited , and was considering the purchase of other colors , not now , this in my consideration was a waste of money . hopefully i 'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done . sincerly ro
0	sadly , this well designed item does n't work for me . it comes detached from its clip while i 'm exercising and plunges to the floor dragging my headphones off
1	i got this jacket last week , i liked it for the price i paid
0	i had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while i type -- they keep the office i work at at very cold temperatures . these gloves seeemed perfect -- because many fingerless gloves- do n't have fingerless thumbs -- but these gloves do . the cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves . i ordered the black pair . well , the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers -- they snag easily . they are warm and i would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily . but i did only pay 2.99 for them so i guess it 's a case of you get what you pay for .
1	i ordered 2 for gifts and 1 for myself based on other reviews . i was not disappointed ! the bag is large and roomy , made of heavy-duty material , with outside pocket , and has a neat little clasp to hook your keys , etc . for easy finding . it will make the perfect beach bag for us , and could be used for almost anything .
0	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers . relegated to cleaning after just one use
0	got to be the toughest piece of leather a cow has ever produced ! i 've literally never had a pair of boots that need this much breaking in and i own lots of boots . makes me not even want to to wear them
1	i never seem to have luck shopping for bras , so just took a chance on these off of another review that i had read . they were a great deal and a wonderful fit . i would highly recommend
1	very nice basic clothing . i think the size is fine . i really like being able to find these shades of green , though i have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color . this is the only brand that i can find these muted greens
0	i never receive this item , i want may money back or replace my order
1	about 18-24 months ago , we purchased a pair of beach crocs for our daughter , child-toddler size 12-13 , like those pictured . she has used them for the beach , around the pool , wearing them to school on non-gym days , going on non-strenuous walks , and so forth . plus , we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools . even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1-1/2 , she still wears them . and , the shoes are in good shape ! also , daughter 's mother has been wearing her own pair , for similar uses , for about two years . so , we highly recommend crocs
1	i love these shoes ! tsubo is notoriously comfortable and these are amazing ! they are n't the prettiest shoes in the world , but i can spend 12 hours on my feet in them and my feet are happy
1	i am very happy with this product , its comfortable and good looking . worth buy ...
0	i placed order on 10/10 . i called blue blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10/16 that my order had not been shipped . i that it would be shipped that day . i was told that i may get my item 10/23 or 10/ 24 . horrible customer service . the shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long , but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item . i will not order from blue blood racing again ! !
0	i bought this dress for a trip i 'm taking in one week . should 've known better . you get what you pay for , that 's for sure . this dress arrived balled up in a usps bag . it did n't look anything like the picture shown on this site , more like a slip , than a slip dress . and here 's the kicker - it was ripped ! had two large `` snags '' on the back of the dress . i 'm sending it back and they better not try to charge me shipping . i 'm po 'd to the max and who knows if i 'll find a dress in time . grrrr
0	this cap was definitely not as cute as the picture . loose threads on it . looked cheaply made and this was bought as a gift . i would n't recommend this item . it definitely cost more than it was worth
1	the slippers are what i expected . with only a month , i can only say they do the job
0	very cute , i always get compliments , but i wear them only every so often and the bottoms are all ripped up - you 'd think i wear them everyday ! i 'm just upset i paid over $ 60 for shoes that will barely last one season
0	i purchased these shoes when i started working on a job that required walking almost the entire shift . my feet are killing me , after working for almost a month . there is no cushioning in them , nor much arch support
1	now this military style combat boot is one of a kind ! it takes a while to break it in but after , you will enjoy it ! it looks so cool just looking at it , never mind wearing it ! its leather is tops ! and it will last a life time ! not water proof , but great for jungle trekking ! shines easy
1	i bought this bag as a gift for a lawyer friend . she loves it , and has told everyone about it . the color allows her to express her personailty while remaining professional , and the size and durability of the bag allow her to eliminate a separate purse , lunchbag , and carryall
1	single style , good shoes . i think is a nice choice to every day work
0	i love all other crocs styles , but was very disappointed in the prima . they are too slim , and look odd and stretched out on me . they also tend to slip off in the back as i walk , yet the other styles fit me perfectly . great idea , but they should have worked on it more . i ca n't wear these outside the house
0	i got these for my son before he arrived in the 0-3 mos size ( blue ) . they were n't even blue , they were purple . and , they were so big they fit my 14 mo old , but the arms were too short for her to wear them either ! what a waste of money
0	this jacket is worst outerwear that i have ever seen , although the image might look good in here . my size is usually between medium and large , i ordered size medium . however , when i received and tried it on , i end up look like wearing xxx-large jacket . also , the craftmanship is very poor , the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing . i hate to return anything that i had order online because i have to waist my time to go to post office and i have pay the shipping and handling fee . nevertheless , i returned it yesterday . please do n't waist your money on this order , it 's not worth it at all .
0	these two packets of panties were too large . i also did n't like the cotton . since i had opened one packet of three i kept it , but i sent the unopened packet of 3 back because i did n't like them . jeanne allen
1	i like adidas brand and this is a great shirt for working out or whatever . it is comfortable and well worth it
0	i really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months . when they came i was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained . i was extremely disappointed that the product was defective , because i have never had a problem with any amazon products in the past , i sent it back and i was reimbursed for my purchase . i am really disappointed i will think twice before i purchase any shoes from amazon again
1	i got so many compliments on these shoes the first time i wore them to work . they are very pretty and preppy looking . i wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater . the green is very bright , so they do n't match everything , but it 's a standout accessory . wore them without socks and had no blisters
0	i bought this speedo because i like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design . the biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses . i own several speedo swimming trunks , this one is the worst . if the band can be improved , i will rank it at least 3 stars .
1	this case is really nice and compact . there is a nice place for a card or x-tra batteries inside . is snuggly fits the hp digital camera . protects well . and well padded . very nice case
1	these are so pleasing on the eye . what can i say besides the fact that these jeans fit great , look great , and attract alot of attention . buy them ! !
1	i have had these boots for one month , winter in alaska . i have been climbing a 1,000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long . it is winter , the temperatures range from 5f to 25f and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice . i am wearing one pair of medium weight smartwool socks and no gaters . to date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots . lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots . the lateral support is excellent and better than i expected . the fit is excellent and i have no slipping inside the boot ( yeah ! ! ! ) . for my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive , but they hold well . my four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside ... i think because of the shape of the sole at the instep ( so i have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel ) . light weight , but strong and sterdy so far . felt completely broke in right out of the box . not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down . i would highly recommend them so far
1	i bought brown burnished color of this variety . after i got them , i tried them on and these are , simply , fantastic . i liked the way they fit onto my feet . my feet are wide and hence i had ordered a wider version of these . they give you a very comfortable and stable feel when you have them on and walk around . the sole looks very sturdy and durable . does not skid over wet surfaces
0	well i guess the title says most of it . i am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so i have to put them in the washing machine with bleach a lot . then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed . i 've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dose n't work they look the same as before . but they are comfortable i also like the high arch in them . they are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives i would n't recommend them
0	very dissapointed in this outfit , looks really nice in pictures but is very cheaply made frayed the first time put on .
1	i purchased these boots hoping they would fit and not hurt my feet . i have arthritis in one foot and can hardly wear shoes because of the pain . these boots fit very well , look great , and i can wear them longer than any shoe i have had in the past year ! ! i love them
1	great jacket , excellent feel . only qualms are the quality of the zipper and the big bright label on the inside of the jacket . 5 stars for the leather itself , soft and very comfortable . change the zipper so that it doesnt jam on the way up 99 % of the time , and make the label much more subtle and this would be an awesome jacket ! also sad but not surprised to see this is made in chin
1	tops and bottoms are very comfortable and able to keep me comfortably warm at +30f to +40f with regular dockers and long-sleeve cotton/polyester shirt . they are lighter and less bulky than their all-cotton longjohn cousins designed for similar temperatures . they also dry much more quickly . as with all longjohns i have found on the market in the past forty-plus years , the tops are too short for anyone much taller than 6 ' ( now ) or 6'2 '' ( back then ) . sadly , i never see them listed in `` tall sizes , '' and , as always before , i have to tuck in the tops or hike up the bottoms over and over and over ... to make sure my waist is protected .
0	well , it is a cool product , and good idea to use . but the bulb was broken in first 3 days . we put the second one on . dont know how long this second one will last . we used it only few minutes in the morning , when we need to get some cloth out of closet . also , it is not on line product only . i found bed bath beyond has it and cvs has it . they sell 9.99 . without extra bulb . but still , misleading to say online only .
0	save your money and lock your luggage with cheap lock ties . our tsa lock was cut the very first time we used it . turns out the entire terminal has only 1 set of key so screener just do n't bother /have the time to unlock this approved lock .
0	we purchased these boots for my husband who works in the construction field ( mainly insulation instalation ) which requires him to climb in high places , walk on trusses , and also be under floors sometimes in standing water and other harsh weather conditions . in my opinion these boots do not have `` heavy duty '' rubber soles at all but cheap soles that start to rub and crumble almost immediately under working conditions . there is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself . there is a piece of leather saying `` made in china '' and that 's it . the tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole . the worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is . the seller did not state this fact . all in all , if you are purchasing these boots for long term wear or work related activities i do not reccomend them . if they are for a teenager making a fashion statement or for a halloween costume they 're perfect
0	am i the only one sick and tired of this t-shirt ? ? ? ? give it a rest already ! ! i ca n't browse without seeing it , the dead horse is beaten to oblivion ! !
1	this was my first time using amazon and it was great . i have bought other things over the net but by far this was the most seamless . lets do it again next time . lawhote
1	excellent product . item arrived fast and exactly as described . works like a charm . have n't yet had tsa open the lock , but it does the job
1	very quick delivery . price was very good compared to other online companies . will use again
0	this robe virtually fell apart when i washed it . it stained the inside of my washing machine . it raveled before i even got a chance to wear it . do not buy this product . i got the burgandy one . i am so disappointed by this product i may stop shopping at amazon
0	i would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all . the silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night .
1	awesome shoe ! ! very comfortable on my feet . even though it 's high healed sneacker you really do n't fee too much of height and none of it 's negetive side affects . i can actually run in this . only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really hot wearing it . i would recommend wearing thin sox . i originaly brought dark brown in size 7 ( normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe ) but had to return it to get 6. way too big . it 's wider than i 'm used to even though i have wide feet ; offers plenty of toe room . if they offer 6 1/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter . unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered . i wanted to buy black in 6 also , but 7 is too big and smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now
0	the fabric , texture and color were extremely cheap quality . it looked faded and unattractive i had to return it for a refund . do n't bother if you like good quality and nice clothes .
1	this sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets- just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame . i highly recommend it to those who do n't like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress
0	the wrong item was mailed to me . i checked the order after i recieved the item to make sure it was n't a mistake on my part , and it was n't . i recieved an armband for an ipod nano and i ordered an armband for an ipod video . luckily i was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back .
0	i was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice `` just because '' gift . when i opened the package i was really disappointed . the color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together . now i have to return the item because it just looks bad . the problem with returning is the non-refundable $ 7.50 to ship to me and the $ 5.95 i have to pay to ship it back to them . i also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who could n't find my order .
1	best sock in performance that i have ever tried . i buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed . no sagging , no defects . the only reason i toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use . one of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again . if they ever stopped making them , i would buy a 100 pairs just to know i would have them for my liftime . there ... i actually wrote a review on socks !
0	i loved this bra when i first got it a year ago . it gave me great support , it looked great and i was the happiest with a bra that i have ever been . my girls are in the f range so it has been difficult to find the right size . a year later , the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it . i am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $ 70 for one bra . they are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time . one year just does n't work for me .
1	the lilyette maximum support bra is well made and wears well . it holds up to frequent washings and retains its support features . it is comfortable
1	i made a bone head move and just bought one . it cost as much to send it as it did for one shirt . these people have areally good t-shirts . not thin , and they are stiched well
0	good features include many pockets . bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining . as a result , the two pockets where i carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks . avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets .
0	i am still waiting for these two pairs of gloves which were to have been usmailed and which were predicted to arrive yesterday , march 28
1	i have never been into full rim hats . i needed one for the work and rest i do so i gambled on this . i am very happy that i did . it fits perfectly , and already i have been through a twenty degree difference with rain , and being a glasses wearer , i can say i am definitely pleased . i recommend this hat for anyone looking for this type of product for any reason
1	this is exactly what i was looking for . it 's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips . feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff
1	i bought this pump in bonsai color . the pump was true to size . they are more cute than in the phot
1	finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating , large-breasted women is no fun , but this dress is pretty good . what this will not give you is any kind of coverage . if you 're ok with people seeing you with major cleavage , then this is fine . if not , just wear it to bed -- not in the hospital or , as i see some women do -- out of the house . yikes ! i think i 'd be arrested
0	shoe has a high back that kinda cuts in to your heel . i love clark 's , but not this pair
1	when i saw in a magazine that croc was making a style of their shoes that was not ugly , i literally went the same day to dillard 's to get a pair for myself ! they are unbelievably comfortable - it feels like you 're standing on clouds ! the amazon listing does n't show all the colors that they come in : light pink , silver , gold , celery , lavender , light blue , white , black and fuschia . all the colors are really adorable , and i had a hard time deciding ! i have also had issues with sizing , just as other reviewers have had . i usually wear a 7.5 wide in women 's shoes , but when i tried on the primas in an 8 , they were ridiculously big , and when i tried them on in a 7 , they were a tad too snug . i really wish they made half sizes . i ended up buying the 7 , even though it was a little small , but i read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet , that works like a charm : throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat , then pull them out , and while they are toasty warm , immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour , and voila , they will now fit perfectly ! grade : a-
0	i bought these at target for my sons . my six year old wore his two months until they fell apart . not too long in my opinion .
0	these are paper thin cotton and feel rough . they may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate ! a big thumbs down from me and i 'm usually a ck underwear fan
0	i have several pairs of clarks shoes that are wonderful . the lalita is very uncomfortable . they are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub . i was truly disappointed
0	ordered shoe in my usual size ; shoe was too tight . bealls does not have an exchange policy whereby they will ship a different size at no charge ; so i returned the shoes and got credit for the purchase , but not for shipping both ways
1	it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length . ya who . am
1	i first saw this webundies outfit when my friend sara brought them to our lingerie party and i have to admit , with all the other hot looking stuff there , i did n't have too much hope for these . well , was i ever wrong . you do n't need to be skimpy and revealing to be attractive to your man . these will do the trick . if your guy has n't been paying you the kind of attention you 've been wanting , get a pair of these , wear them to bed like pjs , climb under the covers , roll over pretend to go to sleep . i 'm betting he wo n't let ya
1	after having purchased the dlo sports case for my creative zen vision m , i read horror story after horror story about the case being too tight , scratching the unit , and even leaving a sticky residue on your valuable player . i looked around for a while before going with this package deal and i 'm happy i took the time to do so . the case is snug enough so your zen wo n't move around in it but it does n't button mash either . the download/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off . the power switch , headphone jack , and microphone all have openings that are completely functional . the belt clip , kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs . and finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason i bought this . the film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so i took mine off in the end . fortunately , these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it . and all of this for under $ 10 ? ? ? a great deal on an excellent product . highly recommended
1	i have to say , those crocs are the best . they are super confi , and light ... i recommend them
0	this wallet is fifty-fifty . the inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should . the outside , well ... ... the uncovered metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket ( ok ) but not good in the open . maximum number of bills - about 20 folded . occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used . the metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers . if the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse , other objects . so i started facing the clip in , resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh . but `facing in ' is very awkward when seated , like driving . definitely not designed for back pockets . why buy : as a second wallet ( one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards , ids so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen . put the small bills and one or two only small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you ) . as a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic
0	accustomed to the zipper pull tab being on the right hand side . all my other zippered garments come that way . this turfer men 's endurance shell jacket has the pull tab on the left side which makes using it feel majorly awkward . would not buy again for that reason . this shell is otherwise nicely made
0	this shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look wide . they run small . they look nicer in the picture than they actually are
1	this is a great and comfortable bra , and it works for me . it 's a minimizer , and is great for larger sizes . i exercise a lot and it provides great support , even good enough for running on the treadmill . i have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years . i am so impressed with them that i looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more , and it is half of what i paid in the mall . now it is all i wear for everyday : )
0	the shoes look and wear great . however , the leather is pretty weak . i think i must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them . now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it . i will have to try to cover it up by oiling it . obviously i do n't think this pair will last long at all
1	the denim on these jeans is lightweight and the touch of stretch renders them super-comfy , not confining like some stretchy jeans can be . they 're almost as comfortable as my sweats , and there are some weekends when i just live in these ! true to size , and i did n't have the shrinking issue another reviewer seems to have experienced
1	these are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine , are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking . it 's hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate .
1	this item was shipped quickly and on time . it stands out , not the same-old , same-old zip-up hoodie . would recommend this seller and item- ( to any yankee fan ) . thanks for reading . =
1	i did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect . however , the unisex width is way too wide for me . i have a pair of ugg men 's ultimate and they are not as wide . overall , i still think uggs are a little better and more comfortable
1	i 've had foot problems this past year . shoes that i had worn comfortably for years , including other rockports , ecco , new balance , avia , reebock , asics , etc ... , were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long . these rockports are great . i 'm finally not in a hurry to get home and get into my slides . i was to the point that i 'd pay $ 300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes . this shoe is well worth the money
0	i would not buy this product again . it hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end
1	i liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived . they fit my husband 's feet well and he likes them . the only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace .
1	i followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than i normally would and they fit great ! super cute with jeans or a sexy dress ! great job jessica
1	and i am very pleased with them . they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy
1	i find this store to be very accomodating . will definitely shop there again
0	the picture of the shoes was deceiving . did not want ankle strap . you could not go by the picture . which is how you do online shopping . returned the shoes .
0	a beautiful checkbook cover that even has a pen holder . but the problem is when i put the checks in ( regular sized ) the cover will not lay flat . perhaps it will after awhile but i 've never had a checkbook cover do this before . i ca n't recommend this item
0	i ordered a 11.5eee size slip-on shoe . despite the labelling in the shoes , they felt more like 12.5ee . in other words , too tight across the arch ; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops . unfortunately , the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them , which voids the company 's product return policy . anybody want a worn-once pair of shoes ... cheap ?
1	was shipped very promptly . not the largest man 's umbrella but well designed . looks like someone really studied how umbrellas can wreck themselves by blowing inside out . so that this one wo n't
0	the jacket itself its well made . but they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture..
0	first of all they did n't sent me the pictured panties , but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print . butt-ugly . second , they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse . returned right away . very disappointing
0	and poison ivy in my mouth would n't keep my hands warm . these things itch like hell . i know , they 're wool , but shut up . i think whoever made these had to steal the wool . no wonder they felt so bad . get it ? steel wool ? ugh , go away
1	this is the fifth pair of club cs i 've owned , the second in black . i believe they 're the best combination of durability and comfort on the market . i 'll undoubtedly buy another pair when these wear out
1	amazon notes that these socks are `` only made from the finest yarns . '' they mean it , too ! these socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber ; and they are very well made and last forever . i especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear . oh sure , these socks may cost a bit more -- but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves . the socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12 ; therefore it is almost one size fits all . a big plus ! i also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers . great ! i would not dry these socks at high temperatures . this could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot . eventually they will `` bunch up '' when you wear them and that 's very uncomfortable . dry these fine socks at a lower temperature . overall , you ca n't go wrong buying these socks . they keep your feet extra warm during colder weather . they are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money 's worth . a good deal ! smile
0	never charged a thing . i bought it to use on international travel . it stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in
1	great price - aprons are perfect for my mom . she just recently suffered a stroke and i needed inexpensive aprons to easily put over her head for when she eats that look nice and does the job . the company sent them out right away ; would order again . just wish they had more colors and designs to choose from . i order two packages , with 3 in each package
1	excellent quality for the price i paid . very happy with purchase . arrived in a timely manner
0	she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all
1	this item is great - study and well worth the money - light weight =- the only negative review would be with the company that i purchased from - they did not participate in the sale the site was running . other than that - they filled the order fast and was pleased with the service and the quality of this briefcase
0	i was disappointed when i got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin.i emailed the company i bought them from and requested an exchange/return many times . they never responded and i ended up keeping the shoes as i needed them for work . i would not purchase from this company again .
1	what a great pair of pajamas these are . so soft , non-binding , roomy , and great for lounging . i 've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays . very good quality silk , well sewn and tailored . i 'm normally an xl tall but the regular xl fit fine
0	this is the smallest extra large i have ever bought , my daughter is 125lbs and wears a size 2 dress and it 's super tight on her ... . this was very disappointing to say the least ... . if you normally wear a small in other things , i would suggest you buy the extra large in this . the quality of the material is great that 's what made me even give this product a 2..
0	i received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run . i did n't really buy this a3 for its `` functionality '' but rather the look . i thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool . however , i did not at all feel being `` propelled through every foot '' , and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff . i even poked it with my hand , oh man it 's hard . i also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness , but all i did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement . btw , if your feet are wide and flat like mine , it 's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes . *** update *** november 15 , 2006 it 's been 2 months since i 've been wearing these shoes , and i 've changed my opinion them . once you get use to the a3 sequence , they are actually quite comfortable . the honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now . maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible
1	i can only ditto what the other 5-star reviewers have already said . i have 1 of the 41 '' for summer and now 2 of the 50 '' for fall and winter . the colors remain solid after mutiple washes , and the price is great for the quality of these sleep shirts . also very comfortable . highly recommend ! ngmackie , dunwoody , ga
1	i am so in love with these jeans . i made myself a promise that when i buy jeans again , these are definitely the brand jeans i will be purchasing ! ! i am very pleased with the l.e.i . jeans to the full extent ! !
0	if you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you . the white is thin and you can see through it so i do n't reccomend buying white on this brand . the t-shirts run very small . a size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small . they are also short . 29 inches is short for a man 's t-shirt . if you are tall , i would not recommend this t-shirt . the t-shirt is soft , not scratchy and the style is nice . we only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through
1	my fav shoes- i can wear them to dress up or to dress down ... the review about how to adjust the slasp was very helpful to
0	was not the same boot from the pictures . got very sad when opend my packet
1	i have used this mat almost everytime i 've been outdoors . i have n't seen anything like it at any department store and its much cheaper than the mats at the beachside boutiques . it is an awesome value for the price .
1	i was shocked to see how high the heel was , and being in my 40s i was n't sure if i wanted to find out how they felt . but i had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how `` walkable '' and comfortable they were . i have worn them several times since then
1	i originally started wearing hanky panky thong panties b/c my husband purchased some for me awhile back . recently i stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again i 'm thrilled . i wear low rise jeans , shorts , etc and these low rise thong panties take the worry out of showing off my back side when i bend over or pick something up . i never feel as though i need to reach back to check to see if i 'm giving a show or not ! they 're just as comfortable as the others -- the just ride lower on your hips . they 're very sexy too ! i suggest ordering from bare necessities b/c they offer free shipping with any $ 40 purchase . that 's three pairs of thongs -- you ca n't beat that . and ... once you try these you 'll be hooked like me and be ordering them in every color ! go for it ! ! !
1	i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered , i like it . delivery is fast . i will order something else
1	i bought my wife the set and she loves it , everything from figleaves has beed great
1	this jacket is well-made , stylist and goes with a range of skirts and slacks . great addition to a professional wardrobe
1	i brought a pair of the beach/garden clogs from cozee world , the order was shipped quickly , and when i realized the size was wrong , they even allowe dme to exchange them for the correct size . it was overall good service . thanks
0	poor fit for 80gb ... stick on film to protect video face is a joke ... it 's cheap but save your money on this and buy something better
1	i would n't say they 're my favorite pair , but i definitely like them . soft , comfortable , sexy
1	... ..and they are very comfortable , quality seems to be better than the last unlisted shoe i purchased elsewhere . have n't polished them yet so i ca n't say anything about that
1	these are , by far , the most comfortable boots i have ever owned ! i am a huge fan of dansko clogs , and these frye boots are just as comfortable and sturdy ! they run a bit on the large side , about a half size difference . you will love them ! ! ! !
0	i never received this order and they have not responded to emails regarding order status . this left me without gifts for co workers over the holidays ... i am out the money
0	these slippers are not a bargain . they fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again . do n't buy 'em . they 're junk
1	this is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about . finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra ! i 've been using lilypadz for about a month now and i must say that i love them . when i started breastfeeding my daughter i was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks . i hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt , they do n't always absorb all the liquid , and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all . i assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because i did n't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed ! i have to admit , when i first saw them advertised i was skeptical . i did n't think they would stick , i did n't think they would stay in place , and i thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they 'd leave a tacky residue on my breast . i hestitated for a couple of weeks , wanting to try them , but afraid that i 'd spend all that money and end up disappointed . it was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night i decided i would risk it and order them . when they arrived i read all the instructions and was ready to try them out . now this is the embarrassing part ... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using . for some reason i thought they meant take them out of the plastic container . i did n't realize that each lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic ! when i first tried to put them on i actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out . ( yes it was tough to do too ! ! ) i was frustrated because they obviously did n't stick . i began to think that my fear of them not working was true . once i realized my stupid mistake , i peeled them off the plastic and tried again . they stuck perfectly ! ! try and avoid having the problem i did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes . i was immediately surprised at how secure they felt . i knew right away that i would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off . my next fear was removing them . i carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off . i was surprised that even though they stuck securely , they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts . i was estatic ! what a great product ! ! i have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons . however the pros greatly outweigh the cons . this is what i have found ... pros -- -- -- 1 ) attaches securely 2 ) removes with very little or no pain 3 ) no residue left behind on the breast . baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed . 4 ) protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads . ( if you are feeling sore these are a huge help . ) 5 ) secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra . 6 ) washable and reusable 7 ) invisible under snug fitting shirts . 8 ) when properly applied you will not leak 9 ) peace of mind 10 ) quick drying . after cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them ( even if they are a bit damp still ) . no need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up . one pair will work and will always be ready to use . cons -- -- -- - 1 ) if not properly applied you might leak . you must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on . however , even if you leak - it wo n't get on your clothes . instead it pools up around the nipple . it usually stays sealed . you just have to be sure to remove the pad , drain the liquid , rinse them and then reapply properly . one warning , if you have an air bubble and you leak a lot it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you . this has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping . i leaked during the night , woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if i had leaked on the other . my milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me . 2 ) if you own cats/dogs ... keep them away from the pads when you are n't wearing them . they attract fur like crazy . if they do get furry its ok because it does wash off . its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort 3 ) takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public ( vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra ) but once you get the hang of it , it woud n't even make the con list anymore . 4 ) i personally do n't wear them every day . i 'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little . i do wear them every night , but during the day i 'll occasionally wear my cotton pads so my skin can breathe . i 'm afraid that i 'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if i wore them 24/7 . i have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24/7 . i 'd say i wear them 3-4 times a week during the day . i will not go a night without wearing them though because i hate wearing a bra to bed . as you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit . the cons should n't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself . even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost . if you are like me and you are skeptical - do n't be . these really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try . every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and i think they would make a wonderful and unique baby shower gift !
1	these socks are a bit on the thin side , but they withstand a lot of wear
1	i use this all of the time . it gives good protection , ease of use , and good handling . only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock . however , this is true of any protective skin . outstanding product .
0	i took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately i gave them away after trying them on . the fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible
0	the length of the jacket could be a little longer ... bairly hits the belt
1	this is really a great item , very comfortable . i would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose . great for the intended purpose though
0	these gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined , however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger ... some people do n't mind the feeling -- personally it drives me nutty . it 's a present , however , so we 'll see how he feels about the material . my main gripe , however , is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor . right out of the package , the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up . the black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable . it 's an `` overstich '' and most of them look like they 'll start to loosen at anytime , causing the leather pad to come off . there are different colored threads poking out through seams as well . they do look nice from afar and seem warm ( i only tried them on quickly ) , but for the price ... yikes
1	stretchy , comfortable and made well- love this t-shirt ! ( also its a slim fit and not really , really long like many are right now- more of upper hip length , which is great if you want to tuck it in !
1	i bought this scarf with a gift certificate i received for christmas . i love it so much and my kids love it so much they are buying their own . it is super-warm and retains it shape , even after my nine year old tried it on as a dress
0	i bought this pair of shoes because the look really good but the shoe doesnot run true to size , i bought an 11.5m and had to return it because my instep could not enter the shoe . be very caefull when buying i suggest buying half a 1 size bigger than your average size
1	soo comfortable and soo warm . the only thing that sucks about them is that they are n't waterproof
0	my `` tween '' daughter loves these saucony jazz shoes . they are comfortable and stylish . this is her 3rd pair . i 'm glad that i found them online . they are both old-school and stylish
0	hey ! i 'm twelve years old and i just want to tell all of you other boys out there that you really need to try these . they feel really nice on the skin and they do n't bunch up as easily as boxers and boxer-briefs do . they also give really good support to your penis . they keep it in one place the whole day without the discomfort . boys , ya 'll all seriously need to try these undies out . they 're awesome
0	ok , for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra ! this bra is useless for me . it has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close , not so great for public nursing . and , for someone who is a 34-36 b-c it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place , the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage ! all and all i would not recommend this bra
1	the zipper pulls are somewhat ill-suited for the job , the only way i found to be able to zip the boots up quickly , easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain
1	my son 's favorite color is orange but finding an orange lunch bag this year was a tough find until i found this lunch kit . it is perfect : high qualtiy , great price , fast delivery . i am completely satisfied and will definately order again next year
0	even though i bought these for $ 9.99 i still somewhat regret it . the quality of the jacket is `` really '' poor . every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed -- from the pockets to the zippers . while wearing it , the jacket smells like `` paint '' or what they used to bleach the colors on . i hope the smell gets out after washing . i am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when i wash it and onto my other clothes
0	i never wanted to write one of these , but i feel i have to . i bought these boots , they were great , but one size too big . so i tried to exchange them . amazon does n't do exchanges ... ..apparently too difficult . on top of this , the price doubled after i bought them , so now if i want the boots , amazon will not honor the previous price . this is something that any dime store would do , but apparently one of the world 's largest online retailers could n't . this is very disappointing , and i would never recomend this company to anyone ... .ever ... .quite the opposite
1	i am thrilled to finally purchase birkenstock at a price that is fair . our local retail stores , mark them up , so ridiculously . thank you , amazon
1	i just recieved my shoes today and ca n't believe that these shoes fit perfectly . the wide size 8.5 is just what i needed . i am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as i would often have with other shoes . i love the value as i purchased these for only $ 19.79 .
1	this has to be the best beanie that i have ever purchased ... i wear it all the time , it fits perfectly and looks awesome !
0	item is not authentic . kenneth cole is all i wear and those shoes are not kenneth cole
0	i was happy at the appearance of the bag , but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack . i received it around christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell . it still smells making it unable to use
1	i 've been wearing this bra for years . it just ca n't be matched for comfortable fit , no wires , no seams . whatever your shape you can `` shake yourself '' into it
1	fits , great quality , great sale price- if your lucky you do n't get what you pay for
1	the slippers are great ; comfortable and good quality . just like the pair i purchased in lake george a few years ago . buying them online was so convenient
0	i bought this for the flashlight feature . you have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on . also , the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on . the buttons on the front are cheap and do n't seem like they 'll last very long
1	i have been searching for the perfect ped sock , not too thick , not so thin it slides off your heel and , most importantly , cotton . my search is over . this is by far the best sock ever . great with sneakers and closed in shoes .
0	i just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs ( from another online company ) because they seemed inexpensive , durable , and came in many fun colors . i was sorely disappointed . the colors are pretty , but the material is crummy . its rough , flimsy and feels like plastic . the pastel colors ( citron , cool mint etc ) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear . the tops run quite large ( i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is very roomy , i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again ) .
0	ok , i do n't why this bra is available in any size larger than a b cup , because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust ( i see that is available here in 38 dd , and i shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing ) . it 's comfortable enough to be worn around the house , under jammies , for a little support when just relaxing , but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day , this bra wo n't do it . the front closure just does n't allow for any lift or support . unless you possess a smaller chest , skip this one
0	i bought this watch from rei . the first one 's electronics gave it up on the first night when i connected it to the pc . on the second two the plastic housing started separating . that 's right , i had to return the watch three times , the 3rd time i just wanted my money back . also , it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading . too bad , the watch sounded so good..
1	i bought this bra because i was tired of seeing `` nursing bra '' lines under my shirts . this is great . i bought the l++ and it fits perfectly . i am a 38ddd normally and durring my pregnancy a 40ddd was fitting too . if you buy this bra , you will love it , just buy the correct size
1	if other underware binds you , you have finally found one that does n't . the pouch is very large , lots of room ! i bought an additional dozen and threw all my other brands away
0	this shoe is like having a hard piece of plastic under foot
0	the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that i did n't even try it on . it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that did n't go with the main color of the suit . very poor choice for a grab bag . taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company
1	i have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong . i work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether i am on site , at home , out on the town , etc . these are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag
0	these boots look very nice , but unfortunately , it is way too narrow ( and i have narrow feet ) . my whole foot felt squashed . back to amazon it goes
0	i ordered these items in mid june , and my credit card was billed on june 22 . however i discovered two weeks later that , despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from andrew christian , the order had never been sent to them . i was then assured that the order would be completed promptly ( i told them i needed the clothing by july 19 , otherwise i would not need the items at all ) ) . the order was not given to ups until july 17 with an expected delivery date of july 21 . consequently i directed ups to return the order unopened . the handling of the entire mess was slopppy , and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful .
0	these did n't do the job as far as keeping my nipples from poking out so much . they do have great adhesive . also no good if you are trying to hide the darkness of the areola , because they are pretty small . i used every pair , just thinking i was putting them on poorly , but everytime , i was a pokin
0	sizes run small . zipper is short and so are the over the shoulder straps which does not allow for much adjustment . i should have spent a couple bucks more and got dickies or another brand
1	as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present `` one size fits all , '' it becomes increasingly difficult for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in anything other than the most expensive brands . these shoes are well made and an excellent value . the only negative is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer to make them narrow . the heel tends to wallow a little bit in my particular case
0	i bought these slippers for my husband at christmas time . i thought if i spent $ 50 on slippers they would last a long time , and be made very well . i was wrong . the slippers look good , and the upper leather is very nice but the sole is a cheap , thin foam . if you bend it , it snaps . you would expect to find this on a cheap , $ 2 flip flop . i was very disappointed . i bought my husband a cheap $ 2 pair of suede slippers in walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole .
0	after only one week use at home , the sole was completely broken . the worst quality slipper i have ever seen
1	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i ever owned . excellent quality and fit .
1	the product arrived in a reasonable time frame and was what i had ordered . i really like it
0	i ordered the jacket pictured , but i received an entirely different bernardo jacket . customer service re-ordered for me and i got the same incorrect jacket . i would n't bother ordering this unless customer service assures you that their inventory glitch has been corrected
1	bought this as a gift for my husband who loves the movie . he loved it from the minute he saw it . whenever he wears it it seems that someone makes a positive comment about it . it is amazing how many fans of the movie there are . a great gift for holy grail fans
1	i got custom fit for this bra at nordstrom 's and i am so happy that i purchased it - among others that day . i had lost 55 pounds and was looking to update my image and had gone through about 4 bra sizes on my way down . hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $ 65 i spent on the le mystere bra . it is unbelievably comfortable and since i am a `` light '' 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect c. plus it gives me a `` bump '' and just the right amount of cleavage . i can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top . one thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since i am 5 ' 1 '' and a size 2 that works well for me as i am pretty small framed . it took a bit to get used to `` them '' being so `` out there in front . '' so if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you . i love it so much that i now have this in all 3 colors and 2 of the bare color as i am very fair skinned .
1	a very cool product , it got me a lot of attention on 3/22/07 at the ou student union . at first , it was hard to work . but now , i can even spin ! ! ! i always wear them to my mom 's office
0	i love the bears . it 's impossible for any bears fan to not love walter payton . with that love i ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from fansedge . the shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay i had the jersey delivered to my doorstep . it went downhill from there . as soon as i opened the package i noticed that the 'gsh ' ( george s. halas ) initials had been sewn over and was broken . very disappointing . i called fansedge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey . while waiting for the replacement jersey i wore the defective one . by the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off . i figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one . it was exactly the same way . so either fansedge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it . after asking and waiting 2 weeks for fansedge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply ... i cancelled my order . i am still waiting for a refund . this has been over a month now . with the poor support of fansedge and what appears like a poorly made jersey i can not recommend anyone getting this . if you absolutely want one i recommend buying from a brick and mortar store . 1/
1	i wore these shoes when i worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet , ankles , knees and hips . i could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the `` teeth '' in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good . being diabetic , i am very concerned about circulation and i believe this was a good purchase . a little expensive , but well worth it in the end . i plan on buying more
0	should n't amazon address this in some way ? if it is real i would buy it ; if it is fake ( and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score ) should n't this be off amazon 's site ? i think it becomes an issue of amazon 's credibility..
0	the product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was . my son exchanged it
1	way beyond my expectations . exceptionally fine cotton , changes colors in the light , great fit , absolutely beautiful -- great delivery . thanks so much
0	these `` cover ups '' are very thin , a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun . the colors are pretty , but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps . they are cheap , good thing because i ca n't imagine what to use them for . i 'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item .
0	item was called `` fleese '' but was 80 % cotton and looked felt like a regular sweat shirt . to return an item to them , they give you free mailing , but they will deduct $ 5.95 off the refund for s after calling them about this , they agreed to give us a full refund . but the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles . i doubt that makes many consumers happy . champion makes a fine line of products , but i will never deal with them on line agai
0	bought one for my new ipod nano , a total disappointment . very poorly made . only glued together not stiched up , it already started to go apart . you wo n't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small . plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one 's self when walking or working out . it looks pretty but that is all
1	my son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class
1	i brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party , because i knew the girls would like them . i 've been wearing them for over a year and i like them a lot . my husband does too . they look good , turn him on , turn me on too . you ca n't ask for more than that in a panty , now can you
0	bah , this skirt looks weird and cheap . it is not sewn on the bottom , just cut .
1	the socks were nice but cost too much . price a little unreasonable
1	this jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip . this is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect . it will keep you perfectly dry . you will sweat a little on a warm day , but it is well worth the money for a cheap , dependable and totally waterproof suit . enjoy the rain and mud .
1	more than pleased ... excited . the price was better than local stores ; should have purchased several pairs . easy on the feet , wear well , and on and off at the airport
0	these bootie/slippers are terrible . they do n't ever stay on , there 's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made . i would give these 0 stars if i could , it was a complete waste of money- do n't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are
0	the pants that i ordered for my size were very small . they were n't true to size at all . i would not recommend this item to anyone
0	i bought 2 of these least year . first the id info came off enroute , then the green rollup part came off coming back . will not purchase again
1	my son loves the jersey - a little pricey but a nice jerse
0	the advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving , because it does n't properly show it . from what i saw on the amazon site , i thought the wallet will be much bigger . amazon does n't give measurements of the product , and there are not enough pictures of the it . basicly it is n't worth it to buy a product if i 'm not sure of how it looks like . now i have a wallet that my husband does not want , and i can do nothing with it . i feel that i wasted $ 25.00
0	first , let me say that i was very impressed with the shipping speed of this hat , which was nice because i bought this as a last-minute gift . though , with that said , there is a big difference between straw and straw-paper . this hat is straw-paper . i 'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain . i really think amazon should improve this hat 's description
1	my favorite underwear right now , the pima cotton is very soft . if you want an alternative to boxer briefs , these are great . if you are kinda between sizes , round up
0	out of style ! all the girls make fun of me for wearing levi jeans . they say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style . the fit , quality , durability , and comfort level do not seem to be as good as they were two decades ago . there is definitely a noticeable difference , and not a positive one . the price far exceeds the value - overpriced !
1	these shoes are the best ! i like the removable wheel ! you could heel to school and when you got there you could take your wheels out so nobody will know that you have them on ! you will be heeling across the floor in no time if you keep practicing on them ! it took me a while to get the hang of these shoes ! you should be absolutely satisfied when you try out these shoes ! they are the only shoes with removable wheels in the heels !
1	i am writing to u because i returned this item for exchange on size and print . what is the status of my exchange ? thank u and hope to keep shopping your products , they are great
0	mail fraud , i believe its called ! ! texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell . i 'm surprise amazon.com is even associating with them..and mike to get this bent out of shape over a $ 12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues .
0	i have been wearing boyshorts for ages , and i gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute . the fit is horrible ! ! ! the seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places . i mean , the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies ! i even bought them a size larger , because some brands tend to fit a little snug
0	i have to say that i was disappointed when i opened up the package containing my ipod wallet . it 's cute , but not $ 60ish cute . first of all , it 's not leather , it 's nylon . the lining is indeed suede , but the photos in the product listing are misleading . i 'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back , etc . is n't worth it . it does the job , but it was n't what i was expecting . i feel ripped off
0	i bought these because they cost less than uggs . but there is no comparison . my old uggs ruled , were totally comfy and warm . i bought these because i did n't have the money for uggs and they said they were `` sheepskin '' . when i recieved them they looked and felt different . the fur was not `` curly and fluffy '' like the uggs , it was relatively short and not as soft . i called bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic . but after several calls the owner told me `` they are not 100 % sheepskin , they are blended with merino wool '' which is not stated anywhere on amazon or their website . also i am a designer/ decorator and i am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and i still say they 're synthetic . i returned them , at my cost , and am waiting for a refund . you get what you pay for ! i probably could have bought a better pair at payless . what happened next : they promised me they would refund my money if i returned the boots at my cost , instead they sent them back to me with no refund . nice
0	these shoes are cute but not practical at all . i generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes i have ever tried on . i ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version . these are really narrow in the two , my foot feels so constricted in there , they totally cut off your circulation . and forget about even trying to walk in these . very poorly constructed . the peepttoe slings however are great , fit true to size and are comfortable .
0	these body suits are awful ! when i first saw them i was really relieved that i had found something that would be good for the summer months . i put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs ! the suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label . i am so disappointed and angry . it was a waste of my money .
0	not only charged 8.99 for it , 6.99 for shipping ! its a cheap plastic toy . but my grandson begged for it , and against my beter judgement , i ordered it . save your money . its worth a buck , if that . i cant believe they have the nerve to sell it and not expect complaints for this garbage . shipping is a complete rip off , and i will never order from this company again
1	these work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable ! it does n't say so on the box , so when i first got them i thought they were way too small for adult heads and i was quite annoyed - however , you can adjust them once you put them on , just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly
1	i tried this shoe at shoe carnival today . it was on sale for $ 49.99 . needless to say , i bought it right away at amazon since it was $ 39.99 ! it fit me really well , i walked around the store and the strap stayed fastened , it was comfortable all around . i really like the mesh material at the toe area . i 'm hoping this would mean that my toes will be well ventilated during warmer summer months ! this is a very comfortable trendy shoe that is a good option for those wanting to look hip while wearing something comfortable to include more walking steps in their work day . it 's also a great shoe for those not wanting to expose their toes wearing sandals but want them to breathe .
1	my husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing . we love them . i gave him two pair for christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently ... seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these . they look great too
1	sharp set of shoes . comfortable , too , and they fit well . but i believe they were shipped on cinderella 's coach - while the mice were still mice . it took forever to arrive , so be warned
0	product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available . tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back . bad experience
0	the pic that i ordered showed a knee length half slip . instead i received 3 long half slips from her room . i can not use the long half slips and i sent them back . also , i had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and could n't find where to apply that , so the cost was put on my visa . thanks . jeanne alle
0	i ordered this buckle , the one shown in the pictures , and i received a different buckle , a red white and blue confederate flag , not the knife/buckle
1	i just love the color and the way it looked on me . it is a very very pretty jacket
1	i 'll start with my stats : i 'm a size 8 , 5'2 '' , and i carry my weight in my rear and thighs ( all extra 20 pounds of it ) . this skirt is lovely , it hides what should never be seen ( refer to the 20 pounds above ... ) and helps create a slimming line . i 've worn it with silk blouses , stockings , and high heels and i 've worn it with slouchy sweaters , tights , and chunky mary janes -- it works perfectly with both
1	this is a great wallet ! it fits into small purses . the purpose of this is just to hold a few cards , your id and a small zipper section for some money . it 's not meant to be a complete , big wallet . i love it because it fits into my small purses and so easy to carry around . i do n't have to shove and push my bigger wallets into my purse and not have room for anything else anymore . love it !
0	the bra came well packed , speedily and it is very like the picture and description . the fit is good
0	you 'd better be stone cold sober when you wear these shoes as the sole is n't flat but goes up on the sides making balancing very difficult . why in the world they would make it this way is beyond me
0	the shawl is very thin , not good quality , i suspect it is not cashmere at all , but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools . the color was supposed to be expresso , not even that promise was fulfilled , it is a much lighter brown . i do not recommend this shawl at all
1	i actually purchased the silicone skin case and detachable belt clip as a gift for my boyfiend . he loves and it was much cheaper than the one creative offers on their website .
0	these boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that i wore them out , although each boot split along the outside , toe sole after approximately 10 wears . these splits , although tiny , allowed my socks to get soaked when splashing through our giant west coast puddles . i still wear them , but now only for fashion instead of function
1	these are the softest - most comfortable flips flops i have found in years ! you ca n't beat the price either
1	i was very satisfied with my purchase and am in the process of ordering more hats
0	very hard to use , maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier . do n't buy if you are planning to use immediately . this is where is i got very discouraged . just have n't had the time to play with it so it 's sitting in the box
0	i keep tyring to find shirts that are for these prices $ 9,10 or 11 , where are they ? how do i find out
0	we have not opened the package . the item is advertised as one size . without a notice that the one size is not `` one size fits all '' it is xl ( grand plus for those that speak french ) . my wife wears a size 2 or 4 . obviously this was a waste of money
1	after having plastic tags crack and break off my suitcase , a leather bag tag is what i needed . they stay on the suitcase and do n't break
1	this is the absolute best sport bra made . i have been running 5 miles or more 5 times a week for over 20 years and once i discovered this particular model i have never switched back . the champion also lasts wash after wash without losing it 's shape . unfortunately these great bras never seem to go on sale
1	i 've owned this coin pouch for several months now and it has held up exceptionally well to repeated use , proving to be an excellent and extremely durable holder for loose coins and eliminating the need to dig in one 's pocket for spare change
0	this product was disappointing . not at all what was expected and sizing was way way different than expected . i guess they will make a nice gift for my 12 year old niece since that is the type of body that a womens large will fit
0	i usually wear a men 's medium waist for athletic shorts ( umbro , adidas , nike ) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise . just to be safe i ordered a large . the shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs are n't overly long . the waist fits well but if you 're looking for a pair of workout shorts , i 'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg .
0	look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs . the elance is poorly made and designed , jockey is barely evern trying . look on the web guys , there are better choices ... . jockey 's elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame
1	great flats ! compact and small for those who have too many shoes already . the only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot , but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time .
1	warm and soft . i have used this brand for years and they have never caused skin problems . this brand is warmer then those without the fuzzy inside
1	these are some really good glasses . plenty dark , full mirrored so you wo n't be caught checkin out all the ladies you walk by . shoot , for $ 18 you ca n't go wrong . i highly recommend them . and since i 'm a pilot , it was obvious that i got a pair of these
1	bought these several months ago at ross dress for less in oregon for $ 19.99 i love them i bought them in a off white since that was the only choice . love the comfort of them , think the t-strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide sloppy on my foot the t-strap is cushioned so it does n't hurt my wee toes , i wear a size 8-8 1/2 depending on the brand these say 39.5 do n't know if that is correct sizing or not , i would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals , perfect for the beach or casual summer wear . i am a self-professed shoe addict these are great for those days you want only comfort
0	i never received this item when i was promised it , so it was cancelled and my account was credited
0	the phrase `` more efficient sourcing '' means that lands end is now buying these in china . the pants arrived with a strange smell ( fishy odor ) , the fit was odd , and , after one washing , the fabric looked bad . they went back asap ! i bought khakis from lands end for over a dozen years until this recent product change . notice the past tense . ownership by k-mart holdings is definitely making an impact on the company
0	i bought 5 pairs , had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths . the 4 remaining were much too long -- the ends of the pants were under my heels . i knew they 'd shrink , but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low , they barely reach my ankle bone . i like my pants longer than that . and they 've faded to navy blue , even though i used woolite for dark laundry . nothing else has faded as much as these pants . also , they 're lighter weight than they used to be . i used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern new england , and they were warm enough for just about anything . now the wind whistles through them . sorry , land 's end ; i 'll try ll bean next time
1	i was very happy with my last order . it was easy to order and did n't take long to get the product . my grandson was a very happy little boy on christmas morning . thank you so much for the great services.i will use amazon again and tell my friends about i
0	i purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because i have a hard time walking in really high heels . they are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap does n't hold my foot firmly in the shoe . when i walked around in them , i could feel them `` flopping '' . also , anytime i raised my foot ( to simulate my fiance taking off the garter ) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe . so , just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe . for the price , this is not worth the buy
1	this fanny pack is superb . the design is very roomy : a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered , and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag . also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment , and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body . as yet i have n't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt . the leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade . all zippers work well . extra large belt . i am a new fanny pack wearer , so it does take some getting used to the bulk and weight in the front waist area , but it beats the strain of shoulder straps , hand bags , etc . i use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device , the size of a small cell phone . similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over $ 70 without all the features of this one . it arrived soon after i ordered it . i recommend it highly . you wo n't be disappointed .
1	i purchased 2 other bags before finding this one . it is awesome . the canon s2 is is a hard camera to find a case for that is n't way too tight or super big . i wanted a bag for my camera and the original accessories that came with it . this bag fits it all perfectly ! ! it is n't too small or too big . the camera fits perfectly without squishing it in the main compartment and has a little bit of room left for the usb cord or whatever else you want to put in there . i would n't recomend this bag if you are looking for a bag to hold additional lenses is , it is n't big enough for that
1	i was a little nervous about ordering clothing from the internet . not knowing if it would fit . i think that the sizing chart used for this particular product works well because the produt turned out to fit just right . also , the picture is on key with the actual product . my loved it and so do i
0	these are nice shoes , however the sizing is way small ! i would recommend ordering at least a size or two larger than what you normally wear
0	the actual bag itself was great . however , the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not . i ordered this bag and three weeks later it came . i had to go buy a bag to take on vacation . kind of defeated the purpose
0	do n't buy these . i used to love florsheim ( i still wear an old pair of comfortech 's ) but i got a bad pair of these
1	you can kind of see through them , kind of not . the skirt is like a nifty mini , the g-string is not uncomfortable . this outfit looks good on my girlfriends , looks good on me and it 'll look good on you too
0	look , it 's on sale ! usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00 . and you wo n't find anyone else wearing this original . make your drunken friends dizzy with envy . spill anything on this shirt , it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill . worth every penny . as a bonus , you can also wear this shirt while hunting .
1	the shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress . however , there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process . i have n't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in . i do appreciate the covered toe which i feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it 's not obtrusive and does n't ruin the look of the shoe at all , but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged . the ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility is n't impeded . i live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking , so the waterproof claim is reliable . overall , for the price i 'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase
1	i love these shoes ... in fact i ordered another pair in black . they are very comfortable and look cute . hey ... ca n't beat that
0	illuminator is shown in ad , but a generic brand was shipped to me . the light was n't as bright and it was n't made very well.the crank was cheaply made , and the button that you press did n't work every time .
1	i travel a lot , especially during the summer months , and these packs are the best thing since ziplock bags ! ! they are a must , in all sizes , for the traveler . helps things and people get/stay organized ; an absolute must ! !
1	my twin sister bought these for me , and initially i thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable . breaking them in was n't so hard - although the little 'ball ' part made the top of my foot hurt at first . but now , they feel stable , comfortable and easy to walk it . they feel perfectly balanced and i 've never experiance blisters in these shoes . two thumbs up
1	like the photo implies , and like most 2 ( x ) ist men 's products , this underwear is sexy , comfortable , flattering and made of quality materials . believe me , this trunk truly has a pouch . a big one . its actually just the right size for me , and i am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it . the lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas , so its really nice . of course , the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this `` no-show . '' i had no problem with this being no show , wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it . basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants : ) for me , this trunk was not uncomfortable , given its diminished size and intent to be no-show . granted , in those moments of excitement , things do get a little more - eh , crowded . but a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear . i did not experience much more discomfort than i did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk . this pair is made of 100 % cotton , so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the x-factor line may enjoy this feature . my only complaint is that the leg openings do not `` cling '' to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon , etc . but that is just minor . the waistband is , as always , a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height , in keeping with the no-show design . may i suggest you go for the extra-bold 2 ( x ) ist no show trunk 3133c , which comes in contrasting colors - same product , same price , just sexier ! i can not reccommend this trunk enough , and within hours , it became my favorite 2 ( x ) ist product in my collection
0	the scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated . i have two problems with the scarf : 1 . i thought `` sheer '' meant sheer . 2 . i expected the edges to be finished ( hemmed )
0	the sizes listed do not print on the invoice . instead , army navy uses 'codes . ' when they send the wrong sizes , then they blame you for not selecting the right size and want a 15 % restocking fee plus return shipping
0	in my case , the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough . my feet are size 14 and eee width ( but some ee made on wide lasts can fit ) . the boots that i received were marked 14 ee but would n't even allow my feet half way in . i wish they fit because they look good , the quality is good , and price unbeatable . however , i lost $ 8.50 at the ups when i sent them back
1	these shoes are stunning , original and over-the-top beautiful . i just ca n't understand the review regarding the point of the shoe being too pointy ? ? square-toe shoes are soooo late 90-s and these shoes are anything , but `` mosquito hunters '' . they have a perfect narrow shape , with an interesting mix of fabrics and a perfect toe for the current late decade of 2000 . trust me , with 117 pairs in my exploding new york closet these have ended up at the front . i 'm picking up the black ones as i 'm writing this . enjoy them ... .i know you as well as your better half will !
0	these are made of a nice material and good for travelling . however , the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing . as soon as i sit , nothing is really being covered . with a longer inseam , these would be awesome
1	the quality is much better than expected . i bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our las vegas trip sept. 6 , 2005 . we were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities , our cell phones , travelers checks , keys , and medicines in particular . we love the spacious divided compartments . i highly reccommend this product..
0	i had purchased this bra , it was recommended by a fitter , so i tried it on , it felt comfortable enough . i am a 36 dd , after 3 wearrings all i did was sag , it did not hold it 's shape , and i hand wash all my lingerie . this is the worst bra , and very pricey . makes you look wide , not a very good garment , for me anyway.. try the champion 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort , great t shirt bra , there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also . this one i hated and i had purchased more than one , just wore them till they died , and they died fast ... i truly beleive in the bali bra , vf is good to , after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway , why spend more than $ 40.00 ... thanks , hope this helped ...
1	i absolutely love these shoes . i have a very high arch and i am a hard heel-striker . needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore . these shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches . however , i did put an extra arch support insert in ( did i mention i have really high arches ? ) but did n't get the usual `` crowding '' effect which was wonderful . i 've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away . these shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box , i 've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever . i plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to `` improve '' them and changes something . boy do i hate it when i finally find a shoe i like and then the company decides to 'improve it ' and screw up a really great shoe ( bitter much ? gee not me ) i also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where i live . good service all around . hope this helps someone else .
1	the robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner . my boyfriend absolutely loved his christmas gift ! thanks again ! : -
0	i had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products i received
0	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers . relegated to cleaning after just one use
1	i am very happy with my velour slippers .they are a perfect fit and very comfortable.i received my order promptly and plan to order again in the future
1	i really like the speedo suit . i wear two swim suits , the speedo and a larger `` drag '' suit over it . i 've done this since my days on the swim team . the chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time , causing the drag suit to self-destruct eventually . having the speedo prevents any embarrassing moments . the fit and material is good and it holds up very well - this is the first replacement i 've needed in years . if you are husky , this might be a tight fit . i wear a 42-44 pant size and this is on the snug side .
1	these shoes not only look great but feel wonderful . they are so light weight and comfortable . great product at a great price
1	these wellies ( rubber boots ) are a show-stopper ! i get lots of comments on how smashing they look - and they are very functional - i wear them in the garden , on the beach ( can walk into pretty high water without getting wet ) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking . very happy with them and the price was right too
1	i bought this for my wife as a `` throw in '' with more expensive items because it was so cheap.i actualy forgot i even ordered it until it came in . i was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me . unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture . she is a size small and it fit perfect . this not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me . the only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up
1	we needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from babies r us . the stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair . we 've got a svan high chair ( the best ! ) that has a pretty small opening for the kid 's torso , so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain . also , when cleaning , if you got the back ( fabric ) side of the bib wet , the bib would be cold and wet for hours . the bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up . they will be totally dry by the next meal ! they are so soft that our daugher does n't mind wearing them . they do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked ( assuming our daughter does n't pull the bib up to look for `` bib goodies '' in the pocket ) . we bought 2 sets and could easily use more . they can also be washed in the washing machine ( no dryer but they air dry super fast )
0	this jacket is extremely poorly made . i have it in black , but i should say black and white , because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through
1	this case is so cute and matches my green ipod perfectly . i read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the ipod , but i have n't had that problem . the belt clip works great with this and feels very secure . the other review said the cut-out for the wheel is off a little , and i guess she is right . looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel is n't centered , but it is completely accesible and i have no trouble using it . overall i love this case
1	look what i found ? where ? under there ! under wear ? ... right there ! it says , `` be the first person to write a review '' for jockey boxer briefs . hmmmm ... no wonder no one has reviewed these yet -- who writes a review for men 's underwear ? ok , fine , i 'll do it . i love these , my preferred brand and style . your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item . i only buy these in black as i am a firm believer that underwear ( men 's especially ) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it 's time to change them -- it 's better to be left wondering what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background ! these hold up well for the price . nothing lasts forever . the elastic band is usually the first to go ( after many repeated washings ) before the material gives out . i.e . they will fall off before they rot off . finally , so i can feel like i have done a complete job in reviewing these , i had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the weggie test - and these shorts handled it well ... extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed . i give these a `` ten tippy toes '' rating for how well they performed in the test .
1	these shoes are beautiful and comfortable . i wore them at a new year 's eve wedding ... danced all night with no sore feet ! this is my third pair of carlos shoes , love them
1	these are very cute and they fit great . i wear them all the time
0	i bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs ( with socks ) . i had to return them due to several issues : the inside lining was too slippery . i went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction ! tightening them did not work , as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot , leaving open sores . even when walking at a normal pace , the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when i stepped . thirdly , the sole of the shoe is very narrow ; it felt like walking in ice skates ! these were very cute ... and may be great for biking , but not so great for everyday walking
0	how lame ... 30 days later , no shipment , no delivery . very disgusted . information about shipment ship method : usps tracking number : 910 status : in transit order # : 103 shipment date : jul 17 , 2005 destination : west hollywood , ca , united states estimated arrival : jul 26 , 2005 date time location service area checkpoint details jul 19 , 2005 -- - us carrier notified to pick up package jul 17 , 2005 05:19:00 pm hebron ky us arrival scan
1	these boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest . i was pleasantly surprised . i was trying to replace a pair i had accidentally washed in the washing machine ( a no-no with this fabric ) . turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what i had originally purchased . i will probably be purchasing more . your wife will thank you for buying these . excellent quality , and softer than satin . my only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes , because it 's made without a fastener . the idea is for a sleeker feel , but it sacrifices security . love 'em anyway
0	these were a gift at christmas , and were a deep burgundy color . they do appear to be well stitched . however , after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading , and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore . the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !
0	there 's a fine line between tacky and hip , and these slippers are not it . these slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person . also , the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber-y fabric . they 're not made for warmth . all around disappointing
0	i have returned the shirt from amazon/macys . i did not like it and i am still waiting for my refund . i purchased it in january . where 's my refund . i will not buy from companies that do n't offer free shipping . i was charged to recieve it and also to ship it back . ms. michelle watso
0	this corset is not well made at all . it 's made of really cheap plastic boning and the boning sticked out after just a night of wear . ( i wore it to the club one night and by the end of the night the boning sticked through the top .
1	all aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them , and these are no different . i 've worn them with skirts , slacks and jeans , my daughter ( teen ) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair . i liked my black pair so much that i bought them in brown also
1	i really love the way these shoes look . i am really picky about shoes i buy . i dont like to have my toe cracks showing when i wear shoes and i was afraid that these might do that . they actually do show a little toe crack but only at the end where my little toe is . i wore these shoes all night on new year 's eve and had no problem . i also wore them all day at work and then to the mall afterwards and did have a little discomfort but not as bad as you would expect with shoes this high . i love these shoes so much a have 2 pair , black and red .
0	i have purchased these beloved sport pants for years . the cut of these pants has been changed with this order . the quality of the cut and fabric is much lower now . i returned the item
0	i do n't want this order.when i look into this it said it wasn , t available , so i looked into something else . if there is anything else that you have that i was to order please cancel everything because i have n't ordered anything else from you and anything that was ordered in february i do n't want now..thank you..
0	i 've been buying land 's end sport knit pants for over 15 years ( land 's end clothing for much longer ) . they 've redesigned these completely ( and are doing this to all of their women 's pants ) . do n't be fooled into thinking you 'll be getting what you used to order . also , this resizing / redesigning of women 's pants is systemic . ll bean is discontinuing their similar perfect fit pants and having all of their pants ( knit or otherwise ) resized / redesigned . here 's just a few of their improvements ? among the changes : the waist band ( height/width ) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches . it now rolls ! fun - not ! next , the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches ( =/- .5 inch ) relaxed ( when not being worn ) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches ! it was great fun to put on the ones i ordered , and even after washing them , i thought i must have changed bodies overnight . the waist just hung ... .. dare i put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down . when i tried walking in them , that 's exactly what happened and i was constantly having to pull them back up . i had to pin the waist to keep them on ... that 's not all the changes ... .. they 've enlarged the bottom legs by four ( 4 ) inches ! no more slightly tapered leg . the front rise has shrunk from 12.5 to 11.5 . if i wanted my belly button to show , i 'd go pull out a pair of my 70 's hip huggers ... .. the back rise has increased from 15 to nearly 16 inches . did my rear suddenly increase in size ? i think not . they claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz . ( old was 6.7 oz ) . the ones i am returning are less substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you ca n't with my old ones . next , it seems they have also extended the inseam length . it was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after . the ones i received after being washed had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches . finally , as if i was n't feeling self conscious enough about my bod , the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs . do you get the picture ? the waist sags and rolls . the seat is major baggy . my belly button shows . they have to stretch across my hips so there 's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch . they are sucked tight to my thighs , then ballon out from my knees to the feet . they 're too long , so you ca n't even see my feet . i spent 30 minutes on the phone with a `` specialist '' at land 's end and she could n't explain why all the changes . that 's also where i got all of the above new specs . also , spoke with a specialist at ll bean and their new specs are identical . i spend so much each year with land 's end that i get a gift and card at chrismas from them . so , i 'm not a casual purchaser of their product . buyer beware and get the new specs before you buy a product you think you know and can rely on . you can '' t. if you are a land 's end or ll bean customer - call them and complain . they 've done this in the past , then had to bring back the `` old '' version . so , it was n't broke land 's end was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants ) so whose dim-bulb idea was it to `` fix '' them ? ? ? ?
1	the disney cars shoes were awesome for my grandson . he loved the racing lights and the wheels on the sides . they are somewhat tight because of the elestic on the insides , but they were a big hit for him .
0	i ordered this product for a friend 's bday since i got these same boots and loved them . i waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them . except it never happened . i was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago , i call amazon and they tell me to call macys . i call macys and they tell me to call amazon . i 've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail . then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it 's been backordered and that aerosoles cancelled the order . although now i 've told my friend she 's getting these boots and now she 's not . i 've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my life trying to get this resolved . do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w/ aerosoles . i will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again . worst customer service ever and i am sooooo pissed right now
0	can not order these as they do not say what small , medium or large= ... .i have a 6 year olde and is 60 # 's so do i buy a medium or a large ... i hate this when i want something and there is not enough information..
0	i wish i did not order this one . the picture looks nice but when i got it today , i really got disappointed . when you look at it closer , the wood beads , sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking . i wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads .
0	size 9.5 fit like it was an 8 . i wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in , and was unable to walk in them at all without pain . i 've bought steve madden before many times and know they run slightly small , but this pair was ridiculously small and i suspect perhaps mis-labeled
1	my online shoe shopping tip : buy a half size bigger than your normal size . if it 's a little too big , you can always add inserts to achieve a better fit . i also search the web for additional consumer reviews . pros : this pointy toed boot looks really sexy - a great bargain for 30 bucks ! it 's an easy to put on short boot . ( it goes up to the bottom of my calf - i 'm 5'5 ) the leather is shiney and has a seamless look . stains will wipe right off . i 'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young professionals to wear with their slacks . relatively comfortable . i personally would n't wear them all day long . cons : leather is stiff . does n't really bend with the leg when walking . i think that is what the previous negative review was referring to . the inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather . the zipper is not the best quality . hope this helps you make a better shopping decision ! * or , you can always buy , try on and return . if you choose the free shipping method and you want to return the item , you just have to go to the returns section of the website and generate a return label . once amazon receives it and processes it , they will give you your refund minus the shipping cost you saved when selecting `` free shipping '' . ( it is usually less than 5 bucks and you can see the amount in `` your account ) enjoy
1	i love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that ca n't be worn with a bra ... but the nipple issue was quite vexing . i did n't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion ... the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply . but , problem solved . these things rock
1	i am very pleased with the soft briefcase i purchased . it is so much easier to handle than a hard one . i would purchase another item from the same manufactuer if i need something else
1	dont buy it from andrew christian , i wrote them online several times and never , not once , got an answer from them , i ended up buying them some other place
1	i found it very comfortable with good fitting . i bought 4 pairs in last 3 and half years and this one was the best . i gave it 5 stars based on comparing with other brands that i bought . overall quality is good .
1	my only reason for not giving it a 5 star is because there i no elasticated bottom cuff otherwise great gym pant
0	i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old . luvable friend 's onsies are awful . the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies . and the velcro does n't even stick . they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes . also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old . lastly even the shirt tag stinks . it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son . shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review !
0	the item that is pictured is the item that i wanted and ordered . however , the item that is described and that i received ( halfpant ) , is not what is pictured . what is pictured is a hi-cut pant . i did not realize this until i received the order , and was greatly disappointed . i had to send everything back . you are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item . i actually would give this 0 stars , but the computer would not allow that .
1	great buy for 20 bucks . they look nice and fit well . they are distressed but it is not as bad as i thought it would be from reading the other reviews . they look nice with jeans and a dark shirt . pretty comfy too
0	i could n't believe it ! ! my son opened the box of shoes to find the shoes came with no laces ! ! he was so upset that he was n't able to wear them right away , because it was dec. 24 everything was already closed and nothing would be open until dec. 26 , and why should we have to pay for shoe laces ? ? ? i 'm glad you sent me the e mail , because i 'd like to send the shoes back ! ! we were able to find a brand new pair ( with laces ) at a better price .
0	i am not leaking so i do n't need those annoying papery pads , but i would still like a little padded protection , so i was hoping this bra would do the trick . well , it served that purpose alright , but it was a pain as far as nursing went . the clasp was difficult to release with one hand . the cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult . worst of all , the underwire gave me a rash ! this bra may work for some , but not for me..
1	does the job as described . recommend this brand . downst fall apart or rip after a couple of wears
0	these were a gift at christmas , and were a deep burgundy color . they do appear to be well stitched . however , after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading , and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore . the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !
1	i own lots of shoes ... but i do n't wear them ... truth be told , i detest having things on my feet . i somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way , my spirit ... my soul is also being somthered . but if i am in a suituation where i have to have something on my feet , i reach for my `` birks '' . now if you have never owned a pair , you are to still call them birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them birks . birks are a sacred thing , and we ca n't just allow anyone to call them `` birks '' now , can we ? if we did , there would be total anarchy . i own three pairs of this particular model . they are all the same color and i get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same ? well , i would . i have my grubby pair that i wear when i 'm at the beach and i do n't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if i happen to go look in the tidepools and such , i have my casual pair that i wear to barbecues and church ... yeah , i wear sandals to church ... what about it ? jesus did ... and then i have my nice pair that i wear to work and events where i do n't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that i 'm wearing sandals ... she still is , but in my mind i 'm justifying the fact because i 'm wearing the `` nice ones '' . in fact , my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it 's appropriate to wear sandals and if it is n't , i really do n't want to eat there . dang elitists . i 'm thinking of getting another pair . will i throw out the oldest pair ? no . you do n't throw out the mona lisa cuz it 's old , do you ? it is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of birkenstocks . are they pricey ? yeah , sure ... a lot more pricey than those fakenstocks you 're wearing , but they 'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer . so get a pair today ... get two pairs ... heck , get three pairs ... and no , i am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way . i firmly believe that when your feet are happy , you 're happy . so bless your soles with a gift from the gods . you 'll be glad you did .
1	these trunks are great . the pouch in the front works great in keeping everything together and comfortable . i drive alot , and these are by far the best underwear i have ever had . just be sure to order one size larger than you usually wear , otherwise they will be skin tight ( unless you want that )
0	when i ordered this skort the description did n't say that it was a childs size . so i complained to the site that i bought it from . i asked that my shipping also be returned because they did n't specify that this was a childs size . i wasted my money on shipping for an item i would n't have ordered if i had known it was n't an adult sized item . they did n't return my shipping
1	this is a lovely , lovely bra . it supports , lifts , and minimizes , creating a flattering shape underneath clothing . the wide straps are gentle on the shoulders , leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear . the back does n't ride up , and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor . the plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt , and dare i say it , looks pretty sexy . yes , you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye , st. olga
1	our son was very pleased to get a leather jacket for christmas . the proof is in the wearing ! he 's been wearing it ever since . thanks for the great transaction !
1	color and image are delightful . i do wish i had gone up a size as i like to wear it with a long sleeved t-shirt underneath
1	love this kept couture toiletry kit . i actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends . the bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel . it keeps the leaky goods all inside - wo n't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase . and , it 's a perfect size . it can hold about 10 days ' worth of toiletries .
1	the product was delivered in a timely manner and is a good quality product
1	please note , i did not find the need to order up many sizes . i only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly . nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction , nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back . i loves these boots and at a great price too . fast efficent shipping as well . i should say that i bought a pair of white mountain suede shearling boots and i was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality
1	i love naughty monkey ! i 'm so happy with their shoes ! they do n't hurt my feet
1	this was a long over due replacement for the dopp kit that was given to me when i left for vietnam . its changed very little and is still of fine quality . i expect it will provide all the use i 'll ever need
1	after i tired jockey no line promise hip brief , i will never purchased anything els
1	the shoes are comfy and of great quality . i was n't sure if i liked the buckle , but decided to risk it b/c of the great price . the buckle is a nice accent and overall i 'm am very happy with the shoes .
0	do not waist your money on this item ! it looks so unnatural . the padding is only on the side of the butt cheeks , doesnt cover the whole butt so you can definitly detect the padding . i was so disapointed when i tried it on .
1	my wife used this to get a better fit into her wedding gown . in retrospect , she wonders if it would 've worked even better if she had worn a traditional strapless bra over the shape and size bra
0	i purchased this expecting a high quality satin robe , but what i received was a run of the mil polyester robe . yes , it is shiny , but it feel like plastic . sadly , this will be returned
0	first time i 've ordered a product from leg avenue - and it 'll probably be my last ! i opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 `` runs '' in one of the legs before i even tried them on . what a waste of money ... and if i would pay to ship them back for another pair then i 've already put way too much money into , what should be , an inexpensive product
1	i purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas . i was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots . with four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when i saw these at a more reasonable price , i got them . when she opened them , she at first did n't even realize they were n't the ugg 's . she has been wearing them since and i 'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost . in comparison to the more expensive boots , she says `` no difference ''
1	i love my cayman crocs . my sister swore by these shoes , but i was n't convinced because they are a little different looking . i liked the bright colors i saw some people wearing at the beach this summer , but i 'm practical and they can only go with so many things . i ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything . i 'm not at all disappointed . they really do n't look bad paired with casual outfits . i wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it 's amazing . it 's not so much that you slip them on and say `` wow this feels great '' ... for me it was more so that after activities ( marathon shopping trips for example ) my feet were n't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit . i think they are great ... even with the `` different '' look ... though i do wish they 'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point
0	i was very dissappointed by this item . it arrived folded into a 6x6 square bag and was very creased when opened . it will take considerable pressing to try and get it out . the fabric is too stiff and does n't drap well . the length is n't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap . the return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk
1	the boot is great but it does run a wee bit large , if between sizes , go down not up if you want a closer to real fit . they are fun and do the job well
1	pros they do n't hurt the back of your heels comfortable like walking with socks on cons very thin , you can see your toes thru the fabric on the top . bottom line , they are a good buy for the price . very cute , stylish , and comfortable
1	the shoes are awesome ... my daughter loves them ! business was done in a professional manner and was an easy transaction
0	i was so disappointed in this product . i bought the ad hook , line , and sinker , thinking that the memory foam was a great idea , that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief . after about 2 hrs of wear , the foam is completely flat , which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard . save your money ! these are awful
0	this order was most unsatisfactory . i received the shoes with the security device attached . i had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached . i have yet to receive them . i would advise customers to avoid orders
0	the sleeves are long and the shirt is short . i dont know about others but that is not how i like my clothes ... . wont look to good with low rise jeans ! at least not with my average body . i dont weight 95 pounds
1	my mother is an avid world traveler and is quite particular about how she travels . so , i bought her the cabin cuddler for her birthday and she loves it ! and i quote `` it is practical and functional and makes a huge difference ( re : comfort ) for those long international flights . '' big hit !
1	i got 3 sets of these boxers not knowing much about the quality , fitting , material , etc ... all i have to say is these are well worth for the price
0	my daughter bought these herself , because she could n't afford the real birky 's . she bought them in august 2006 , now november 18 , 2006 the soles are worn out and the buckle just broke yeaterday . wasted pair of shoes . anyone have any ideas for good affordable shoes similar to birkys ? ? pat- mother of msu college freshman
0	i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old . luvable friend 's onsies are awful . the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies . and the velcro does n't even stick . they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes . also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old . lastly even the shirt tag stinks . it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son . shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review !
1	they look nice and feel amazing . i bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more . they 're great and the cushion does n't 'flatten out ' in the wash
1	these shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute ! i wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week . turns out jessica makes pretty good shoes ... ... ... cute ! ! !
0	the collar stays work as the ad indicates they will . they are organized and packaged well . the sizes provided accomodate all collars
1	i recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended asics shoes to me . this is my first pair of running shoes and i am very pleased with it . the shoes were very comfortable from the day one . one comment that i have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front . i have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe . i worked out fine for me , however , because i had purchased 1/2 size longer than what i usually wear . overall , i am very happy with this pair and would recommend it
0	order placed by 7th of july did n't arrived by now . no sunglasses ... no money ... no response from the seller ... the most awfull seller i have ever co-operated with ... . i wish i would not ordered this nice glasses from this dishonourable seller ... . think twice before placing an order paying money..
0	the sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body . my husband is 6 ' 178 pounds , so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit , but this one looked like a stiff kite on him . be aware the items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money , and only after i had filed a complaint with amazon . amazon acted quickly to post the credit
0	we bought this for our teenage son . the handling of the shipping was prompt , that is the only good thing i can say about the coat . i will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality , almost felt-like . the item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box , looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school ! i am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat . if it was not so cold , i would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing ! the item pills making it look really shabby . no reports of seams ripped , buttons lost , or holes in the pocket , however , he may be worried that if he tells me about those things i will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money . it was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself , so imagine his disappointment ! i expected much more of the coat than i got , and i am looking for a replacement
1	robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use . they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off ! we 've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off , but not these . its worth it to spend the extra $ $ on these shoes . and they 're so well made they 'll last for baby # 2
0	you have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit properly . they only fit properly for one wearing , stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry . i have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought i would try these . `` you get what you pay for '' applies to this product
1	this set is guaranteed to make your partner stop and take notice ! plus , you will enjoy wearing this silky , sensuous set to liven up your evening . the fit is fantastic . not much is left to the imagination
0	the shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet . the sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance . i have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all .
1	i love this jacket . it is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather . it is also long enough to cover my rear . very good in the rain , too
1	my new shoe wallet is even better than i expected ! it securely fastens to my running shoe ; holds my key , emergency cash , and identification ; and most importantly , serves as a safe place for my ipod sport sensor . best of all , my ipod works efficiently and accurately in the shoe wallet without my purchasing nike-branded shoes . i 'm a very happy consumer !
1	mom was looking for a similar item , from `` bass '' . i told her this brand was very reliable . she can put them down
1	these socks are really comfortable and they really stay up ! all other brands of over-the-calf socks that i have tried wo n't stay over-the calf . within a few hours , other socks are sitting on my shins . i have worn pairs of the gold toe over the calf athletic sock for up to 24 hours and the most they slid down my leg was about an inch . great socks
0	does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only . supplier does not carry the wide ones . birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths . not here . no exchange possible . now i 'm stuck with shoes that do n't fit and midwest sports could n't care less . i wo n't ever order from them again
1	good looking kicks if your kickin it old school like me . and comfortable . and relatively cheap . i 'll always keep a pair of stan smith 's around for weekends
0	it was advertised and not in stock so i was unable to get it
0	i bought these boots for my husbamd . he only had them less than one week and the soles were breaking down . i will never purchase them again ... .
1	for the price , these bags can not be beat ! there are n't terribly large , but they are just the right size to fit the goodies that i purchased for my girls . i am having them personalized and they will be ready to give
0	i ordered this to go under my halloween costume nine days in advance , and it arrived too late for me to wear it . it 's still in the package in my closet . maybe next year..
1	this is just the perfect accessory for the cats costume one of my dancers is using for our dance recital . got this in gray and brown too ! took a while for the product to get here . in fact , i had to re-order because of the delay -- but when finally the product arrived , it was worth the wait
0	did n't like these . infact theyre so ugly i havent even tried them o
1	i regained my sanity after getting these . sooooo much nicer than disposables
0	i purchased these sox for my husband who has parkinson 's disease , and has trouble putting on sox . ( the disease has limited his finger dexterity . ) the sox came in a package of six pair . i opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet . it was difficult as the sox did not stretch . at the end of the day i had to help him take them off . after washing them i found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all . i looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack i could not do so . i ended up giving them to a charity . this is the only time amazon has disappointed me . i decided to only use amazon for books , not other products .
0	these shoes are cute but 1 ) they are made wide 2 ) the heel is a little bigger than 2 '' 3 ) they are uncomfortable to walk in . i think i could find a better pair at wal-mart if i had to . the company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a big two thumbs down for that
0	this garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men . if you just want underwear look on ; however , if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less . at is unless the view is everythin
0	i never recieved the product . the order was cancelled by the sende
0	big for the size advertised , not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals . hoped it would shrink , since i 'm a perfect 6 , and it did n't . disappointed
1	your company was a pleasure to work with- thanks ! i will enjoy wearing the swimsuit that i ordered
1	great product -- just what i was looking for . service was excellent and shipping was prompt . thank you , thank you , thank you
0	bought these to keep the toes warm will riding my motocycle in the cold weather - worthless - no heat detected - you really feel the bulky wire if you do n't put them on exactly right - heavy d-cell draws down the sock on your leg - do n't bother , put the extra 25 bucks into your boots
1	bought these for my 7 year old per his request . the size was right , the style was right and he has been wearing them everyday since . they arrived quicker than anticipated and we are very happy with the purchase
0	i ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and i had the same problem with the turpentine smell . i was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price . i wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem . i washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink . i 'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they do n't make my other clothes smell , and i 'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them .
0	i ordered this product from general_discounters and i have tried for 4 wks . and still i have not gotten a response from them and i havent received my order . as far as the actual cologne , it is nice but order it from that company and you 'll not get to smell it because you wont get it . all other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller
0	i purchased 3 different embassy purses last december . none of them were the quality i had hoped for , and none were used as the gifts they were intended for . in this case , the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used . i would not buy from this company again
1	i 'm very happy with this tote bag . it 's huge and sturdy . i 've been using it to bring books and files to and from school for marking . quite a number of my colleagues like it , too
1	these sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and i just bought another one in a different color . they feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed napoletana designer , ermenegildo zegna . but , as a general rule when buying italian clothing , *always* buy them bigger than you would expect . i normally wear a size large shirt in the us , never xl . i am 5'7 '' and 185 lbs . i bought a size 54 ( x-large ) and it is comfortably roomy , and not too `` huggy '' on the fat . i think some of the similar sweaters from zegna are more `` delicate '' ( read : see-through ) . this one is a little thicker , but still thin for a sweater . i *really* like wearing it with a t-shirt underneath , feeling the soft cashmere on your arms .
0	the footbed on these clogs is very comfortable , but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily ( in my case , after two wearings ) the seller 's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside , they wo n't take them back . i had to sew the buckles back on . in my opinion , $ 100 shoes should n't need to be repaired after two wearings . the suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color , but not what i expected when i ordered
1	this is the best of the small front pocket wallets available . other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that do n't work well . this is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet , only reduced to 4x3 inches . holds three cards , bills , and id as well as having a little room under the id card for business cards . great buy
0	awful fit ! i usually love wacoal petites because they are generally a perfect fit for me , however , the mesh on this one is terrible because it rolls . at first i thought it was the size so i purchased another and found the same issue . steer clear of this model
1	i do roofing work work outside on the hotest days . i had problems with heat rash jock itch . my boss suggested i wear loose fitting all cotton boxers like most of the crew . i asked around picked up some hanes all cotton boxes . wow - what a difference -- they feel great . no binding when i work - the cotton does give a bit as you wear them . now they are the only underwear i will wear . they do shrink a bit after washing - so do get a size up
1	i read the reviews and alot of people said they run 1 to 2 sizes to big . so i always wear a eight and i ordered a 9 . they were huge on me . i sold them to a friend . also the ankle part was really wide for my foot when it was in the boot . i 'll stick to my ugg 's
0	the robe does not fit me . i wanted to return it , got a return item number , got busy , and did not get it in the mail soon enough . they have a strict 30 day return ploicy . nordstroms does not do this . i could exchange it there . sorry i got a job and not time for petty rules . i will go elsewhere next time
1	this is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels i have in my closet . great buy good pric
0	i only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute . other than that they were quite unusable . i usually wear a size 7 but i could not even get my foot into these shoes ... and they are quite hard . had to get rid of them
0	this is a beautiful dress but it would not fit me , or most people i know . 36 '' bust , 33 '' waist and 41 '' hip ? fat fat fat ! what about us tall slim people
1	my husband is a big man and very rough on belts . most belts last him a few weeks . this one has lasted him 3+ years . the only reason i 'm buying him a new one is because he 's lost so much weight . there 's still 'lots of miles ' left in the belt i 'm replacing . definitely got our money 's worth out of it
1	it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly ... i want to get more ... thank
0	not happy at all with these slippers . do not buy them . they lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot .
1	i bought these for my husband , and he loves them . the material is soft and comfortable , and they keep his feet warm . they are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers . he wears 11 1/2 wide , so i got him the xl pair , and they fit him well
0	the writing was peeling off this badly . i ca n't let me child wear this . i threw it out
0	paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - never again
1	i had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders , and would support my breast . this one did both . this bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline . i was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped . the key is to get a propper fit . i went from a 38c to a 34dd not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra . if you can pull the band more than an inch from your body , you are wearing the wrong bra size . it is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place . it takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight , but i do n't bounce , jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore . i bought two in september 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in october 05 , and when these wear out i will purchase the exact same thing . i hand wash ( or machine wash on delicate ) after each wearing with a lingerie soap , and line dry . they still look band new . i was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting , with the band being so snug , but they are still holding `` it all '' together . i was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but i have n't had any tears , rips , runs or poked through any of them yet
0	so cheap , the seams were n't sewn up all the way . am returning
0	i loved the bathing suit the first time i laid eyes on it so i purchased it . i 'm actually small but i do have thick thighs so i got a medium . but when it was delivered and i tried it on , it was too small ! i should have gotten a large . the medium made me look like i had these big love handles . so please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger . but other than that the bathing suit is great . i 'm just going to have to loose the love handles
1	my hubby liked this shirt -it was a great christmas present
0	i agree with what others have said about the re-designed sport knit pants . i had been happily buying the tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when lands end decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead , presumably because some customers had requested the newer look . maybe i 'm wrong , but i think most people who are looking for the latest fashion are n't going to suddenly start shopping at lands end . and it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style , the company should make a new , additional product in that style , rather than re-design a product which , according to lands end 's own descriptions , was a perennial customer favorite . i returned the new pants and this formerly loyal lands end customer is now shopping elsewhere
0	i received this item as a gift and was disappointed when i pulled it out of the box . it 's okay , but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem . the beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo , but are rather cheap looking . it looks like something i could make myself . very cheap and plain looking .
0	i am sorry but i did not like it nor will i wear it as it is too big looks funny on me . i wish i had not have gotten it .
1	these boots are comfortable but they do n't keep my feet very warm in cold weather . they have an unusual pattern that gets a lot of compliments and goes with almost every color in a wardrobe . the heel height is perfect . also , i can tuck my jeans into the boots - an added bonus
0	amazon did n't tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly were n't what i expected . i was expecting something a bit more durable ... the first night i tried to sleep in these , they ripped in the back . the immitation-satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together . but i ca n't give them 1 star because they are just as cute as they look !
1	i get compliments every time i wear this . i took a chance , because i tend to be a bit plump . as other reviewers noted , the sleeves do run snug . but otherwise it 's a great jacket at a great price . the grommets are just so fun.it is fully lined . i just love this modern addition , and it 's not too `` young '' feeling , just right .
1	the shoes are not exactly what i wanted bacause i was trying to get the same shoe that i had purchased some years ago . times change and so does style . i searched everywhere and these were the closest to what i wanted . the keds shoes from amazon which i ordered and received on time might i add , were more like what we used to call bo bos and the rhyme used to go like this ... .. `` bo bos they make your feet feel fine , bo bos they cost a dollar 99 , bo bos . '' do n't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing . i ca n't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference . i still like the older ones better . not sure if i 'll ever find the same ones again . oh and one last thing , if i could give shoe and clothing stores one tip , it would be to make adult sizes for the children 's items . they make some really cool things for kids today . like the keds girls ' jazzy sneaker . hope it 's not just because i have n't grown up yet
0	i ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from diane 's little lambs . i specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf ( were shorter , fuller , etc ) . but the boots that arrived were taller , even the color was not the same as on the website . i emailed the vendor , never got a reply . so i went to the website to get instructions on mailing the boots back .
0	i ordered this items in size xx-large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge . maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5 , although she looks normaly for her age
0	this is a nice looking wallet , but the internal design leaves something to be desired . there is an internal flap used for credit cards , etc , that makes the wallet too thick - even if you do n't fill it with cards . i am tempted to cut it out ( it is stitched to the inside ) to make the wallet less cumbersome . the credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards . there is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed ( it is also in a tight slot )
1	i bought this product online about a week ago and it is exactly as described . and to the reviewer who backpacks : if your that hardcore of a backpacker , you might want to consider spending more than $ 6 on a fanny pack . seriously , lighten up and review the product , not tell your life story
1	my husband bought me these for christmas and i have had more compliments on these ! ! the flare styling and laces set them off
0	i ordered `` classic '' jockey breif , which i currently own , but the new units received are approximately 2 '' taller on each side when compared to my current briefs , both labeled jockey classic . ? ?
0	i just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs ( from another online company ) and was very disappointed . i picked dickies because they were cute , cheaper than most , and seemed like they would last . the colors are really nice , but the light pastel colors are almost see-through . i tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs . the ankles are tapered , not obnoxiously so , but definitely tapered . the medium bottoms have a huge amount of extra fabric in the belly . the fabric is rough , and feels like plastic
0	i bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion , however , the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it does n't seem to go with anything including jeans . the comfort level is ok , not spectacular . in reality i do n't think this shoe lives up to the steve madden name . i ca n't recommend this shoe
0	very cute but have a funky balance , wobly and on the verge of falling over . not comftorable . poorly designe
1	i love these pants ! ! ! ! i 'm a first time boarder and i was n't cold at all ! ! ! deffinately a great buy
0	i 'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received , but the case i received does n't cut it for the 60gb . it fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them . i do not recommend this product for the 60gb . i suppose we zen 60gb owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players
1	very good quality , nice leather , sturdy , and can be used for anything . big enough as a book bag , great carry on , a purse ... etc . i am very satisfied with my purchase ... .the bag is made in the states , and a great price , for a quality made item . i highly recommend this leather bag
0	i bought these socks to wear for work . they did n't even last one day . by the end of the first day , there was a hole in one of the socks at my heal . by the end of the week both socks had quarter sized holes at the heels . i bought three pairs so i tossed out the first pair . the next week i put on a new pair of socks , and once again by the end of the day there was a quarter sized hole in one of the heels .
1	what can i say , these are pretty and practical . i know my boyfriend is going to be impressed , after the shock wears off . i like these panties , i like the lacy look , so divine , and i like the way they ride pretty low . and they do n't show through your clothes . like my dear gal pal ophella , i can imagine a naughty situation or two where i could have a little illicit and harmless fun . yikes ! what am i saying
1	this is an excellent bra . in addition to being sexy , it is also quite functional . it defines one 's individual breast shape well and it offers maximum support . this particular bra comes in a pretty peach color and a beautiful black . chantelle bras are made according to french standards . you get a somewhat larger cup and the band size is not as long . still , it 's an excellent bra
1	i got this shirt when it was on sale for $ 10 so i snatched it up quickly . i like the shirt a lot . it is very pretty on . order the size that you normally wear . i made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a medium . the shirt is way to big . so maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt .
1	when i play basketball , or in the past when i did jiu-jitsu then too . anyway , they keep me warm and tight like a brace in the way that so my muscels do n't pull or cramp . anyway , i guess they look o.k . too , but who would see them anyway ... they 're underwear ! ! ! ! take care and good luck
1	have spent years looking for a bra that feels good , does what it 's supposed to and did n't make you wish you could get home slip out of something so uncomfortable ... at last i think i 'm at the end of my search . very comfortable , great support and can go hours before i start thinking about jammies . only thing that would make this bra better would be padded straps
0	so i just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks ... .what a dissapointment . i open the box and immediately i see what appears to be a defect . the inside of the shoe ( like on your right foot , the left side , not the right ) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area , including smudging on the asics logo . this was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged . also , the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe . poorly done , last time i will ever buy asics shoes again
0	while the suit fits and looks great , my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit . it 's really the placement that bothered her . there is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam , which from a distance , looks like one had an accident in their trunks . thanks , but no thanks . these shorts are being returned
1	i picked this sucker up for $ 30 from fred meyer , after they made it clear that they had no other options available for charging my ipod from my computer ( i was on vacation with no cord and a dead battery ) . i was only expecting it to last throughout the vacation , but i 've been using it ever since . i keep the car charger in my car , with no extra cables to burden it , and i keep the wall charger plugged into the wall . the cable retracts easily , with a design much like that of a window blind ( pull until you let go , where it locks , and then pull a bit more and let go to release ) . it 's a small , unobtrusive , and incredibly convenient device for your ipod , and at this price , it 's a steal . you 'd pay two or three times this at some electronics stores for the wall charger or car charger alone , let alone one that is so solidly constructed . no question -- if you own an ipod , purchase this product . i was impressed enough to come and write this review -- perhaps you will be too
0	i ordered two bras and both were defective . the left side strap had been sewn twisted and there was no way to correct without cutting and resewing
1	this product is what i expected when i buy a carhartt product . it 's a quality item and worth the money i spent
1	i love these shoes ! ! ! ! ! they are so comfortable and you can buy them for a great price.i have them in gold and im really happy with my purchase
1	these are by far my favourite yoga pants . very flattering for practically every sort of figure -- but more than that they 're super comfy . so stretchy that they feel like a second skin . and the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you 're self-conscious about your belly . plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your t-shirt riding up . and sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you 're good to go back on the street ! the biggest problem with these pants is that it 's hard to want to wear anything else . i own some 4 pairs of these and love them
0	we could not use these shoes . the tongues on these shoes are too short and we had to force them on . they were even a 1/2 size larger than our grandson wore . it was a big disappointment and waste of money . save your receit
0	per the description , it sounded like these would fit snug . well , they fit too snug , feeling very cramped . i have a 33 inch waist , and ordered the 32/34 waist . i 'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton . this was the first time that i 've got polyester boxer briefs . unless you like 'um really tight , you might want to go to the next size up , or just get cotton briefs . i 'm throwing these away
1	i love this product , and the rest of the pack-it system , beyond all reason . i 've given them as gifts repeatedly . in effect , they give you `` drawers '' in your suitcase , and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers . it 's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else . the 18 '' folder works well for womens ' shirts , blouses , and slacks . i can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it . if you want to carry more or fewer pieces , it 's forgiving . i use it for suit jackets too , folding them in across the width of the folder . i 've used mine often over perhaps 8 years , and they still look like new . a standard-sized 21 '' roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold : 1 18-inch folder ( this product ) , two full-sized pack-it cubes , a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers , a toiletries bag ( not from this sytem ) and a pair of shoes ( squeezed ) . it also works to omit the cubes and use two 18 '' folders , depending on the clothes being packed .
0	i 've been buying these t-shirts for 20 years without issues . about 9 months ago , calvin klein changed the manufacturer . these t-shirts are nothing but crap now ! they are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be , and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads . the price has n't gone down.. just the quality . please do n't get ripped off ... do not buy these shirts . here is another case of american immorality at it 's best . let 's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours
1	once while traveling , i had a big blister on my heel and needed something that would n't rub my heel . i happened to get a pair of crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front . i was pleasantly surprised by the crocs - very cushiony soft , like walking on air . also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet do n't get sweaty either . i originally got the crocs for temporary use but now i look forward to slipping into them everyday when i get home . it 's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step . they 've replaced my slippers , mocassins , surf shoes and sandals .
0	the pads inside the bra fall out every time you wash it .
0	i must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable . you also do not notice anything `` irregular '' . however , i ordered these to use as boxers -- that is to wear them around the house . not a good plan . these are very thin , plus the fly is very narrow . all in all , not very useful for my intended purpose
1	these are hands down my favorite pair of jeans . i 'm 5'5 '' and they are just the right length to wear with tennis shoes and midheight heels . the stretch fabric hugs in all the right places , and the cut is slimming .
1	it 's golden color is very remarkable ..it looks like real gold..wonderful piece to have
0	we had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair . the idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing . my daughter was excited when she opened the box and she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice . the problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair . the directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair . well , we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs . none of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads . she has very long hair with a lot of wave so i guess if you had short , straight hair , this product would be fine for you
1	most flattering yoga pants i 've ever worn . i have an akward figure , long waist , big butt , a little pot belly , but these pants look and feel great . plus , i 've heard the company pays a living wage to thier workers . i want 10 pairs
1	good quality product at very reasonable price . postage was quick even though i 'm in the uk . all round good service
0	the tie does have gorgeous color to it , but when the description says `` good quality '' its a little off base .
0	i was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings . i have purchased leg avenue before and found them to be excellent , however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone 's truck brand . as a matter of fact i 've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings ! leg avenue is now off my list ! of course , if they priced them three for a dollar , now that might be worth the price
1	i love these bras so much ! they are so comfortable , any other bra i wear now feels weird . the only thing i noticed was the lacy edging started bubbling after about two months of washing and drying , otherwise their my very favorite bras
1	a great shoe ! i was very impressed with the softeness of the leather , immediate comfort and versatility of this shoe . this is definitely a well made , year 'round slide . if you are looking for a classic loafer ; this is your shoe .
0	the shirt fits well , good style , good shirt . but bealls of florida sucks as a retailer . their customer service is rude , crude , and unrefined . even the supervisors of customer service suck , they do n't return or accept any items back . so beware , you better be damn sure that size fits ( ordered product before ) . because bealls of florida will not let you return the item for different size or style . i will not shop here again ! i repeat , i will not shop here again . this place sucks as far as a retailer
0	i am sorry but i did not like it nor will i wear it as it is too big looks funny on me . i wish i had not have gotten it .
0	although very cute , crocs are not good shoes . they are a cheap , plastic shoe that is over priced and not comfortable at all . i bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are `` non slip '' . she did slip in them , many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet . they are the right size but i just think they are not made well . do n't go for the hype . they are a useless shoe .
0	look closely at the picture of the `` white '' top . it actually has red around the top and on the straps . to those of us who do n't want ugly red zig-zag thread ... ... .
0	never got to wear this lingerie at all . mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back . sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card . sent another email to emphasise that i requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back ... very very bad servic
0	this set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric ! there is no shape to the gown ... awful
1	the skin fits well the belt clip works well . it seems a bit bulkier than my friend 's zen skin belt clip ... but she paid about $ 10 more than i did ! i would definitely recommend this product . i have yet to use the armband so i ca n't review that right now . my only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin , not zen screen . so the screen protector is smaller than the zen screen . the window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen , but that part only tells the time anyway
0	these were a gift at christmas , and were a deep burgundy color . they do appear to be well stitched . however , after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading , and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost do n't look like a match anymore . the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much !
1	i purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price . as soon as i received it and wore it twice i went back and purchased three more . the weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and i suspect will give it a long life . after multiple ( 10+ ) washings , the first one i purchased still feels as good as the newer ones . the colors are warm . i would suspect that this shirt would cost $ 10-15 . as long as the price stays below $ 10 , i will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt . as for the comment that these fit smaller than most , i did n't have that experience . in nike , reebok , gap , and rusell athletic tshirts , i wear a large . i wear a large in artiga as well , and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing
0	slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed . construction was cheap , goose fill was light and overall flimsy . if you want to wear it twice , then thats what its worth
1	they are a great quality , comfortable boot . and the price was far less than local stores . the shipping at regular rate took over a week , though
0	i wish there were 0 star . although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them . after searching a lot for buying a present for my sister 's birthday , i found this sandal and i decided to buy . i ordered it on march 9th and after 20 days ! ! , still i have n't received them ! ! ! ! ! ! i am getting my money back . not only i have wasted my time but also i should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late ! ! ! ! conclusion : these sandals are very beautiful but never fall for them .
1	i have really enjoyed my sunglasses . quick shipment and great price make this a must buy item . would buy from again
1	a difficult item to find in department stores . found some at twice the price in a leather goods store . the fossil leather key cases were of equal quality . i purchased two and am very satisfied
0	these pants were washed one time , following the washing instructions , they were not put in the dryer , and they shrunk not only around , but lengthwise . i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems . i look forward to your reply
1	these are wonderful sandals . tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail . finally did the right thing and went online . great sandals at a very reasonable price . you wo n't be sorry if you purchase these . very stylish and very comfortable
0	the 2 bras i ordered were they same style , it even said so on the labels attached , however , they both look and feel different . the white has a lot more padding , a rounder shape , and the lining is tearing away from the padding ( part of the design ) . the navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding ( which is what i wanted in the first place ) i was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had ... in addition , i had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen i was not informed that it would have to be backordered . not happy with my overall experience
1	spectacular item . wears well on a fine woman . my wife is short , and this item fit fine , especially since most one-size-fits-all lingerie is built too tall
0	i had got these for my husband for christmas . nice material , however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height , so we had to return it
1	bought one , loved it , bought another one for my d-i-l , she loved it , bought one for my daughter , she loved it ... ..you 're probably getting the picture now . i bought the next size up for each of us , and it 's wonderful with a shirt or light sweater underneath . oh , and did i mention the incredible price ? ?
0	i ordered a pair of scrubs for a friend to be sent to my p.o . box but the seller used ups which wo n't send packages to p.o . boxes so i gave an alternate address . i 've never recieved the scrubs for my friend . i 've sent e-mails inquiring about my order and have n't recieved any word back . i 've been cheated out of my money .
0	i still got a pantyline with this -- -strange and frustrating -- -- :
0	product was supposedly shipped 1-4-07 and still do not have i
1	these are absolutely the most fashionable and adorable shoes on earth . they are right on the mark . i love them so much that i am ordering my second pair..not because the first fell apart , but because i simply have to have more than one pair
1	trans . was great . love the shirt ! ! i know it 's a lot for a t-shirt , but i had to have it ! !
1	had to send back the first pair because i needed a bigger size . received the second pair and credit for the first pair promptly . this pair is just right ! ! ! will definately order again . thanks
1	now , i 'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be backpacks . i spent about two months searching for a new one until i finally came across this particular model . i 'll start with by saying that i love this damn thing . it has plenty of space , a whole bunch of extra cords that i suppose a hiker would use but i think just look nice , and its very durable ( which is a must for me since everything i own will take a beating ) . i 'm telling you straight from the horse 's mouth , this backpack is worth the money . now if it only came as an 18 slot..
0	these boots are very cute and comfortable . however they are not leather as stated in the description . they are clearly labeled all manmade materials on the inside of the boot . since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal , but the price i paid is not worth it for non-leather boots
0	save yourself the trouble and get the braided ( 3-line ) latex hose type of clothesline . want suction cups / rings / snap hooks , etc ? buy them for pennies at a drug store . the problem with this clothesline is that you ca n't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines -- they slide down to the lowest point in the middle . the only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they 'll dry is with a braided line , period .
1	i love these socks . they fit great ( my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles ) and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things . :
1	i purchased these shoes as a christmas gift for my husband . he 's been wearing it a lot . he says it 's comfortable , and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out . i was hoping it has more of a dressier look . it really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki 's
1	highly recommend shoe , but you might need a larger size than usual . i wear easy spirit 7 1/2 w but found this shoe too snug in both width and length , and had to return
0	i ca n't say much for the shoes , but amazon goofed up on this one . they shipped out an empty box . luckily ups caught it and sent notice to amazon for me .
1	got this for my teen as an alternative to a bathrobe . she loves it - nice warm , pretty pink color . they run small-she usually takes a medium -got her a large . she could have used an xl . sleeves are a bit short . she likes the look the zip front
0	perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe 's insert , but i hated it . it felt half-there . there was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front - like those `` orthotic '' deals that come on infomercials . well , it did n't feel good on my tender forefoot so i sent them back . on the other hand , the shoe looked great . i guess , if you really want it , shoe can go shopping for some dr. scholl 's
1	i absolutely love this suit , my only downfall is it runs big so order one size down
1	this item arrived on time and the quality was great . this bodysuit makes a great gift idea for `` baby '' - it 's just how i expected it would be
1	i purchased these slippers in pink , and not only are they super cute , they are quite comfortable and very warm . the sole of the slipper is slightly heavier than most , but it is nice if you need to step outside or in the garage for something when it 's cold out . i would recommend them . :
1	i love the look and they are very comfortable on my feet . i got the black and white , and i love them with a pair of capris or long shorts
0	i just found out that this shirt back-ordered after i was promised by amazon before i ordered it that i will receive this item before december 23 . i just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th , and i had purchased it on the 15th . this means i will not get it until after december 26th ! because i bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister , i was only able to give her pants without the shirt for christmas . she had to leave back across country , and i am forced to send this shirt to her . how embarressing ! obviously it is christmas time and if you 're going to have a storefront on amazon.com , you better get extra stock ! the worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on christmas and ruining a family member 's present . beware folks , you may not get this item when it says you will
0	i just got my pair of sandals.i regret i didnot read the customer review before buying . although very cute and trendy sandles , but are very uncomfortable
1	i do n't have a lot of experience with compression shorts , but i am very pleased with this product . the fabric does not lose compression over time ( although i 've only had them a short time ) . the fit is good , the fabric is comfortable . i 've gotten into the habit of sleeping in them , and they work great for keeping you toasty . i wish products like this were around during the years i played college soccer
0	i thought this case would be like the ipod cases i have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod ; it is not . the case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage . the belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand does n't work well . overall i would not recomend this product
0	i acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit . i even complimented her on them . i liked so much how they looked on her that i took the time to locate them online ( amazon ) . i ordered them with much anticipation that i would also look cute in them . needless to say , looks are deceiving . perhaps , they felt better on her than they did on me but i felt like i was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic . i was disappointed . if there 's nothing i 've learned being a woman in her mid-30s , i come to realize that there 's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes..
1	they call their socks the `` worlds softest men 's classic crew sock '' and let me tell you its the truth . been looking for a pair of red socks for weeks , with out success . they may not be the shade of red i wanted but they are the best in fit and quality . now find me the `` red shade '' i 'm looking for and i 'll be even more pleased . norb reynders ... ... .yes over 13 ... going on 7
0	these socks are advertised as seamless toe socks . they are very thin and they do have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe . not only does the seam press into the toe , but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself . terrible product
1	i purchased one of these cases for my sister-in-law , and she liked it so much , that i bought one for me too . i really like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a great carrying case for their ds lite . the vendor that shipped both of the cases did a great job of a quick shipment of a case that met all expectations . i would purchase from them again without hesitation
1	i pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running . i not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but i ran two half marathons and the nyc marathon with this exact sneaker . when they became worn from the wear and tear ? i bought another pair - exact one . these sneakers lasted me half a training season plus the marathon . not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles . i highly recommend them . and the color is fun , too
1	quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8/black . no complaints.. great service . great price
0	i have white everlast boxing shoes they are very comfortable i thought these ones were the same . the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing . the black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is . they do n't move well . plus they charged almost $ 20. for shipping . so i ended up paying a lot for them .
1	the fatigues were just what my son wanted . the only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order . i guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom . but my son did n't want that so i had to hem about four inches on each leg . other than that it was an excellent product
0	i have worn jockeys for almost 20 years , but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years . the fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly , and the underwear is , for some unfathomable reason , heavily perfumed ! i had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out . plus , some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight , and some was so loose i could n't wear them -- and they were all the same size . very inconsistent quality . i do not recommend these anymore
0	i have purchased ak in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed . the shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy . i would not recommend this shoe to anyone
1	my son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . they are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color
0	i purchased the dopp money clip and card holder for a specific vacation cruise . it is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed : one , it will only hold about six bills and two , it demagnetized my room key card twice over eight days . realizing this could also demagnetize my regular credit cards , i removed them from the card holder . i am reluctant to use the money clip again .
1	great purchase -- good price , easy . what more could you want
0	broke within 12 hours of purchase - very cumbersome and non-flexible for different types of cars . would n't recommend
1	my husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots . i also like the fact you can buy them in black and amazon had a fantastic price on them . i do n't know the wearability of the socks since i just got them for my husband for christmas . i bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay - no holes in the toes , yet ! overall , i think the socks are great .
1	agree 100 % , very comfy . besides making the ideal for everyday use , the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch . the look is very sexy . so they are good in both sides : comfy and sexy
0	super low price advertised on 'select sizes and colors ' . oh and u have to add to your cart before you know the price
0	i bought a pair of these calvin klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year . i found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable . i 'm large up front and i found the crotch area to be quite small and thin . the pouch is also to small . i am a briefs man myself , but these are not as comfortable as most briefs . i can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans . i would rather wear the calvin klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs . the trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me . if i had to choose only between these underwears or none at all , i would rather not wear any underwear at all
0	i have usually found jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time , which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled , no matter where you find them sold . however the last couple of their articles that i purchase through amazon , namely the pouch trunk underware , and `` a '' style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered . i wear a medium size ( 32 '' waist medium build ) and purchased the same in both products . and both of these products are `` painfully small '' after laundered . i tried to wear them anyway , hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on . but they were just uncomfortably too short , and tight . by the way , i laundered them in cold water , just like i do all my clothing
1	i where these shoes all the time . they are really comfortable to run in
1	these shoes keep my feet cozy all the way through a twelve hour shift , walking on concrete floors
0	the pants that i ordered for my size were very small . they were n't true to size at all . i would not recommend this item to anyone
0	my original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when i had to re-order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes , i was overcharged also had to pay shipping fees again . i tried several times to resolve this problem via amazon the shipping co. bealls florida , but was basically ignored never received my refund . i find this to be deceitful poor customer service
0	terrible bra . what i mistake i made thinking this would work out for me . terrible fit , not made for dd cups or for that matter anyone over a b cup ... . very disappointed ... .
0	really cute boots , but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they were n't supported , and about to slide out . the 4 '' heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and i had to take these off after half a day . my next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help
1	protects the vision m without restricting it 's use or synch connection . flip screen provides extra protection but does n't always stay in place . shipping took a little longer than expected ( more than a week ) but was reasonable
0	i 've had this coin purse not even 2 months now , and i 've only used it about 7 times . unfortunately , the zipper broke already ! i could n't believe it .
1	these are some very nice shoes . i love the blue and black ones . these really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes . they are also very comfortable . if you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price , get t-macs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	i bought two of these as a gift for my husband . he 'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed . these were ready to go right out of the box , no assembly required , took up less space in his closet than the 3-4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had , and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from . the cushioned tie `` hooks '' ensure the ties will not slip off , and also that they will not be damaged . a breeze to organize his vast tie collection . and he 's loving this product
1	i ordered this bra as well as the olga women 's perfect fit full figure , black , 38ddd . this bra provides much better lift , support and separation than the olga . i think it is because the cups are seamed . i 'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature ( i 'm 5'2 '' ) , and also has a large bra size ( i 'm a 36ddd ) .
1	this is my husband 's favorite shirt because it 's light and comfortable . it is my favorite shirt for him because it needs no ironing and always looks crisp and neat
1	this merchant really delivers with this item - in the stores , this is almost twice the price . i really was n't expecting such quality from this item ( yes , it 's crushed velvet , so not warm , but warm was n't the goal ) . would definitely recommend this item , and may buy another color for myself
1	these are the best windproof liner gloves out there . i freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because i thought they were made of gore windstopper and could n't find any that said `` made with gore windstopper '' but actually it 's polarguard windbloc . in any case , when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing . these are totally windproof . extremely compact , i do n't think you can make them any thinner than this . good price . the only `` downside '' is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet . this is true of any windproof glove so it 's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove . these weigh nothing ( probably about an ounce each ) and so i pack two or three pairs if i know i 'll be getting them wet . i wear these ice climbing , hiking , mountaineering , i have a pair i cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter , and i wear them skiing inside of my mittens . these really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time . i have n't had cold hands skiing for two seasons now , a problem that plagued me for years . i ca n't recommend these enough . -scott
0	i hate this bra . the elastic band is not soft and rolls up as the day wears on . shoulder straps are skinny inadequate . only good thing is that it is low-cut . i prefer my $ 12 nursing bras purchased at wal-mart . i only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut
0	my review appears to be inconsistent with the others . weeks after i received my jacket i had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places . this is not following heavy use , but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office . in addition , the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look . when considering the cost of the jacket , shipping and repairs , i should have to gone to macys and purchased a nicer jacket .
0	one shoe did not fit properly -- also did n't think the sole would be comfortable for all day walking
1	these shoes are different from anything else i have ever owned . i truely love wearing them . they are comfortable , practical and they make me smile every time i wear them ! order a 1/2 size larger than your usual size and have some fun
0	i got this for my newborn son and it 's so big- it fits my husband . i wish it said something in the ad about this ridiculously big infant hat ! !
1	the quality is much better than expected . i bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our las vegas trip sept. 6 , 2005 . we were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities , our cell phones , travelers checks , keys , and medicines in particular . we love the spacious divided compartments . i highly reccommend this product..
0	when this product came , it says `` girls '' - not a woman 's size . i 'm a petite woman 5'2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me - like a jr 's size or `` girls '' size as the tag states . now i have to spend $ $ sending this product back
1	one of the most comfortable bras i 've ever worn . i own several , and they 're just about all i 'll wear ! very nice fit , and good look under clothes
0	a red star ! ? ! ? i bet this wo n't sell well in eastern europe .
0	i bought a bunch of these shirts because i saw the good reviews . at first i was happy , they fit perfect , then i washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than i ever seen shirts shrink in my life . my medium shirts became xxs . i wish i had a 8 year old son , because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now
1	this polo is absolutely fabulous ! i love the length , it comes down to my hips . i bought it in the size i usually wear and it fits great ! i wore it under a little khaki jacket with jeans and it looked fantastic . i ca n't wait to buy it in every color
0	in theory this boot seemed perfect : added some height , came in perfectly wearable colors , was made of real leather , the price was unbeatable , but ( yes , unfortunately a big but ) like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . i did my research , read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . but still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins . i 'm a big `` shoe collector '' and i can recognize a design error when i see one . surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . these boots are not meant for walking . if you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill that purpose
0	these socks were thin , large , and horrible . they had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently . absolutely worthless
0	i expected this bag to be much more comfortable ... but i have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags . however , i do like all the compartments for organizing
0	i purchased this item judging by its comfort factor . all 's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place . the straps slip off occassionally , causing the shoes to come loose .
1	reef makes the best sandals , the price is pretty much set , no real savings here , but the selection is great . they may look like other sandals , but do n't be fooled ... they 're top notch
1	size was true . i just did not like the
0	paid for expedited delivery , and it showed up four days later then anticipated
1	stretches to fit you exactly . the smooth fabric holds everything in place . contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy . highly recommended
1	i like the flip case . it is exactly what i wanted . however , the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it .
1	rubber boots do n't have to look like booring rubber boots . i ordered women 's tan `` beach holiday '' boots for my daughter as a christmas present . they arrived in time for christmas and she loves them
1	this is a heavy/thick robe , i expect it would fit a man 6 ' tall perfectly . i am 5'8 '' and the sleeves are only slightly to long but , i do n't even notice now . the comfort level is amazing , this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed . i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but , you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel . i got the brown color and i love it , i feel like grisly adams in this thing..
0	shoes was not excalty the same as pic shown on web site it was kind of used..
0	these slippers are typical of daniel green products , beautiful , comfortable and affordable . thank
0	this luggage did not last for even one flight . it was torn in the corners and the handles were broken . i did contact the company and was given a full refund though
1	i really like these . i do recommend getting a size smaller . i normally wear and 8.5 and ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly . super comfortable !
1	this little scale can pay for itself many times over , and grants peace of mind as you approach check in . i purchased two , one for my australian friend who always overpacks and has to pay at the gate for overweight luggage . it is more accurate than bathroom scales . if you are by yourself , hold it in front of a mirror .
0	the garment i received was labeled large . in fact , at best it is a `` small '' . the material and workmanship was good but the product was simply mislabeled
0	it is a horrible item . if i could have given this hairagami a no star rating , i would have , and to think i wasted almost $ 20 for this junk . it snaps unexpectedly all the time , and always while you are twirling the hair . it totally tangles the hair . it is a nightmare to get out of your child 's hair . my oldest , 12 , really wanted this hairagami and was totally disappointed . she told all her friends not to buy it
1	this was just what i was looking for and could n't find in local retail stores . fits perfectly in my wallet and now my credit cards do n't fall on the ground in stores ! reasonable price also . excellent product
1	great fit , lightweight . these are very snug and allow for maximum mobility for quicker players who do a lot of cutting and fast movement . support strap is not too tight which is good , and actually serves a purpose
1	very comfortable , but the straps keep coming loose .
0	it was advertised and not in stock so i was unable to get it
1	my son really liked this , although i recommend that you check sizes exactly as i thought that a size l big kids would be big but it is just the right size for an 11 or 12 year old
1	quick shipping and a great product , i am looking forward to using it very soon
0	these were not as expected , there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels , there was just an open hole . he has problems using these too !
0	these shoes are not as cute as they appear , the heel is really 2.5 '' , the material is cheap , the fit is too wide , the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in , etc . etc . etc . on a positive note , it 's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress . be warned , the company claims that all their shoes have 2 '' heels when they do n't and they charge tax on shipping charges..
0	these shoes are hideous ! who would wear them ? they are so uncomfortable . they always give me blisters ! i hate these shoes . do not buy them unless you like getting blisters
1	good quality workmanship , very authentic looking and sizes are easy to fit . i would buy another one . robert
0	like all the haynes t-shirts except the 50/50 , these bunch at the back of the neck . try another brand
0	after seeing the photo and reading the other reviews i thought this would be a good buy . i 'm not really thrilled about this jacket . it 's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker . it does n't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel . this is something you can easily find at walmart on sale for $ 9.99 .
0	they 're pretty , but flimsy . very light construction . the lens is not really mirrored , so if you attempting to hide your eyes , forget it . it would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap chinese knock-off . gave them two stars simply because they are good looking , but cheap -- and they feel that way on your face .
1	great value ! have always wanted a samsonite brand , but in brighter colors . i finally purchased the single upright suitcase ( s ) and fell in-love.i bought the pink and red . my kids and i will be vacationing over seas , and i wanted a better quality , more spacious luggage.this is perfect ! the delivery turn-around time was impeccable ! we 'll be leaving in a few days to visit southeast asia . and we got our suitcases this early moning . continue the excellent customer-service
0	a good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . the previous model called the sawtooth had the shank , and the tigertooth does not . i recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe . by the way , i just loved the sawtooth from columbia . the business decision to drop the sawtooth was a mistake . the shoe was great for rocky desert hiking . i convinced 6 of my friends to buy it
0	first of all , they look cheaper than i thought they would look . but the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the top of my foot . in other words , the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot , and caused blisters . i am hoping that if i keep trying to wear them , the `` leather '' will soften up and become easier to wear
0	after one washing , the letters were all rolled up . i was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie . the quality of the graphic was horrible
0	i used to wear lame-ass y-fronts when i was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping . i made the switch to thongs after i got a girlfriend and she made it clear that i had to ditch the grandpa undies . so i did , and gladly ! there 's no way i could go back to this 'maxi ' sh*t anymore . i tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin huge ! ! i 'm talking fat-guy big . you do n't realize how big they are until you try modern stuff . so here 's my advice : if you 're still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller . you 'll be happy you did
0	i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips !
1	this bra fits , is comfortable , and invisible under t-shirts . i hope they keep making it forever
1	i hate long socks and smelly shoes so i 've become a big fan of shoe liners . i recently ordered a set of these and am very happy with them . they are each individually priced at $ 5.99 . so for 6 pairs you 'd pay $ 36 retail . so this is a good deal at $ 4/pair . more importantly , they are heavy-weight cotton with no underside seam . they have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet . they are cut generously -- my feet are about size 8 and they are a little big , but manageable . if you have smaller feet i 'd try to get a different size than m/l . they do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others -- they are fine with loafers , but a lower cut shoe could be problematic . i 've tried a lot of these socks : calvin klein , ralph lauren , donna karan , peds , leggs , et al . these are by far the best .
0	the problem i have with this purchase does not involve the product , but rather the company that i purchased them from . i had these shoes sent to my son as a gift . unfortunately , they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place , so he was unable to wear them , and since they were an online order item , it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return . the company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label , so my son could return the original pair . when i spoke to my son last week , he had not yet received the return label . i am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item . i am very unhappy with this purchase
1	the item is much better than any others that i have got through out the years . it should last a long time . not rip easy . it feels very sturdy . i think it is real good
1	these are great shoes ! the shoes are a medium-to-baby pink and they 're very `` high style '' . the shoes run true to size . the shoes are surprisingly comfortable and i got lots of raves when i wore them to a recent wedding . they 're great shoes at a good price
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
0	unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash . i think that if they work for you , they would be wonderful , but if you have sensitive skin , they are not for you . i love the idea . i am a leaky faucet and i would love an easy breast pad that worked . i am sick of sleeping with my bra on . hopefully by the time i have my next child , they will come up with something even more breathable
0	i bought this product several weeks ago . they looked nice but they are extremely sheer . they ripped right away which was very disappointing
1	love these boxers . i stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own . love the fabric and the cut , not too long not too short , and just the right amount of butt room .
0	i bought 2 sleepers . sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on . a real waste of my money
1	i bought a pair for my wife and she told me how warm her feet were while wearing them so i decided to buy a pair for myself . i wear them without socks as they are so warm and comfortable -- i think wearing socks w/ these shoes would get a little too warm for my feet .
1	i never buy stuff like this on line . i like to play with/feel wallets before getting them . but i could n't find a thin , bi-fold that i liked , so i took a chance . it 's great . the id feature is super handy ( it comes all the way out if you 're wondering ) . and the brown leather is soft and nice . it is really nice for the price . ( by the way , personally , i do n't think it 's thick at all )
1	i bought it for my boyfriend for the gym . he would carry all his extra gym clothes , wallet , keys , and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way . he really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff . not very many other products have that extra pocket . very sturdy material and the size is just right
0	the mask is way too tight , either that , or i just have an abnormally big head which i do n't think i do . it should be adjustable , and it 's not . would not recommend this
0	like i said , they did n't fit well and i was allergic to the adhesive . :
1	i gave this shoes to my girlfriend and she just love them , she says they are really confortable , and i find them really pretty . a really good buy it is
1	it 's comfortable and stays in place all day . it 's wonderful not to keep adjusting straps all day . i am so glad i bought it , and it i got it delivered fast !
1	im in the military and run quite abit about 20 miles or more a week ive had these shoes for a while now and i have to say they are the best ive ever had as far as comfort and durabilty . my current pair is about worn out and i plan to purchase a new pair of the sam
1	i purchased these for my mother as a christmas present . they are so soft to the touch and i was able to get them in a 7.5 wide which is unusual . the color is nice too
0	the color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture . also , from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows . good customer support though i could n't return it because of being a gift
0	i would not recommend these hats . you definately get what you pay for . the sizes are not true to fit and they are cheaply constructed ( even for a 6.00 hat . ) i basically threw it out . the sad thing is , i spent as much in shipping as i did on the product
1	nice sock , but the leg area was not really ample or stretchy enough , in my opinion , to be considered plus size . i will probably pass these on to my sons , who wear 8 men 's size .
0	the battery function did n't work . discovered poor battery wiring inside ... i might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering . i 'm not surprised by the crude construction from a $ 11 item . however , the hand grips themselves are worth the money . no more cramped hands
1	podría ser extraño regalar una prenda de ropa íntima , pero estos boxer son lo máximo para regalar desde un primo hasta a un compañero de estudios , y claro para la pareja - e incluso para chicas . son de algodón , muy suaves frescos y ligeros . los compré talla m y auqnue son para un caballero delgado uno m de medio llenito los puede usar con comodidad . para mi gusto son un poco largos , pero eso también provee de comodidad a su usuario . esto es más que una prenda de ropa interior es algo que provoca lucir y ver lucir . el estampado fue toda una celebración `` saluda a mi pequeño amigo '' ! ! ! ! ! ! , con este boxer puedes pasearte en interiores en tu casa y a nadie le va a molestar
1	these shoes are so comfy ! i love the no shoe string thing too . easy and comfortable . what more could you ask for
0	the bra cup itself is too big for my chest . and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30 's and 40 's it is not at all comfortable . blah ! and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure
0	maybe i 'm naive , but i never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase . they are spring-loaded , and they turn . a certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out . i got one out by sheer accident but that is it . and there are no directions included . so i 'm back to a keyring and that 's not so bad .
0	the colors of bandannas i ordered were not the colors i received . the invoice sent with the bandannas did not confirm the colors i ordered so i did not have proff that several errors were made , but i know what i ordered . i was concerned after placing the order because the colors were not stated on the checkout page , but since i had ordered them before , i thought there would not be a problem
1	my wife shopped around at amazon looking for her grandmother 's 88th b-day ( coming up soon ) and came across handmade hadong silk scarf . every silk scarf she came across she would say , `` what a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are . '' before she found vietmade silk scarfs at amazon , she had looked online stores at macy 's , nordstorm , jcpennies , but could n't really compare with the ones vietmade made . i agree with my wife when she said , `` this place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices ! ! '' when we got the scarf today 4/10/07 ( ordered 4/4/07 ) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself , one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law . my wife and i definately recommend this place and we 'll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future . also , delivery was on schedule , good packaging and love the scarfs !
1	i bought these for my son , and he says they are really comfortable ; he wears them when he plays basketball -- lots of support and no blisters . i 'll most likely buy another pair for him..
0	the actual bag itself was great . however , the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not . i ordered this bag and three weeks later it came . i had to go buy a bag to take on vacation . kind of defeated the purpose
0	wow , the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my circulation ! it is way too tight for casual wear . also , the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose , and your hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me . if you 're not an athlete , then do n't buy this skull cap . it 's meant primarily for bald football players to wear under their helmets
0	i saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute , however , when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe . very very disappointed , i will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again .
0	i 've bought the predator absolion trxfg before and it is a great shoe . however , in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair i received yesterday ( blue with red and silver ) is synthetic . make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price , you receive a leather shoe ! you are not `` saving $ 50 '' if it 's synthetic
1	the whole rubber wristband thing has gotten out of hand . do your part to put it to rest by buying regular wristbands . when it was all for charities before-thats okay . but it is ridiculous now . heres the rules : -livestrong= okay because that was the original -everything else= no . -people who wear like 5 of them= probably the main reason why you 'd starting wearing the regular ones . plus they 're way better and not some cheap piece of rubber that cost .2 cents to make . anyways ... end the fad ! ! !
0	i have seen others wear these slides and i know adidas usually supplies an excellent product . i did read the other reviews that warned of a need for `` breaking in '' the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process . however , i 've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless i continue to wear socks . i am disappointed in the slide but i will stubbornly continue to wear them . maybe some day they will be `` broken ''
0	i bought these shoes a few months ago because i liked the style of them . i wore them just about everyday . a couple of people started telling me `` you walk kind of funny in those shoes '' . they caused my ankles to turn in.i was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes . the support ( curves ) of the shoes are poorly designed . i ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way . i asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain . i contacted the company who said i could mail them to the company ( at my expense ) and they would `` inspect '' them . if they felt it was a `` manufacturers defect '' they would replace them with the same product . little good that would do . also if they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.do n't waste your money and cause yourself pain too . the company may say `` they stand by their merchandise '' but they do n't mean it !
1	these are perfect for low-rise pants . the cut will likely be flattering for any guy . the front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability , and i find the fit in the back to be basically great . an essential for those whose jeans hang low
1	i am very pleased with these shoes . they are very comfortable and look great as well .
0	i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy i made a mistake by buying i
0	i bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from oprah winfrey . i am a 38dd and could barley get the bra on . i have always been big busted and struggled to find good support . when i was younger i was trained in classical ballet . i have no problem with range of motion . i still had a hard time getting this bra on . not to mention , i was falling out all over the place . i am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money . i would recommend `` jogbra '' or `` chamion '' for less money , better fit and better hold if you are big busted .
1	if your girlfriend is a fan of hello kitty then you ca n't go wrong with the cami/panty combo . its cute but sexy . very nice
1	overall i 'm happy with the skin . it fits the treo 700 very closely . this was custom formed for every curve , bump , and button on the treo . my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p . i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it . the 700w and p , if you do n't know , are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen . the button layout is the same , but they different icons and purposes . well , the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w , not the 700p . not a huge deal , just a slight annoyance . i 'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow
1	these shirts are hard to find during certain seasons . i was very happy to find that amazon had them . the quality of these shirts have lasted a long time . the fit is perfect and comfortable
1	they are awesome , only tricky part is making sure you get the right size , my husband and i love them
0	`` sling '' is a misnomer for this gimmick ... think `` tourniquet '' and you 'll be closer to the reality . there are several buttons and eyes on the `` sling '' to adjust the fit . i tried every configuration , and they all felt too tight . a snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put , but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers : the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around . despite the problems with the strap , i like the briefs . my recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap . the sling technology needs more r before it 's ready for the big time
1	this item was as i expected as far as the description , it is the quality i expected and i am pleased with it . however , i bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit ( it fit the way i feared the 2-x would fit that 's why i bought the 3-x ) . do n't know if it was mis-sized or what
1	i got this hat because it reminded me of what jack nicholson wore in one flew over the cuckoo 's nest . i 'm happy to say it also keeps my head quite warm . cashmere is very soft and it breathes well ( my head never feels too hot )
0	do not buy this i got a large and feels like a smal
0	i ordered this dress on march 6th . i recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by march 8th . on march 16th , i receive an email saying that they are out the size i wanted and my order has been canceled . this is unacceptable from a business . i should have been notified by march 9th that the dress had not been shipped . i have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress . thanks alot
0	good , flattering fit . i 'm 5'2 '' and i bought a short which was perfect and long enough to wear with heels , even a bit long actually . unfortunately when i washed them , they shrank 2 '' and now i have to wear them with flats . i would buy them again , just in a longer length
0	i ordered these pajamas for a xmas gift for someone that loves happy bunny . the pj 's were cheaply made and the pants were very short ... it did n't say anywhere in the description that that were capri length . they were definitely not worth the price
0	it wo n't help you get dry , it 's more of a robe to hang out . i had to return it and the seller was really nice and gave me a refund
1	this is a one of a kind handbag . great on a night out or just for kicks ! unbeatable price for such a genuine item . do n't have one ? get one ! http : //handbags.freepay.com/ ? r=27259751
1	i tried these on and i 'll never wear boxers again ! they are very confortable and i sleep in them everynight . they are tight , but not too tight . i wear these to school as well ! i love them
0	this adapter nearly caught fire the first time i used it . watch out
1	the shorts were everything i wanted . the service was 5 star and my husband wears these short all the time . i bought him all the colours available
0	..all over the neighbourhood . now we 're getting divorced and it 's all your fault male power sheer bong thong ! i hate you
0	this bra has an akward fit . i had to return it . a better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria 's secret
0	dont buy parents on less you want to have to remove your kids under wear from there butt 's or if you want to tie a chain and lock around there pants so they dont get panted , so dont but these because removing under wear can be award
1	these are the first mootsies tootsies i have owned and i love em.since then i have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots . these shoes are very comfortable
0	this bra was well made , fabric very soft but the sizes were way off . cup is cut to big , it would be difficult to wear a scoop , or v neck top , as the cup covers to much of chest area . would not buy this brand again or style again , even for $ 7 each
0	i bought 3 fleece with different size but the size of the fleece are not proper . though it says medium / large / xl , everything was in same size and the length is not proper as the measurement mentioned .
0	this is a disgraceful garment . i am not kidding when i say that the `` sweater '' is less than 1 mm thick . the best description that i could give you is tracing paper . it is virtually see-through . when i put it on for the first time , all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed . there is also an obnoxious `` z '' on the left chest area . very tacky . this will be in the very back of my closet until i get around to donating it or throwing it away . miserable , miserable purchase .
1	as the weather has cooled for fall and winter , i needed socks for my baby . i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just did n't hold up as well . i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom , but they were so thick my son just sweated in them . the children 's place socks are not too thick and very durable . also , the non-slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked . the other socks did not ! i strongly recommend these socks for your child
0	the shoes are true to size and very comfortable . but only 3 months after purchase the sole and the upper leather are starting to seperate . really expected a better quality .
0	a sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise , but this one does n't . also , the construction leaves something to be desired . it 's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks , where the seams are sewn . i bought two . after trying them several times , i gave up and sent them to charity . do n't bother
0	i love the style , fabric , fit , extremely comfortable ( but it is a t-shirt ) i 'm 5'2 and it does n't come past my hips
0	i would definitely recommend getting a size and width larger , as these fit very snuggly
0	i ordered 4 of them because they were on sale . but all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be . in addition , the fabric is bad . there are tores in all of the edges
0	boots are very , very , dark brown , look nothing like the picture , fit poorly , an item that has to be fitted before purchasing
1	these boots are so warm and soft ! i usually wear a 7.5 and i ordered them in size 7 ( even though they recommend sizing up for half sizes ) and they fit perfectly . an awesome ( and cheaper ) alternative to uggs
0	the scarves were good quality but i should have paid more attention to previous reviewers on this gift . the pack had about 5 or 6 black scarves and a couple other colors , nothing like the picture . save your dough on these scarves
1	these look great with jeans , though i 'm not a fan with skirts . i bought the black and now wish i could find the bronze in my size . i normally wear a 9 , and depending on the brand i sometimes need a wide , but these i found the 8.5ww fits perfectly - go figure . naturalizer runs very , very narrow . i love , love these shoes . i can dance all night without pain = ) they are very cushioned , the top straps do not cut at all , and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2 '' heel . i so wish i could find these in other colors in ww !
0	those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me
1	i have the gown too and ordered the pj 's from the direct website . they are the same great quality and the bottoms are so cute , i wear them all the time out of the house
0	these boots were the worst ever ! they were grossly missized and not as depicted . the back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering . when returned , the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving . never again
0	this seller fails to state that the snap is in the inner lower corner of each cup which is probably why its so cheap . when i opened the package and unsnapped the cup the entire snap fell off . when i emailed alys 's customer service they said only unopened merchandise is returnable . needless to say , i do n't recommend this bra
1	i was pleased with all purchase . i did not feel that i was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer . in addition for reasons that are not clear to me , i continue to get duplicate orders , or the order is sent to an old address . the return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
1	the service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly . just what i expected and wanted
0	i bought these shoes to do aerobics in . they look good and are comfortable , but only to walk in . there is zero arch support and when i walk in them i feel as if my feet are flat on the ground . there is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics . my old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones , but i ca n't use the old ones . the gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes . they are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt . i am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location . now i have to look again
1	there are n't many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team , as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time . red sox hats , however , are just such an item . go sox
1	fits great on my ipod nano . does not slip off like other silicone covers . pretty durable and great protective piece for the nano . con : do plastic cover or protection for the screen
1	i bought these slippers as a christams gift for my 16 year old daughter , she was very happy to get them as i guess they are the `` in '' thing for teenagers in her school . she loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy ! price is high , but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper , these are more like shoes than slippers . the sheep skin wool lining is very sturdy luxerious
0	the fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes i received . they look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects . i am sure i will not show them off much when i wear them
1	i bought these for my son for christmas , they were first quality , arrived in time for christmas , and at a great price
1	this shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt . it is unlined , has a bit of stretch for comfort , and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts . i think it runs true to size and matches the color on-screen . i bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter , and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt . it was almost thirteen dollars then , but i have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal
1	at first i had my heart set on a different cloak , but when it was no longer available i decided to go with this one . i am very pleased that i was not disappointed . this cloak looks and feels beautiful . it has a nice button closure at the neck , and for those that are petite it is floor length . this cloak is just what i was looking for to add a last minute touch to my halloween costume . it is very comfortable and soft , no itchy feel here
0	i got the largest size they had ( size 10 ) and my toes were crunched in . they fit my mom just barely , and she 's a size 8. i wanted to get my money back for it , but it 'd probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back , then it actually costed to begin with .
1	the product was as advertised and delivered on time
1	this item was a great buy , fast delivery and was given as a gift ... thank
1	like wearing a moccasin only with more support . more supple than most driving shoes , and light weight too . soles wear very well , as do uppers . a great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe , yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in southern cal
0	beware , this item is not a zip front hoodie as the item description says . it is a pullover !
1	this is a very sexy pair of underwear . guys : if you 're new to the thong/g-string scene , this is a good place to start . i recommend g-strings because there 's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs . the reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because it 's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear . your girlfriend will love it . mine did
1	i love these shoes , they are so comfortable and give great support . these are my second pair . the merchant got them to me really fast and i appreciate that . though when i ordered i thought the amazon site specified free shipping so i was surprised at that
1	i love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them . i am the envy of the girls at work
0	one of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other . genius ! not . the result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other . grrr ... one more thing , only the screen is protected by a clear plastic . the wheel is not
1	these are my single favorite pair of underwear . not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish . i 'm in the military so at first i thought `` thongs are not for `` real men '' but after wearing these i found they are , and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize . i wear these for every day activivties , sports , work , and leisure . there is n't much fabric so they 're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy . after wearing them for a while it 's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it . if you 've never owned a thong , i think you should give these a shot.i definately recomend the 2xist y back thong
1	not only are these shoes great looking on ... they are extremely comfortable . i went back and bought two addtional pairs in different colors
0	i purchased this scarf as a christmas present for my daughter-in-law . it was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope . i had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store . i would have been embarrassed to give her the pashmina scarf . it was a wasted of money
0	these look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick , ruining the shoes completely . do not buy them .
1	this is a beautiful shoe by rockport , but beware , it runs really narrow . i even went a size up from my usual to compensate . i ended-up sending them back anyway . so if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal
0	the jacket is cut undersized , typical of foreign makes with poor quality control . the lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity . exterior shell has nice feel , but overall , a poor piece of work
1	this is a very nice leather bag . it has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over . the pockets do not close and i have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed . that is the only problem i can see with this bag
1	these black satin isotoner slippers are extremely comfortable and fit extremely well . they are flexible enough to mold to the shape of your feet but strong enough to cushion your feet , as well . they are well worth the purchase
0	nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ? it looks good but is it 4 '' x 8 '' or 12 '' x 8 '' ? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy ... ... ... ... . da trol
1	if you have the body to show for it , by all means wear it alone
0	turn around time to receive item was good . material of the shirt was sub-par ( very thin ) for the price .
1	very nice sandal , lookes great with a dress or jeans . low enough to wear for hours at a time , but high enough heel to make it look chic
0	i purchased this skin to accompany my daughter 's new mp3 player . we managed to tear the skin first thing out of the box even though we were being careful , or so we thought . i expected higher durablity
1	i love birkenstocks and when i saw the eaton clog at such a low price , well , say no more . once you know your size , you can buy birkenstocks from anywhere . i just never expected to find them on amazon.com . they 're a little dressier style than my usual bostons and i just love them
1	i love this bag ! i purchased the pink/chocolate color and i get alot of compliments on how cute it is . i am in my early 20 's and i have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what i need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time , is very stylish . i really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms , but they are very expensive . this is lightweight , made of cotton , so very easy to clean . i chose standard shipping and it came so quickly . i am very satisfied with my purchase
0	i ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees ' in the same size , i thought . when i received the shipment , all 4 tees ' were different sizes [ even though they were all labeled the same size ] . i have returned the items since the tees ' run two sizes too small , and the workmanship is questionable , which translates into ... that i will not be able to give this item to my loved one for christmas .
1	this swim jock is a great all around jock . very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps . mine has taken a beating , and has not fallen apart like other jocks i own . the swim style is cut very low in front , with a fairly small pouch . not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts , it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play . the low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans , not to mention the barely there skimpy factor . heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans ... ..looks and feels hot ! if you 're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear , this jock is a great buy for the price .
1	was delivered quickly , was priced right , and folded up into a small size so i could stuff it into a suitcase before going on vacation . when unfolded it held more than the suitcase . high quality material and excellent workmanship . i think i 'll buy another one for a spare
1	this is the most comfortable sports shoe that i have worn and i own just about every brand made
0	you can use this case for storage which is what i do now . it does n't allow me to click the buttons , the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it 's down so i ca n't access them . overall , it 's ok for just keeping your player in there . i really recommend an invisible shield , it works better than this case for sure . this case is a bit bulky , but it 's alright if you do n't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in . sometimes when you put it back in , it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is . basically , if you want a case to keep it in this is n't too bad , but another product is better for sure . either my case was jinxed or they are all like that .
0	i bought these for my younger than three month old son , he did n't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt . i ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together . i do not suggest that anyone buy these
0	on sept 17 i ordered a cashmere wrap . i finally got the company 's attention when i placed a negative review on this forum . i was told if i removed the review after recieving the item , i would be credited for shipping . the item arrived oct 16 . as of today , november 20 , my credit card had not been credited . i emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days .
0	the bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all , but either i have a big head or something becuase it does n't cover my ears all the way . as for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine . so i guess if you have a big head do n't get it becuase it will not cover your ears .
1	i love this umbrella . it 's just the right size and works perfectly . it 's so pretty that i do n't want to get it wet ! !
0	this is a very styling money clip , however , it is not like a big paper clip . it opens like a butterfly , then closes together with the strenght of the magnets . it feels that your money and other cards might fall off . i 'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information
1	after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i 've ran across . i love it .
1	i bought these for my husband and he loves them . they 're well made and super comfortable . he liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color . highly recommended
0	the robe does not fit me . i wanted to return it , got a return item number , got busy , and did not get it in the mail soon enough . they have a strict 30 day return ploicy . nordstroms does not do this . i could exchange it there . sorry i got a job and not time for petty rules . i will go elsewhere next time
0	i was very disappointed with this bra . i would definately not recommend it . if you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the maternelle bra instead . this bra looks sexy , but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra ( at least not for a size 38dd )
1	this is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you 're looking for a slightly wider toe box . it looks great with a skirt or slacks . my only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable , and kindest to my feet , i ca n't find my size ( 6.5 w ) in navy . i have the shoe in black . if anyone from naturalizer is reading this message ; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available
0	this bag is so cheap looking i am embarrassed to use it . when i saw it online it looked identical to a us luggage bag i bought at tj maxx , which was stolen . so , i was very excited to find what i thought was the same bag on amazon to replace it . when i got it , i was shocked at how cheap it looks . the handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous . the return policy through ebags is such a hassle that i am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work , but i will still need to find a better travel laptop bag . i 'm very disappointed . if you 're looking for a professional looking laptop bag , this is n't it . i should have known better for the price , but like i said , i thought it was the same as the other us luggage bag i had , which was gorgeous and i loved it . oh well .
0	this is an okay jacket . the padding in it is okay . sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal . there is no liner , and you will get cold riding at night . overall the jacket has only 2 layers , and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh . spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up
0	i ordered a pair and they were too big ... so when i asked for a rma number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a ups lable ... one month later it did not come ... each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me ... . whereas i know it is do-able.. bargain outfitters can as well as can online shoes .. so finally i paid $ 15 to send the boots back . on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $ .. i not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee . i will never ever buy from the sportsman 's guide again ...
0	after wearing the betula birkenstocks for about an hour , the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle . happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked . midwest wont take them back since i wore them .
0	apparently there is an error in the item description . these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive . i new they probably were not waterproof when i put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway ... stupid me .
0	i bought this as a surprise for my wife . when we opened it , i thought that 1 ) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2 ) they had n't finished it . edges are raw and unfinished . it is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost . i understand that `` you get what you pay for , '' but this was a piece of garbage . this dress in the picture is obviously pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever . the picture does not accurately represent this item at all . this will fit like a potato sack , folks . i notice that the `` raw edges '' are now listed as a `` feature . '' ahem . in a recent e-mail exchange with them , i was told that ( their words now ) : `` quality is a subjective issue . '' they have pestered me to change my feedback and i have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback , and i would absolutely recant them . in their defense : my money has now been refunded . now ... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it , worn for 90 seconds ? it would have been off sooner , but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head . wish i could rate as a `` zero
0	ordered gray , they shipped black . since it is from canada i 'm not even going to waste return shipping charges . minor inconvenience , yet still folks , i ordered gray ! pants are also not new , the tags are ripped and torn , it looks like return or wholesale merchandise . i feel cheated , angry , but mostly just disappointed . for shame people , for ... .shame ... .
1	these are so great , and keep my baby 's feet warm . she even slept with them on with no problem . she 's been a master at getting her socks off up until now . they also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails . she 's chewing on the toes but i have n't seen any scuff marks yet , so they are holding up very well
0	i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo , but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front . the boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy , and the ties up the back looked awful . it might be good for someone with a different figure than mine , but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it
1	ordering was easy , arrived in 4 days , gloves fit , well and good quality , good buy , recommend to purchas
1	my baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old . i ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months . they are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months . hats are made of t-shirt fabric and look just like the picture . you do have to tie your own knot on the top . andrew christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days , but within the shipping time specified
1	i 've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily , sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes . my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here , after months of searching ! the heel is nice and soft but there 's still sufficient support here ( for me that is . for those of you out there with back problems , it might not be sufficient ) . i got them in the gold , which is a gorgeous pale lame , and am currently lusting over the black :
0	i was informed in october that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited . i think maybe i should check my bank statement for that time
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
1	i 've been buying these sandals for 30 years . i just love them
1	this is a well made rugged coat . sort of a north face/ mountain hardware coat for the farm/ ranch . not a summer coat too heavy ! ! ! the next model needs to have pit zips !
0	this hat is not suitable for a small child . it is way too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff . if i had been there when it arrived , i would have sent it back
0	even for only $ 12 , these were n't worth the money . they came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine , or some other noxious chemical and now , at least 2 months since i have received them , the smell has not dissipated . they are extremely stiff , so even if they did n't reek , i still would n't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day . i guess that 's what i get for buying cheap shoes
0	i purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable and because they looked like they were made of leather . they are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not attractive . they will be returned .
1	love these little gems ... perfect at 1 size below normal size . you wo n't want to take them off
1	these shoes are so comfortable and cute ! i 've gotten a lot of compliments on them , and i like their old-school pony look
0	i want to start by saying fred flare- shipped this product very fast ! ! and the transaction itself was very smooth . i do however , have extreme problems with the product itself . the product is not leather , its nylon , and it sort of looks cheap ? the inside material is sued , but that 's only the lining for the base of the wallet . also , the wallet part is very hard to use . you cant really put too much in the wallet- the credit card slots are a little too snug , and there is no place for my i.d . the wallet included a small `` note book '' but it also does n't fit in the wallet ? i was very excited about this product , but now i feel duped . the pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality , and that it was user friendly , but it 's not . i do not recommend this product
0	would love to order these , but sizes are not clear . does small fit a toddler , is small a size 7 ? not sure how to order .
0	i ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of december and never received the item . i am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me . if people ca n't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out . two thumbs down
0	not as expected , too short , nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks
0	i love vanity fair . their bras just fit me perfectly . when this bra arrived i quickly found it was not vanity fair . not only that , but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material . i tried it on in hopes it may fit . it was the most uncomfortable bra i have ever tried on . not because of size . it was bulky , rough and obviously inexpensively made . the tag said something along the lines of , `` made in hong kong .
0	i have yet to reccived tham so i can not review tham till i reccive them . thank you , robert but
1	my daughter 's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform . i had an awful time searching the net to find any until i came across these . they are very soft and comfortable . my daughter only wants these types of socks from now on . but from a mom 's point of view they are hard to keep white . even with soaking in bleach i ca n't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring . other than that , they 're great
1	recently , i took a motorcycle trip from atlanta , ga to ft. lauderdale , fl . unfortunately , i did n't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110 , it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face . i also did n't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so i would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down . after getting home , i recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket , preferrably mesh . i was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so i went online and ordered one . the particular model i ordered from amazon is the deluxe evaporative cooling vest in black . it came about a week after i ordered it via usps priority mail . they offer several styles and colors , including some that have removable sleeves the outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside , zippered pockets and a zipper up the front . the neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want . the inner liner is blue and is 100 % nylon taslan , a water repellant fabric , so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it . out of the package , it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water , the special material , called polymer embedded fabric ( pef ) , between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs . you only need to soak it for about a minute . there are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion . i got the large size and it fits great , not too tight , not too loose . once the water is absorbed , the instructions ( on the tag in the vest ) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry . not being like a sponge , wringing it does n't do a lot of good so i 'd suggest blotting if you need to . while the inner liner is water repellant , there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you do n't soak it too long , the inner liner will be relatively dry . the material that holds the water does n't expand like a sponge , it just holds lots of water ... it 's pretty interesting stuff . the first thing you 'll notice after a few seconds is that it 's cool to the touch . the principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works . i have n't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet , but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool . i do n't think i 'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg ( f ) because i 'd probably freeze nor would i want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it . the inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp . the cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets , they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they 'll stay relatively dry . one thing i 've found though , it 'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it . the water is very slow to evaporate but once it does , the weight goes back down to a few ounces . bottom line , i highly recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather . they 're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they 're stylish ( except for the hi-vis lime green ) . wear it under a mesh jacket and you wo n't know it 's hot outside .
0	the other reviewer is spot on . these are pretty ( but not truly mirrored ) and they broke after only 4 weeks use . i bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price . definitely not worth the $ 16
0	these pants were washed one time , following the washing instructions , they were not put in the dryer , and they shrunk not only around , but lengthwise . i had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and did n't have any problems . i look forward to your reply
0	i had this bag on my wishlist and got it for christmas . i wanted it for when i take daytrips to the beach . i am really disappointed with the size . it 's pretty deep , but not very wide at all . no way i 'll be able to take everything i need to the beach in this bag . still , i 'll be able to use it for other things
1	my mother loves these pants . i know they are for men , but she loves the way they fit her . they are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better .
1	my husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer .
0	i have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats . i 'm very disappointed . this is supposed to be a reversible coat . however , the hem of the black side is too long . consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed . and , it does not look good at all . the company needs to revise this pattern
1	this is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever . i highly recommend it
0	these pants did not look good on me . they seem built for thin people . while not obese , i am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me . the material is nice , though
0	and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas
1	these are great socks . in the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13 . i assume that is the same as shoe size , but it is not explained . this , however , is an important point , since i wear a size 10 shoe . i can wear the socks and i really like them but i wish they were a little smaller . one size does not fit all .
1	nice , soft leatherette . the inside is roomy , and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio . the tie-front detail stays so , you do n't have to worry about it unraveling or loosening . nice silver buckle accents on strap . great
1	the presentation of the product is claer and attractive and the product is durable , comfortable and goodlooking
0	i ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie . there 's there 's zero stretch in this , it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big . since they 're short from crotch to waist anyway , it does n't much matter . the top fits better , since you adjust it . the cut is still quite poor and , again , there 's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders . it 's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust . it 's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem . if you 're narrow through the hips , shoulders or bust , this combo will probably be a nice fit . if you 're curvy , you might want to rethink this . it 's a shame since it comes in plus sizes . maybe i should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit imo
1	arrived fast and in time for v-day ! thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival
1	i love my soft and comfortable green robe that i received last year for mother 's day ! whenever i wear it , i want to just relax with a magazine or watch tv , and then fall asleep in it . the matching green slippers complete the feel , and i really feel pampered . i never knew i could feel so good wearing a robe , especially since i was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe ! this is such an excellent product and great gift !
1	this is the best brand of slippers i have ever owned ! i have a cute pink pair that i slip into the minute i get home . they have lasted for several years now , and they are still in good shape . these slippers are so comfortable , and they stay on my feet without any effort . they are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm , and my feet never sweat in them , even without socks ! this style runs large , and i wear a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers . after wearing them the first week , i noticed they got a little roomier , but they still stay on just fine . they are my only pair of house shoes at the moment . i just ordered a new pair in a different style ( in pink , of course ) , and i have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me . try dearfoams and your feet will thank you
0	this coat was listed as camel , but when it arrived it was actually tan . even the tag says tan . i was disappointed because it was the only christmas gift that i had for my husband . i never would have ordered a tan . also the coat fit like a whole size larger . i had to return it and it has been well over a month and i still have not received my refund
0	i bought these slippers as a present for my husband for christmas . i ca n't return them because he wore them for a day . these slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers . the shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left . do n't waste your money
1	shoe pretty true to size , good shoe for the money . i buy nike shox often and decided to try these for the price . not as cushy as a nike shox but also half the cost or less ! for the price it is a comfy shoe and i would recommend it if you have wider feet and or do n't want to send $ 90.00 and up for shox
0	i am still waiting for a credit to my credit card account . the item was not available and they said i would be credited . still waiting !
0	this shoe looked nice and stylish , but turned out to be very narrow ( even though i 've ordered it in size wide ! ! ! ) and uncomfortable . also had some glue marks on it -- i had to return it
0	i have done a review on these socks already , which has not appeared . they are not a good buy
1	just got them in the mail today . as other kenneth cole reaction shoes , it runs one size larger . i 'm usually a 12 but i ordered an 11 and they fit just right . these boots look great with jeans . the color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph .
0	i purchased two of these sports bras based on brand , price , and product description . this is a very uncomfortable bra for runners . the seams chafe and it does not `` wick away moisture . '' the slow shipping did n't help my opinion either . it is a nice bra for less active endeavors .
1	i ordered this boot in a size 7 , pewter . very cute boot and fits perfectly . very comfortable fit and feel . everyone who saw them wanted to know where i got them ! simply darling boot
1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than $ 30 , retail price , even on sale , was $ 60 . the jacket arrived in about a week . its nice and warm , very good quality . the upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear . it fits great and looks good . only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little . but all in all i 'm very pleased
1	my baby loves his new kicks ! ! they came quick and would recomend them to anyone
1	hesitantly , i ordered my first pair of folk readers ; now i 'm back for a second pair . they 're comfortable , unique , well-crafted and the company offers excellent service - a winner
0	too bad there was n't a rating of 0 star . this is the worst piece of junk i ever bought . first of all we were looking for a brand called sports afield . this item fell under it when we did a search . when it arrived it was some off the wall brand.they were paper thin but thought maybe they were warm being it was from an army and navy store . wrong ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they served no purpose at all.were not warm at all . .we washed them per directios on tag and shrunk so bad i do n't think a 2 yr old could fit in them.do not buy ! ! ! ! ! ! jun
1	i like this fragance and the shipment was awsome , i did n't know what they supose to be here and when i check de tracking it was like delivered and i check my mail and it was there ! awsome awsome awsom
1	not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that . i am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks , nike etc , i decided to try the crocs and have not gone back ! ! ! its like walking with slippers on . i have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day . by that night my feet and back were hurting so bad i didnt want to do much but sit down . right then and there i made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again ! ! ! i do wish they were a little cheaper so i could add all the colors to my wardrobe . buy them you wont be sorry ! ! stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !
1	i got my adidas adissage wht/pnk sandals in record time . i was able to take them on my trip with me as intended . also , the price was the best that i had seen on the internet .
0	the elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear . otherwise , the quality of the lace shoes is good . i 'd wear them if the elastic did n't dig into my foot ( i have small feet too ! )
1	i was asked by my daughter to get these for christmas . i got some for myself for my morning walks in -30c temps . they do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day , even when i have just gotten it done , and keep my ears toasty warm . great product and worth the money . my daughter is equally impressed .
1	this is a great item to have if you are loosing weight . you can adjust the belt as needed without having to buy new ones
0	i ordered these white tank tops and 3 colored tank tops . i have never received these white tank tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither . i have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve
0	company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt . i ordered 3 different shirts . this shirt is large in size but very short ! not what i had expected . asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were christmas gifts for my daughter . i received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem .
0	i 'm just not too crazy about this thing . does n't quite fit right or look right ... at least i only paid 5 bucks..
0	the cheaper variety at walmart ( $ 8.92 versus $ 19 and up ) , no boundaries brand , is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm , more like a birkenstock cork sole which i also find very comfortable , for me anyway . they do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way . walmart also has a real color explosion going on . you can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself . so , for the cheaper price walmart offers , i feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there . if you are looking for a firm birkestock type sole , the no boundaries brand croc is a shoe-in , no pun intended .
0	when i purchased this , i was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped . the skin is so thin , that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons . the belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that i used it . do n't waste your money , spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while .
0	the pajamas are way to long . they look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall
0	these socks are okay , but after one wash , they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good . so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz . also they are too warm socks
0	are customers to guess what is a `` small '' size compared to a `` large size ? '' is the small for a todder , pre-schooler or teenager ? what a waste of time trying to find information on this web-site about the sizes .
0	i am ex us army , national guard and army reserve . i did not expect to receive dress web belts made in china and taiwan from an army navy store . i have other belts made in usa that are heavier materials ( belt and buckle ) . the belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new ! i ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking i would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life . the web material is very thin for a belt . the buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in china . they are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing . i will not recommend this product to anybody . after shipping this junk cost me $ 47.00 !
0	i am a 38 ff , and i was hoping this would help hold me in while running - not ! this bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price ! i 'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in ! this one is going back
0	i bought this bra because the ad says 100 % cotton . there is no cotton in this bra . it is 86 % nylon and 14 % elastane . if you want a cotton bra , this is not for you
1	i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items
0	easy to install . we used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running , but no movement . hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times . we tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you ca n't open it to see the inner workings . i have never received a bad item from amazon before- i am very disappointed with this product .
1	every time i wear this tie , it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were , and when cartoons were cartoons . also working in a place with a lot of kids , they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on . i 've had this tie for 3 years now , high quality , and does not stain really easy ( at least for me , great quality ) . only downfall , a little dated with a 32 cent stamp . kids do n't notice , and neither do most adults . worth picking up , great price
1	purchased these for my husband . he absolutely loves these sandals . he initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange . however , he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard . he uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors . wears them every day . thanks for a nice slip-on ! also these are sturdy though very light weight
1	i 'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers . i run around the house in socks . i 'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold , plus i run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop , turn on the water for a tree or plant , etc ... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes . these slippers are very soft , but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry . the light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however , but so far i 've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such ( laugh with me ) . yes i 'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up
0	i returned this bra to exchange for size the day after i received it in october . it is now january and i have not yet received the replacement . i have called several times but to no avail ! i ca n't give a good review of this product because i have n't actually gotten to wear the bra
1	soft , durable , breathable fabric . perfectly flexible for vigorous practice . i 'm glad i bought these
0	really uncomfortable . i wore them twice and then threw them out . they sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little . and they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment . not worth the $ 5 i paid
0	i bought this wallet for my niece and then ended up returning it . the quality is poor . the wallet is really hard to use because the compartments do not open all the way . also , the wallet actually looked fake ( not sure if it is ) because the xoxo is upside down . you can not tell from looking at the picture .
1	these boots are gorgeous ! i got such an awesome deal on these boots ; i searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them ! i 'll put one up here . they 're comfy , rich leather , well made . i 've always wanted frye boots
1	i love the shoes , very comfortable and i can wear them with just about anything
0	boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost $ 20 to return/exchange
1	very smooth transaction and timely delivery . first time on-line shoe buyer . i tried those cute shoes on at a local shoe store and loved them but was not willing to pay high price for them . i saved about 35 % by purchasing here !
1	i love these shoes ! they are so comfy and look good . the price is a bit steep , i think , but considering i could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them , i guess they are worth it . definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown !
1	got this for my father . he loves it . great coverage . easy to use
0	ordered mens 6.5 for my son , shoes are sized a womans 6.5 ( say mens 6.5 on box and shoe ) . i 'm going to have to pay $ 6.50 to return them for a larger size . do n't waste your money , buy nikes
1	the robe is very warm and heavy , perfect for cold mornings and the `` just out of the shower chills '' that you get . it doesnt quite have the `` luxurious '' feel of a spa robe , and the thread loops are matted in certain areas , but quality wise it is better than anything else i 've seen for similar prices . the length is much shorter than pictured . i bought this for my boyfriend , who is 6 ft , 190 lbs , average build , and it comes just above his knee ! all in all , it 's a decent robe for the price and he likes it .
1	great price . i have another pair of these shoes i bought elsewhere at twice this price . very comfortable . true to size .
0	poor quality , belts do not fit correctly , can not be returned because it is swimwear according to policy . do n't trust skinny dip swimwear
1	it will definitely get her attention in the best possible way
1	well constructed blazer . great color . you can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church .
1	i found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great . i recommend this for anyone looking for great bag , especially as a gift
0	i just mailed those back this past week to beall 's in florida . however , when the mailman took it from my mailbox ( i am 83 and no car ) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . there was $ l.71 due . so , i put ( 5 ) 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . however , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 i had put on it . i called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed i was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . he was n't a happy camper , but i did send it back , and i trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . i was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... .they were okay , but by that time , i had changed my mind about them , too . also , i had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it . jeanne alle
1	very warm and comfortable for the price . for any price , really . nice , looks good , feels comfy , keeps warm and cuts wind without reducing hearing in the least
1	the carhartt a110 cold weather merino wool socks were a gift for my son . he has been very happy with them , keeping him very warm in the cold of wyoming and colorado . i would definitely buy another pair for him and maybe for myself
1	this is the best sports bra i 've ever had ! i show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that , as i gaited the dog around the ring , i was bouncing ! now , no more bounce and extreme comfort . i 've had the bras for over 6 months now and they 've held up well . everyone that i 've recommended the bra to has had similar experiences
1	the slippers were perfect , exactly what i wanted . the price was good and they were delivered sooner then i expected . i 'm very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do . thank you very much
0	the sling support feature on these underwear is practically useless . my testicles always slip completely out of the sling before i 've had them on for even an hour . if these briefs enhance a man 's `` profile '' at all , it 's because they 're so darn tight ; it has nothing to do with the sling support . and talk about `` low-rise '' -- the top of my crack is exposed even when they 're pulled all the way up . i 'm in pretty good shape , but if these things shrink in the dryer , i wo n't be able to fit into them anymore . my advice : anybody ordering c-in² briefs should go one size larger than what he 'd normally wear
0	had only 4 wks ... ... poss . washed 2x ( and hung dry ) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me
0	i had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand . the socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle . they are not comfortable to wear and overall , a big disappointment
0	i washed 'em and they shrunk up so small i ca n't wear 'em anymore , bummer
0	this is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover . the plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing . the collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark . a cotton , cotton blend , or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses
1	as an advanced exerciser , i am always looking for a new , innovative challenge . the firm body sculpting ball workout provides just that . this workout comes with a sculpting ball , which is available in three weights ( four , six or eight pounds ) . i used the eight pound variety , and by the time we got to the ab work , i was ready to put the ball away ! my arms really got a workout , as did my core . there are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you , over your head , and move it diagonally across your body . i could really feel it in my core after the workout . once we completed several segments of standing work , including grapevine , squats , and lunges , we go to the floor for bridge work and abs . you have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work , which i found challenging since by that time i was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me . you also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches , which is difficult with such a heavy ball . afterwards is a short cool down , which i thought could have been longer . tina leads , and she is very fit and quite personable . she cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way . as with all the new firm releases , the background is sterile and boring . there are four background exercisers , with allison showing beginner moves . allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves . the music is nice and non-intrusive . beginners will enjoy this workout . it is n't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout . unless you 're advanced and have some good upper body strength , i would not recommend the eight pound ball . you could injure yourself if you go to heavy . in fact , i was wishing i had another , lighter ball for the floor work . i have all eight new workouts , and i 've done three so far . of those , i liked this one the best . i felt i got a good workout , but i wish it were longer . the entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long . another 15 minutes would have been great , although i suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we 'd kept going much longer . overall , i give this workout high marks . it 's definitely a keeper
0	i purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to japan . however , it was way too thin to keep her warm . after using it for about an hour , we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline . since i spent over 40 dollars on this blanket i could n't even throw this away . i had to haul it around for the entire trip . i do not think it is worth 40+ dollars . 10 dollars blanket would do the same ( or even better ) job than this
0	the skin is fine and all the extras were nice . the one thing i really needed was a good elastic band for the arm . this product does not have a good elastic band . it 's too thin and not durable enough
0	bad shoe for sure . it is not for running . but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work . this may d
0	i ordered this dress and when i received it , i thought that it was very pretty . when i put the dress on , it was completely see through . you could see my bandaid on my thigh . i would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material . it 's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable . it would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress ( including pasties ) because it seemed to show everything
0	i would not buy this sweater . it is flimsy , and not very quality feeling . the price was too good to be true
0	i bought this item because it said `` optional belt clip . '' the belt clip is only `` optional '' if you `` opt '' to leave it on and not use it . you can not `` opt '' to take it off . i would not call this belt clip `` optional . '' i would call it `` will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it , '' which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in
0	these gloves are very soft and seem to be made well , but they have a big flaw : the fingers are too short . ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems
1	i love my new steve maddens ! they are brand new as described and i received them verrrry quickly
1	i found these at lane bryant and i absolutely love them ! i wear them under my work clothes every day . you 've got to try them
1	i purchased this bre several weeks ago and found it to be the most confortable top i 've worn to date . since then i have purchased 4 more
0	i want to help overseas products , but this advertises itself as cashmere . it itches my neck ! cashmere does not itch . color was not represented appropriately
1	this top runs small , so order next size up . vibrant colors , nice fabric , comfy , attractive fit .
0	this bag is much smaller then i was expecting . the zippers do not open/shut easily . i was very disapointed
0	this bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable . the lace cups is n't feel like flour sack material .
0	oh my . it enhanced my rolls instead of hide them . it did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt , which was very noticeable . not worth the money charged for it .
0	judging from the picture , i thought this thing looked like a turban ! it actually has no wrapped fabric , but is a firmly fitting cap . hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads , which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap . aside from this , the coloring is too bold . old glory will select random coloration for each customer , but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture ! i do n't see how i can wear it without attracting stares
0	have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems . this time was different . they sent the wrong shorts . i paid the shipping to send them back . i asked , please send the right shorts . they credited my account an amount smaller than i paid . and that was that . certainly not satisfied .
1	to echo another reviewer : i am a heavy runner with high ( semi-flexible ) arches and a neutral stride , running 20-35 miles per week . even though my strides are consistent in terms of length , pronation , and heal-to-toe gait , i tend to have very heavy footfalls ( being a former sprinter with muscular legs ) and need a well-cushioned shoe . i am training for the boston marathon and have tried asics gel kayanos ( the shoe designed for the `` clydesdale type '' runner ) , a pair of adidas adistars ( the newest model is a very good shoe but did n't fit my wider foot properly ) , and some various pairs of new balance ( least favorites of the bunch ) but the mizuno wave 7 's are by far the most natural feeling , durable , light-weight , cushioned ( without being bulky ) shoe i have ever owned . i have now owned two of the wave creation 7 's and a pair of the older wave creation 6 's and put a lot of miles on these shoes : they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there . the gel kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but i found that they break down far to fast for distance running ( and they are slightly heavy ) . that and the mizuno 's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare . i am confident i could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference . i would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but i endorse it as the only shoe i will buy as long as the line continues .
1	this is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when i want something dressy . it is a very pretty little bag .
1	great product , works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description ... .thank
1	i got this jacket when it was $ 50 . i was very impressed at the quality and i like how it 's waterproof so i can just walk in the rain with it . great jacket and i think i will be wearing it for a long time
0	i bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material . the footbed/sole is not cork like true birks , but some sort of composite ( rigid ) . birk straps are softer and birk corkbeds are more cushiony . i wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so . too bad because after that i knew i did n't like them . i tried on a pair of birk granada ( the style this is based on ) and immediately felt the difference . while these are about 30 % -50 % cheaper , i would have rather spent more on the original birks . i think these wo n't hold up as long and do n't offer the same comfort . also , you can have real birks `` repaired '' so they never really wear out . **black version has large `` betula '' on side in white
0	this is definitely not something i would want to wear while working out . even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky , and the fabric does not appear to breathe . i 'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this . for cooler weather , i 'd prefer something like a good pair of tights ( sugoi for example )
1	my husband really likes the intimo men 's classic silk pants . they are very comfortable , and the color is really nice . he wears them almost every day ! the only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length
0	these pants are fine if you have a very short rise , but i ca n't imagine that they would fit most people . i will be returning my order
0	have n't worn it yet to test the quality however , the structure is all wrong . one leg is more narrow than than the other ( i could barely fit my leg into it ) and the waist is really high
0	i received the trousers in a timely manner . they were what i expected although they did not fit . i returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company .
1	this bra is great for those of us with smaller busts . it 's the only bra i 'll wear under my t-shirts now because it does n't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra i 've found . it very comfortable . the only downside is that mine did lose it 's form ( it 's not as tight fitting as it used to be ) a little bit faster than some other bras . but , it 's absolutely worth buying a replacement . i just hope they never stop making this bra
1	i bought these boots when they were on sale . definitely worths the money ! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in , and they are really comfortable . whoever saw my boots loved them
0	i did n't like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i do n't like it it 's feels it 's for old ladies
1	i bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them ! they fit great , they arrived in great condition and very quickly . the rhinestones are really blingy in the sun ! i am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also . very cute for the price
0	this wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from brazil . maybe is good for another country`s document
0	i ordered these based on the picture -- -a high cut brief . these are not the ones they sent me and now i have to pay to return them ! rip off ! ! ! zero stars
1	we loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo . old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them . they are so easy to get on him , and we all know some are so difficult . these slide right on while pulling the tongue . they are also wide enough for his `` flinstone '' feet , lol . they break in well for flexibility too .
0	when the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing . i called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece . i would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces
0	i bought these for a bridal shower gift . they say one size fits all but they where like an xxxsmall . they torn right when they where tried on . very poor quality ! ! ! ! do not buy these
0	the shoes would have been awesome but ... .. the sizes run extremely small . i even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen . the shoes are still too small .
0	i just received this dress today . not only was it cheaply made ( there are rhinestones missing , threads , and it does n't flow smoothly ) , the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight . also , the support is badly made . i have a very small bust , but i do n't think this would compliment anyone who is n't built like barbie . definitely would n't recommend . it looks great in the picture , but it 's not being modelled on a real person .
0	i have goddess bras , and it seems that each style has it 's own sizing . the love at first sight bra fits wonderfully , while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be
1	these jeans are extremely soft and comfortable . like most children 's place merchandise the quality is nice and cut a little larger then other brands . my only negative thought is that the material should be a little thicker . my boys are tough on their clothes
1	sexy and well made . i am a size 12 , but i bought the queen size and it fit great
0	the plastic screen on this case was very hard to keep clean , and very easy to scratch , so the view quality was horrible . also , the case was way to tight and was difficult to get the 30gb video ipod in and out
