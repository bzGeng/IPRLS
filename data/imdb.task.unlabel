yeti deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made .  i saw it at a midnight screening in l . a .  and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does !  the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill-fitting suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen - and yes ,  there is a mute boy  ( who sorta kinda looks like a girl )  and he's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents  ( hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid ?  ?  )  .  then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti  ( once he thaws - which takes forever )  -- and he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes  " bedroom eyes "  at her - it's like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie .  in fact ,  once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the yeti's nipple and yes ,  the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard !  !  !  !  yikes of all yikes !  plus there's a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie - there's also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl's hair  " gee ,  thanks yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout .  you're the best .  "  this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up .  if you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out . 
this film is absolutely hilarious .  basically ,  the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some b-movie chemical accident .  he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals .  its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him .  its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows ,  but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish .  the improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic ,  and this is clearly the intention - its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point .  alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death ,  and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film .  fantastic tacky fun
i was lucky enough to get a dvd copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time .  the 1st time was on late night tv in australia more than 20 years ago but i could never forget this strange and bleak film .  .   not many people like this film at all because it is so unconventional - the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move - we just hear the thoughts of characters - is only one unconventional aspect of it .   searching for a copy of this film i found out that the producer was dead ,  the main actor was dead ,  it was not kept in any british tv or film archives ,  that it was never released on video or dvd ,  that television networks around the world trashed it after their copyright ran out in the 80's .  when it was first shown on tv in australia there were no recordable devices for consumers .   on the second viewing recently ,  i could see why it was unforgettable .  at times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic very like a harold pinter stage play .   again ,  if anyone wants a dvd copy of this please email me and i'm sure we can work something out regards adam  ( whiteflokati@hotmail . com ) 
the point of wolfe's original novel -- indeed the point of the whole story -- is that things take place because of a carefully calculated sense of expediency .  the goal is survival within a particular kind of life style .  the novel is full of malice .  the only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between sherman and his daughter ,  campbell ,  and that's only touched upon .  that aside ,  everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity ,  power ,  money or self aggrandizement .   wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of new york city over the head .  his response was a denial .  after all ,  he lived in new york himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations ,  exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked new yorkers .   ( wolfe has a phd in american studies from yale and is no dummy .  )  those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable .  nobody was any good .  and sherman mccoy wound up broke ,  a professional protester for social justice .  the movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply doesn't fit .  wolfe did his homework .  the novel was rooted in reality .  every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable .  wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist -- he knows how to get inside a system and record its details .   yes ,  any of us might have found ourselves ,  as sherman and his mistress do ,  stuck in the south bronx ,  threatened by a couple of black kids ,  and making a getaway after bumping into one of them .  that scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid .    but after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message ,  however nebulous the message is .    sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel ,  but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo ,  take out a shotgun ,  and start shooting into the ceiling with it ,  as he does in the movee .  in what's supposed to be a funny scene ,  ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away ,  shrieking .  it simply would not have happened .  the movie has left the novel's unspeakably detailed reality in the dust .  wolfe's sensibility ,  the work he put into capturing the real ,  has been lost .  what we get instead is a noisy ,  fantastic ,  and silly scene that doesn't do anything except wake the audience up .  similar empty scenes follow ,  screaming out for wolfe's verisimilitude .   the movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism .  here we see  " don juan in hell "  at the opera .  we get lectures on redemption from a poet with aids .  we see a lot of guilt in sherman .  a black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again .  a reporter who feels sorry for sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb .  and a happy ending in which sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin .  the scene sits on the movie like a jester's cap on a circus elephant's head .    the movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal ,  it overstates them ,  as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties .   it's not the acting or the direction that's poor .  the film's not bad in those respects .  and the photography is pretty good too ,  including two rather spectacular shots -- the gargoyles of the chrysler building and the landing of the concorde .  it's the script that is thoroughly botched .   the first half of the movie ,  roughly ,  is okay in conception and execution .  it keeps some of the little details from the novel .  sherman and judy's dog is named marshall .  who the hell would name a dog marshall ?  it loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching .   wolfe's cynical redneck right-wingism may be offensive to a lot of people ,  but he's got the cojones to lay his percepts out .  alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of new yorkers . 
when i rented this movie ,  i had very low expectations .  .  .  .  .  . but when i saw it ,  i realized that the movie was less  ( a lot less )  than what i expected .  the actors were bad  ( the doctor's wife was one of the worst )  ,  the story was so stupid .  .  . it could work for a disney movie  ( except for the murders )  ,  but this one is not a comedy ,  it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity .  the title is well chosen except for one thing :  they could add stupid movie after dead husbands !  i give it 0 and a half out of 5 . 
in a famous essay he wrote about charles dickens ,  george orwell points out that many readers always regretted that dickens never continued writing like he did in pickwick papers :  that is ,  he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career .  this would not have been too difficult for dickens .  his contemporary robert surtees did precisely that ,  only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set  ( mr .  fancy romford's hounds is a title of one of his novels )  .  among hunters and horse lovers surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable .  dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man  ( and don't forget ,  his first book ,  sketches by boz ,  was also a funny book )  .  so dickens third book is oliver twist  ( which got pretty grim at points )  .  orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books .  dickens would definitely  ( and successfully )  have agreed to that .   but orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows .  surtees ,  as i said ,  is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting .  but p . g . wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer ,  poking fun at the upper reaches of the british social system .  his earl of emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in england than being .  .  . well earl of emsworth !  his psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior .  his stanley uckridge will always have a  " perfect "  scheme that should net a huge profit  ( but always manages to come apart at the end )  .  and best of all ,  his jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept bertie wooster ,  his boss .  since wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow .  they served  ( and still serve )  their purposes .  in fact ,  compared wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary evelyn waugh ,  who also wrote funny books ,  but of a more intellectual type .  the best of waugh remains among the high points of 20th century british literature :  brideshead revisited ,  decline and fall ,  and the rest .  but in his determination to make his points ,  if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed .  for every vile bodies there was some failure late in his career like the ordeal of gilbert pinfold .  while wodehouse could do lesser hack work too ,  his falling did not go as far as waugh's did .   wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist  ( when you hear  " bill "  in the score of showboat ,  it is not kern and hammerstein's tune ,  but kern and wodehouse's tune transposed from  " oh lady ,  lady "  a dozen years earlier )  .  he was a handy dramatist too .  so it is pleasing to see that he took his novel a damsel in distress and turned it into the screenplay here .   it has the normal wodehouse touches .  that perfect butler keggs  ( reginald gardiner in a wonderful performance )  is a scoundrel in rigging a  " friendly "  gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads .  he is also unable to refrain ,  occasionally ,  from singing italian opera - despite constance collier's attempts to control his impulse .  this is typical wodehouse characterization .  so is the way the love affair between lady alyce and jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of keggs and young albert ,  both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash .  wodehouse always does that type of plot switch ,  with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest .   wodehouse was also lucky here to have burns and allan to work with .  it is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together  ( such as six of a kind and we're not dressing )  george and gracie did their best support with fred astaire .  the fun house sequence ,  which includes the song  " stiff upper lip "  ,  is wonderful ,  as is an earlier sequence where the three do a  " whisk broom "  dance  ( that astaire learned from burns )  .  but gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by wodehouse in scenes with gardiner  ( see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only albert happens to notice keggs/gardiner's mistake ,  and looks at gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad )  .  her dialog with lady caroline  ( collier ) 's son reggie  ( ray noble ,  the british band leader ) leading him to imagine that he will marry her ,  but saying goodbye to gracie as she drives off with george to get married is wonderful too .   the film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of ginger rogers in it ,  and the weakness of joan fontaine .  fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role ,  but the flaw is really wodehouse's - he didn't make the character very interesting .  but the film can stand without that ,  given the other performers and their characters ,  gershwin's music ,  and wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun . 
first this deserves about 5 stars due to acting  ( some which would give me a better subjective opinion and not an objective one as it should by giving this one ,  well deserved ,  star )  but then i know that those facts are used for the actor ( s )  names to increase the rating of something like this .  .  .   i do have a problem with such productions ;  yet another attempt  ( just like  " untraceable "  )  of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights (  how interesting that it comes at a moment when ips providers trying to  " preferentiate "  = censor information ,  and the americans and canadians are fighting against that at this very moments )  .  this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil  (  that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net )  ,  but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole .  seems like fear promotion is hollywood's norm this days ,  especially when coming to thrillers which is the most  " on demand "  motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so = most viewed ,  best way to try influence the society as a whole .  such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and  " ethical "  people ,  that it gives a new much needed meaning to  " anti-heroes "  figures .  make no mistake  ,  this is not  " dexter "  which was meant to be high-quality entertainment . stop selling  " fear "  please ,  the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it .   the opening scene and generally the first 10 minutes really give a frightful picture of an erroll babbage that is clearlly suffering of sexual frustration .  the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist ( for sure a  " cliche "  at least )   (  in real life someone would probably get a beating for it ,  you will see what i mean )  .  the second scene  (  with claire danes's character present )  is even more extreme .  at that point i realized ,  in my opinion that erroll babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him . how many people ,  that have seen or will see this movie ,  have never been  " hold down "  ( regarding both sexes )  out of self ,  common gratification !  ?  . typically the movie gives an extreme criminal case ( that unfortunately did ,  is and will likely happen again sometime  ,  somewhere )  but fingers everyone else indirectly as well as  " you could become that "  ,  etc .  anyone that is familiar with sigmund freud and jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone  " asses "   ,  by such fanatical  " hero "  here .  safe sex in its many forms is healthy and not some evil that apparently richard gere character is obsessed with  ,  on his way for some sexual  " crusade "  .  have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys !  ?  or for how long an american teenager can see extreme violence on  " pg-13 "  but he can not even see a woman breast until  " r-18 "  !  ?  !  ?  (  yet the industry targets them with this very same sexual perversions like  " american pie "  series for example )  . raise the kids tester-one levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to unhealthy extremes !  ?  all sexual activities ( upon mutual acceptance )  integrates individuals better then some  " rightous "  nut-case ,  that blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on  " the lives of others "  (  a new german movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject )  . here ,  like in that movie ,  you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been .   i am very disappointed with richard gere especially after the recent  "  hunting party "  ,  a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic  " hero "  (  after real facts as well )  . but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone's political and social agenda .   " the flock "  and  " untraceable "  2 heads of the same hidden beast )  )  ) it just reminds you ,  if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a whole ,  as erroll babbage has those here ,  to stay clear of them for their own safety . they would kill my family faster then any 0 . 00001 chances of paul jerrod in anyone's life would .  .  .   in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about my  " assesment "  of this particular movie  (  and  " untraceable "  actually )  ,  so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did .  nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the  " foot "  .  )  )  )  ) for once i agree with the rating ,  this is not a feature for teenagers or kids ;  simply because at best would confuse them even more then the  " common "  belief of  " money+fame+fashion "  and how that relates to sexuality .   " scream "  series and movies as such at least have a defined entertainment value ( even if a dumb one in my opinion )  .  but this one is just another  " trust me i know what is good for you "  deeply  ( not so well done i might add )  subliminal messages . 
my friends and i rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile .  the movie is not supposed to be funny at all ,  but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever .  first ,  phillippe  ( i forget what his character is called and i don't really care )  uses his regular employee id to go through all the top-security terminals .  not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so-scary lego-room ,  which hosts the super computers .  this is plain funny .  the tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room .  the ending ,  like all else ,  is very very very cheesy ,  especially when the bad guy's lawyer shows up 'right on time' .  anyway ,  this movie is a good laugh .  if you need something to make fun of ,  definitely see it . 
there's some very clever humour in this film ,  which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors .  however ,  after a while it just seems an exercise in style  ( notwithstanding great gags such as balasko continuing the part of dussolier ,  and very good acting by all involved )  and i was wondering why blier made this film .  all is revealed in the ending ,  when blier ,  directing claude brasseur ,  gets a phone call from his dad  ( bernard blier )  - from heaven ,  and gets the chance to say how much he misses him .  an effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt .  but there isn't really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it's entire running time .  some really nice scenes and sequences ,  however ,  and anyone who likes these 'mosntres sacrés' of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film . 
the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in .  it is well made and very powerful .  the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective .  i believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society .  it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it .  some parts were difficult to watch ,  as most reality is ,  but it is not over done .  its good the first time you watch it ,  but it becomes even better the second or third time around ;  because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge . 
i really enjoyed this movie .  it succeeded in doing something that few movies do now ;  it provided family values while entertaining me .  nancy drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to .  the little girls i was with throughly enjoyed the movie and kept talking about nancy as we walked out of the theater .  the movie has relatively few problems for families and i don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater .  no ,  it won't win an oscar and it did not showcase magnificent special effects or even provide a horribly spooky mystery ,  but it entertained me and it stood true to the the spirit of the books .  i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody with a young girl  ( she will love it !  )  or any fan of the books .  you will not be disappointed . 
expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges ,  flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated .   it actually has a feminist storyline ,  though i don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set .  it certainly wasn't practiced .  women  ( and the jews and the poor )  are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society .  throughout the story ,  sister flavia  ( florinda bolkan )  witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it ,  albeit with disastrous results .   the pre-credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield .  she sees an injured  " evil "  muslim soldier  ( one of the few still alive )  and tries to assist him .  before she can ,  her hate-filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face  ( great family dynamics ,  huh ?  )  .  after this ,  her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice .  though scenes do involve violence ,  rape and nuns ,  i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation .    indeed ,  many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there ,  but the acting ,  camera-work ,  storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level .  most  " nun "  films i've seen usually have the basic premise of :  a good girl somehow winds up in a convent ,  where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell .   flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her .  much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-spirited  ( but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me ,  but it's a lot easier for guys )  sister agatha .  when a group of muslims attack their abbey ,  flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns .  their attackers actually function as their liberators  ( of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey )  .  in fact ,  it is a christian ,  not a muslim invader ,  that impales dear sister agatha .    it is agatha's death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her .  .  .  her father treats her like dirt .  her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time .  i don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story ,  but be prepared to be shocked ,  devastated and saddened at the conclusion .  this is a great film ,  so don't be put off by its  ( undeserved )  reputation as a trash epic .  plus ,  how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong ?  i am not familiar with maría casares' other works ,  but sister agatha is a hell of a character .   i have read many great reviews of the synapse  ( us )  release ,  but i love my german x-rated kult dvd copy .  it isn't anamorphic/16 : 9 ,  but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapse's release .   and there are also many great ,  wise or funny lines of dialogue  ( many from sister agatha )    " why is god male ?  the father ,  the son ,  and the holy spirit they're all male !  "  -flavia   " these men are afraid- look at them ,  sister- afraid their power will be taken away from them !  "  -sr .  agatha  ( regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrive )    " woman ,  where are you going ?  the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians haven't done !  ha ha ha !  "  -sr .  agatha  ( to a group of fleeing christian women )    " lord bless these moslems- for putting fear into these pompous christians .  "  -flavia   " does it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you $h ! t your underclothing ?  "  -sr .  agatha  closing message :   " flavia gaetani ,  not yet a muslim - no longer a christian - was punished as a runaway nun .  the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the 800 at otranto " 
i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend .  i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didn't feel very good .   i ended up liking it big time .  it's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship ,  unwanted betrayal ,  power ,  money ,  drug traffic ,  and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail .   the acting is on it's prime level .  two of the women that i lust the most star and that's a good thing .  claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance .  bill pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities .   there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience .  plus it shows the difficult times at thailand .   this is an underrated movie .  not many films like this one have come up in recent history .  it should make you reflex about many things .  .  . 
although i am generally a proponent of the well-made film ,  i do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries ,  and more often than not i do enjoy and admire films that successfully  " break the rules .  "  and it is quite true that director pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema .  but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point .   pasolini's work is visually jarring ,  but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed ,  and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography .  this is true of decameron .  pasolini often preferred to use non-actors ,  and while many directors have done so with remarkable result ,  under pasolini's direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors .  this is also true of decameron .  pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock ,  offend ,  or otherwise disconcert the audience .  such elements can often be used with startling effect ,  but in pasolini's hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film .  this is also true of decameron .   i have been given to understand there are many people who like ,  even admire pasolini's films .  even so ,  i have never actually met any of them ,  and i have never been able to read anything about pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me .  judging him from his works alone ,  i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not  " break the rules "  so much by choice as by lack of skill--and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for  "  existential boldness ,  "  thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker .  i find his work tedious ,  unimpressive ,  and pretentious .  and this ,  too ,  is true of decameron .  it is also ,  sadly ,  true of virtually every pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure . 
humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film ,  and be forced to play a part-mexican or he would have been suspended .  believe me  ,  he made the wrong choice !  presumably ,  after the success of  " dodge city "  ,  warners tried a follow-up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies ,  like alan hale ,  guinn  ( big boy )  williams ,  frank mc hugh and the ever-present john litel ,  but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v .  randolph scott ,  and as a singer to really make things bad ,  because she proved one thing ,  and that is she cannot sing .  the story was not too bad ,  but with bogie clearly miscast also ,  it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong ,  and on a low budget ,  but in fairness ,  color would not have helped . 
when setting out this film ,  director mary harron seemingly had the goal of clearly documenting the progress of bettie page's career ,  from early modelling days to leaving modelling to go back home after the senate hearings on juvenile delinquency and her religious rediscovery in the 50s ,  and so intent is she to get all of these facts on screen in the time allowed she seems to have missed out on taking any time to explain anything in depth .   when you think of someone who had page's career you'd think that there would be plenty to discuss ,  her reasons ,  decisions ,  life event ,  personal traumas ,  but harron avoids any kind of personal exploration of the character .  in the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse ,  domestic violence and a gang rape ,  but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again .  you get the impression that harron and guinevere turner  ( co-writer )  wanted to gloss over anything that wasn't glamorous and flattering .  you go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was ,  but all you are given is a list of things that she did and recreations of some of her most famous photo shoots .   all in all the film really frustrates you as you watch ,  desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself .  how did she balance her religion with her job ?  what made this young tennessee girl move from modelling into bondage photography .  the film simply shows her going to another modelling agency and putting on whatever she's told ,  but surely it would have involved some shock and deliberation ,  this was after all the 50s .   it seems to me that harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by today's standards  ( page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions )  and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous and although this is true ,  she never actually makes it seem sordid in the eyes of others .  today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it ,  but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience .  this woman was a central part of a senate hearing on juvenile delinquency ,  but no one is ever really shown as shocked .   basically i left this film just thinking how tame it was .  harron and turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer .  they come across as two lifelong fans of miss page and are desperate to make sure that nothing ,  absolutely nothing ,  could possibly put a bad light on their heroine ,  and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was .   ( before and after her career there are reports of her violent nature and mental problems )  and all that's left is the string of events that made up her career ,  without any substance whatsoever behind it . 
the first time i saw this film ,  i loved it .  it was different .   i am a christian  ( bible believing )  .  i don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers .  i dropped out of that atmosphere .   to me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what judas tried to do .  i call it the judas syndrome .   judas didn't get it ,  even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this world .   this film certainly showed some of that .   i also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples .   also he was a very gorgeous jesus .   it's a watch-over and over movie .   very satisfying . 
this seemed to be a good movie ,  i thought it would be a good movie ,  and throughout the movie i was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time ,  and yes ,  i have to admit that the acting talent of dimple kapadia and deepti naval where truly commendable ,  but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message ,  which it seems is it seemed was what somnath sen is trying to do .  the final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens ;  a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied ,  if indeed that was the director's intention .  this falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most .   another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo-typing of the american characters - they all seem to be carved out of the same block .  seems to me that most american characters in indian english movies are based upon how common indians themselves perceive americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any american in the movie .   these two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story . 
we loved the movie .  i am a mother to two little men .  i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character .  moveis where money is not the most important thing .  and family's are forever and love means more then words .    i do wish we saw more of the davis family .  but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did  " please don't be over "  .  we both wish actors would not change . the new actors were good replacement tho .   my 9 year old son loved this movie too .  asked me to go buy them all .  he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something .  family should all see this move buy it for friends  .  help bring back a time of values .  we will be reading the books now that we are hooked .  really hope to see more .  be blessed happy moving
wow .  i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast .  justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had .   his acting was painful to observe .  the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors ,  heck ,  even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on .  how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend .   his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass ,  and he is supposed to be the hero .  .  .  i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video .  maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at 2am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned ,  this may be ok .   watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'kermit the frog' act in a hollywood blockbuster ,  just didn't work at all . 
first saw this movie in about 1990 ,  and absolutely died laughing through it .  it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends ,  and we'd quote from it at the drop of a hat  (  " i'm going home in a bag !  "  )  .  needless to say ,  the humor is still there ,  15 years later .  it's become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film  ( good thing you can still buy it off ebay !  )  i've found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek .  . and this movie provides it all- pathos ,  suspense ,  unrequited love , nobility and the list goes on .  royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller .  i remember seeing him in  " the 7 faces of dr .  lao "  as a bad guy who met a bad end .  here ,  you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning .    if you aren't careful ,  you'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie .  the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments ,  little subtle costume digs at other sci-fi movies ,  and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e .  coyote !   don't spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie ,  people- this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking ,  and shouldn't be offensive to anyone  ( well ,  maybe stupid people ,  but they won't know they're being mocked .  .  )  .   -now if you'll excuse me ,  i'm gonna go get a 'zag-nut' bar .  .  .  .   -ramsay  " rc "  cowlishaw ,  karaoke dj/entertainer
the film adaptation of james joyce's ulysses is excellent .  the actors ,  the voice overs ,  the direction ,  it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits .  the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom ,  the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly .  i absolutely love this picture . 
i saw this film for the first time not too long on tcm's  " essentials "  series .  the eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos .  this beholder saw little of value in this one .  i was puzzled by the infinite attraction that lucy  ( lauren bacall )  possessed .  granted ,  ms .  bacall was a beautiful woman ,  but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive .  i would think men like mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her .  in bacall's defense ,  this film was made at the time of humphrey bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance .  of course part of this mousiness on the part of lucy was to contrast her to slutty marylee ,  played to the hilt and beyond by dorothy malone .  the scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film .  malone's performance outshines the rest ,  although jasper hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by robert keith .  generally ,  though ,  i would have to say that i'm just not much of a fan of melodrama .  the cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes . 
while on a vacation at the beach ,  red-haired brothers michael mcgreevey and billy mumy  ( as arthur and petey loomis )  find a seal .  the lads christen their critter  " sammy "  ,  and spend summertime frolicking with the sandy sea lion .  when it's time to go home ,  the boys begin to suffer separation anxiety .  young mr .  mcgreevey decides they can't take  " sammy "  back to  " disneyland "  er ,   " gatesville "  - but ,  young mr .  mumy packs him anyway .  at home ,  they try to hide  " the way-out seal "  from adults ,  and ,  of course hijacks ensue !    **** sammy - the way-out seal ,  pt 1  ( 10/28/62 )  norman tokar ~ michael mcgreevey ,  bill mumy ,  robert culp
first off i want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars i rated it .  i gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all .  however ,   " the big alligator river "   ( the title my dvd calls it )  is better than your average nature strikes back movie .   a tourist resort in the jungles of southeast asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around .  mother nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god kroona ,  a giant alligator .  but the creature isn't the only thing the tourists and the main characters  ( a photographer and the resort staff )  have to worry about ,  the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too .   this movie is a pretty well-done adventure/horror story with a good musical score and direction .  but the alligator itself ,  the main attraction of the movie ,  is obviously fake looking .  some of the close-ups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see .  some of the underwater far-away shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeaky-toy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop .  but the natives are believable ,  if not authentic .   probably not the movie that will give you non-stop thrills ,  if any ,  but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention .  and like a lot of creature movies ,  this one ends with an extremely high body count .  it also has lots of good jungle scenery .  acting is below par though ,  but who was expecting it to be better ,  eh ?    much ,  much better than its recent american counterpart  " primeival "  but nothing to be compared with  " jaws "  .  but remember it may not be engaging at a few points . 
i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old ,  but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that .  the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies .  so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little .  i'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me .  all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and i'm shocked honestly by this rating of 5 . 8 ,  i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well .  i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun .   charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog ,  carface .  but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that can't stop ticking or that's the end of his life again .  when he and his best friend ,  itchy ,  look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money ,  he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races .  charlie takes the girl ,  ann-marie ,  and makes fake promises in order to get the money .  but he ends up learning that maybe he should put ann-marie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeance .   all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film ,  it's not disney ,  but this is an excellent family film to watch .  not to mention that it's just so cute and touching .  i know it's ridicules and some people call me crazy ,  but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls .  how could they not ?  they're just so loving ,  and i think i'm going to cry again .  but anyways ,  i would just recommend this movie for anyone ,  it's a fun movie to watch .   7/10
there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them .  this film shows it as it is .  it is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy ,  it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful .  i've only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel .  it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop .  this is what films should be about- they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong . 
this mess is so bad it doesn't even qualify as horror .    debbie rochon's talent is completely wasted in this film .  she is not even the villain .  the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i won't even mention it .   do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform  " better than sex "  it's total 80's disco candy song .  nice up tempo song about gambleing & sex .  way more entertaining than  " bleed "  .  put it this way ,  when one has the equipment to copy videos ,  but decides only to record the song at the end of movie ,  you have a really  " bad "  movie . 
yeah sure it's cheesy ,  it's not zombie ,  but it's not that bad either .  it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus ,  and it's entertaining .  i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience ,  as he was never completely satisfied with it .  it is well worth a search out ,  especially for genre and fulci fans .  it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand . 
i have been using imdb for years and i never wanted to get involved in the commentary of moviesuntil now .  this documentary has so many problems that i hardly know what to say .  i am not a muslim ,  nor am i an islamic studies expert ,  but i know enough to shed some light on the obvious one-sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses .    the problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary .  most of the documentaries that i have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation .  this is certainly the case with islam :  what the west needs to know .  yes ,  there are fundamentalists around the world ,  and some of them are muslim ,  but to build a documentary about all of islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading .  this is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of islam and nothing more .   for those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary ,  here are several points that may help .    there was nothing positive about islam presented in the documentary .   the documentary focuses on the middle east ,  but more muslims live outside of that region .  more muslims live in china ,  believe it or not ,  than in saudi arabia .  about 40% of all muslims live in pakistan ,  bangladesh ,  india and indonesia .   the translation of the qur'an used in the documentary is a questionable one .  i watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking .  i had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now i know why .  surrah 98 : 6 is a good example .  the documentary suggests that the surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell .  but the translation i have reads instead :   " those who reject truth among the people of the book and among the polytheists will be in hellfire .  "  the difference is that those who reject truth are those people who know about god and the truth of god and decide to reject it anyways .    the movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in islam ,  but this is not true .  although it is true that much comes from the qur'an and hadith ,  islam also recognizes a concept called 'urf or  " normative behavior .  "  obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways ,  but 'urf is meant to be  " good "  behavior ,  what an average person would consider right or wrong .   the documentary presents shar'ia  ( islamic law )  as being one unified body of knowledge that all muslims follow .  this is simply not true .  there are many islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law .    the hadith tradition is similar .  there are thousands of hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others .  using the hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate ,  real and applicable ,  is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say which is what the documentary did .   what i hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem ,  not islam or any other religion .  christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on .  i know this is not the same as suicide bombing ,  just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem .  if you feel you have the answer ,  then everyone else must be wrong .  but if you feel you have an answer you can work together with other people's views about politics ,  religion ,  god ,  or whatever . 
the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault ,  with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in 1959 ;  this film is a sweet ,  enchanting masterpiece from disney .   the film has a great soundtrack ;  that's one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack ,  and i love the songs too ;  my favorite song is the romantic  " so this is love .  "  i love the mice from the film too ,  they are cute .  my favorite scene is the scene after the narration ,  the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning ;  i also love it when cinderella's animal friends  ( the mice and birds )  fix up cinderella's birth-mother's dress ,  so she could go to the ball .  .  . until drizella & anastasia tore it to bits ,  the b****es ! 
i'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars .  the line about  " have you even seen the wizard of oz "  was the best part for me !  with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows .  do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game ,  your gonna be glad ya did ! 
gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast ,  a television reporter who travels with her crew  ( karen lamm and lois young )  to solvang ,  california ,  to cover a danish festival .  the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full .  so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller  ( a phenomenal sydney lassick )  .  wouldn't you know it ,  ernest and meek partner virginia  ( lelia goldoni )  are hiding a big secret in their cellar :  pitiable ,  deformed ,  diaper-clad  " junior "   ( stephen furst ,  in a remarkable performance )  who ultimately terrorizes the girls .   a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie .  it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax ,  delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour .  the hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echoes of  " psycho "  here - are great settings .  most of all ,  the perverse plot involves incest and patricide ,  allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality .  and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls .  the final shot is especially sad .    " the unseen "  is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery .   8/10
what a let down !  this started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters .  admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail ,  but i was nevertheless gripped and kept watching .   david morrissey is always good value and he suranne jones were good leads .  the muslim aspects were very interesting .  we were tantalised with possible terrorist connections .   but then morrissey's character was killed off and all the air left the balloon .  the last episode was dull ,  dull ,  dull .  the whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the dénouement was unbelievably feeble .   five hours of my life for that ?  my advice :  watch paint dry instead . 
cowboys james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to alaska and on into canada to stake a claim .  once there ,  they have to contend with seductive ,  shifty businesswoman ruth roman and ice-cold ,  happy-go-lucky villain james mcintire .   john wayne may get talked about more ,  but his good pal stewart made some excellent ,  hard-edged westerns too ,  some with the great director anthony mann .  frankly ,  i'd take this ,  with it's sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama ,  over north to alaska any day !   the far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreen .   also ,  there's some strong support by the always reliable brennan ,  roman  ( who's great )  ,  the incredibly cute corrine calvet ,  and james mcintire ,  who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy ,  the kind that doesn't take himself too seriously .   this would make a great double-bill with another highly recommended mann/stewart northwest-set western ,  bend of the river . 
while rome goes mad celebrating hitler's visit - uniforms ,  bands ,  parades - two outsiders stay home ,  in a large building ,  and wind up meeting .  she is sofia loren ,  who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children .  he is mastroianni ,  a radio speaker who's been fired because of his homosexuality .  both of them need company and understanding ,  both f them find it in each other .   the movie covers a span of a few hours .  the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers .  strangely enough ,  the nazi anthem - the horst-wessel-lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme .   beautiful movie ,  excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching ,  sad story .  mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and sofia loren does a superb job ,  very far away from her usual truck driver's pin-up ,  neapolitan fishwife personas .  don't miss it . 
the first time i ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad .  my dad actually recorded it off the tv .  i must have watched is over 20 times ,  before the relatively recent release on dvd .   i of course bought and watched the dvd and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed .  in the first version ,  which i still have on vhs ,  the mood of the film ,  thanks to the dialogue ,  was actually very dark .  however the new version ,  featuring van der beek et al ,  is more comic .   to put it another way ,  it's like watching the original us release of akira with that dub ,  before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the japanese .   i'm in no way complaining ,  the story and quality of animation are not detracted from ,  but it does raise the question of whether miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film .  .  .  .  . 
after watching this i thought to myself ,  there are either too few good writers & directors or lots of producers .   at any rate ,  this is a terrible movie .  terrible in a way that it's not fun ,  but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver .  makes you shout  " this is wrong "  at the movie .  immersion is zero .  by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors/weirdness-es in movies that has computers hackers etc .  in them .  this movie is like that in every aspect .    the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily ,  brilliantly played by eliza bennett .  i hope she becomes big ,  and make this  .  . thing at least worth something .   do yourself a favor .  don't watch this .  there is not even proper action in it .  total waste of time . 
sorry this movie did not scare me it just annoyed me .  it was just so frustrating when i saw the potential and that ,  all that ,  fell by the wayside .  the children !  the father !  the premonition !  had so much potential and ziltch !  zero ,  nada !  i have heard it all before .  scary !  no !  i can scare myself alone ,  here where i sit ,  than they could in the movie .  are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying ?  huh ?  this movie was quite atmospheric .  or at least it could have been ,  had the director/writer bothered to work it .  we could have had some good music that would have added to the tension too ,  if someone had made the effort .  what i really want to know is why do they get the money ?  just give it to me and save all that hassle .  abandoned ?  .  .  .  no we where betrayed
my take :  a tired formula christmas comedy .  the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too .   i love the holidays as much as the next guy  ( even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues )  ,  but it seems it's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year ,  but that doesn't make them any less painful during the season .  as if we already had enough santa clause movies  ( three and *gulp* still counting )  ,  who wants to see a movie about his brother ?  in a plot that would be at home with disney's santa clause franchise  ( save the occasionally crude humor and santa's  " little "  helper wearing a short skirt )  ,  fred claus is a one-joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes .  sure ,  jolly ol' saint nick has a brother ,  but where does it go from there ?    it's a shame really .  fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow ,  but it would have been so much better than this .  vince vaughn is your typical snob ,  but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never-aging santa  ( paul giamatti )  ,  who invites his good ol' brother to visit .  mrs .  claus  ( miranda richardson )  is reluctant ,  and worse ,  an efficiency expert  ( kevin spacey )  has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas ,  and his this close to being shut down .  hah !  and guess who plays santa's mother !  kathy bates of course .  elizabeth banks is santa's helper charlene ,  john michael higgins is one of the elves ,  and rachel wiesz plays fred's girlfriend !  si don't know if i'd praise the casting or to bash it .  here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality ,  but they're given way too little to work with .   as for humor ,  the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf .  i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers  ( where he is joined by stephen baldwin ,  roger clinton and frank stallone )  ,  but the giggles begin and end there .  worse still ,  the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that's supposed to make us  " feel good "  and teach us a lesson about  " what christmas really means "  .  apparently ,  what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can .   rating :  ** out of 5 . 
i just saw this recently ,  after an interval of nearly forty years .  it holds up well ,  especially lionel bart's outstanding songs .   (  " who will buy "  with it's magical counterpoint ,  just one of many standouts .  )   i disagree with the other post that decried its g rating .  the ratings system ,  brand new at the time ,  never intended the g  ( general )  rating to mean  " completely devoid of conflict "  .   characterizing it as unsuitable for kids reminds me of the description i once saw of the wizard of oz :  a girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she encounters .  she then goes on a road trip with three male companions and kills again . 
this movie could have been great ( cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise )  but it never rises above sheer caricature .  the acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i cringed so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater .  never and i mean never watch this godawfull piece of  .  .  .  .  danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of  .  .  .  .  crosses the border i'm afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie .  this movie is the reason why i chose to register here .  i really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of  .  .  .  .  my sympathies go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
this is a thriller with a good concept ,  good acting ,  good photography and good intentions all around ,  but which is confused and disjointed in execution .   garcia stars as john berlin ,  an l . a .  forensic detective who has moved to a small california town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there .  he soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in .  the known victim is theorized to be blind ,  which leads to a romance with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind .   despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where i found myself wondering ,  'how the hell did we wind up here ? ' or 'how did we find this out ? ' i found it confusing and disjointed ,  despite the good acting ,  etc .  john malkovich has a small part toward the end as an f . b . i .  investigator out to get berlin .   not recommended . 
jammin' the blues is an oscar-nominated short from 1944 that is basically 10 minutes of improvisational jazz played in one long jam .  marie bryant sings  " the sunny side of the street "  at one point for the film's highlight then jitterbugs with archie savage to bring this most entertaining  " jam session "  to its exciting end .  the director gojn mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that makes this one of the most innovative angles of the '40s .  according to some notes i read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette in reflection of the social attitudes of the time .  what a shame .  still ,  this most unusual film of the time is available on youtube so if you love jazz ,  i suggest you seek it out there . 
this is an awesome action film with great one liners from arnie !  .  it's stylishly made ,  with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied .  the characters were awesome ,  and richard dawson ,  is very menacing as the main villain .  yes it has tons of plot holes , however it's highly highly entertaining ,  with a great ending as well .  it had a great story ,  too it ,  and arnie and maria conchita alonso had great chemistry together .  the character development was also pretty good ,  with ,  some superb performances .  the directing is great !  .  paul michael glaser ,  does a very good job here ,  with awesome use of colors ,  keeping it stylish throughout ,  awesome camera angles ,  and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace !  good job .  there is a little bit of gore .  we get a few bloody gunshot wounds ,  exploding head ,  slit throat ,  bloody chainsaw slices ,  skinless corpses ,  blood ,  and an impaling .  the acting is great !  .  arnold schwarzenegger is amazing as always ,  he is excellent in the acting department  ,  has tons of hilarious one liners ,  kicks that ass ,  and as always is a big physical presence !  ,  and was tons of fun to watch !   ( arnie rules !  )  .  maria conchita alonso ,  does well here ,  she was really cute ,  and had good chemistry with arnie !  .  yaphet kotto ,  is decent here ,  with what he has to do ,  which is not much .  marvin j .  mcintyre ,  is good as the geeky type guy ,  he was cool !  .  richard dawson is awesome as the main villain ,  and was very very menacing ,  and he was fun to watch .  jesse ventura , jim brown , erland van lidth , gus rethwisch , and professor toru tanaka ,  all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers .  overall a must see !  ****1/2 out of 5
this might contain a spoiler ,  so beware .   if it had been 200 , 000 thousand or two million people ,  does it make a difference ?  sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of  ( strangely very loud )  americans ,  but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone .  god help us for what we have done .  after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans ,  and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race ,  you would think we'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's .  but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us .  how then ,  can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will ?  we are contradictory and hypocritical ,  and i am ashamed for this .  i feel sorrow for the people affected .  they deserve justice and their homes back .  if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety ,  i don't want it .  i denounce these actions ,  and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of deceit .  no one is above the law .  i want my country back ,  and so do the chagos islanders .  regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers ,  no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports .  we can't stand to be stuck in traffic ,  let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes .  'not one of us ,  brit and american alike forget what goes around comes around .  don't buy into the fallacy that a simpler ,  more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed ,  and preserved - when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and dignities of 2000 ,  we turn away from the basic human rights and dignities of all men . 
i've always thought that cinderella ii was the worst movie i've ever seen ,   ( followed by peter pan 2 ,  and some other sequels like the lion king 2 and the hunchback of notre dame 2 )  .  all these movies are made with the same idea ;  because the movie has no plot ,  they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes .  i'm not saying the jokes are bad ,  but they make up most of the movie .  the first time i saw the movie ,  i would have given it a 1/10 .  but now i think about it ,  most kids don't care how good the original movie was ,  they just care that the movie is entertaining .  i still think the movie was a bad sequel ,  but that doesn't mean it's horrible .  now i think it deserves a 3/10 . 
some people might call  " paulie "  a kids' movie ,  but i wish to assert that it's more than that .  probably more than anything else ,  this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states - topical given the recent debates .  portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor  ( tony shalhoub )  of how he searched america for his original owners ,  the movie tells several stories .  there's the elderly woman  ( gena rowlands )  whom he befriends ,  then a mexican immigrant  ( cheech marin )  ,  and others .   all in all ,  it's a very well done movie .  i usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies ,  but this one is a treat .  i certainly recommend it .  also starring jay mohr ,  buddy hackett ,  bruce davison ,  hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado . 
as a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie .  there are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does .  i would love to know if brian does his own riding in the film .  would also like to know if he enjoys horses .  brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden .  where did he learn to ride ?  the only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full tilt ,  like a horse can run forever at full steam .  the camera-work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse .  it would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good horseback riders . 
although the actors were good ,  specially fritzi haberland as the blind lilly ,  the film script is obsessively pretentious and completely arbitrary .  a famous theatre director  ( hilmir snær guðnason )  ,  becoming blind after a car accident ,  is on the run for himself and his destiny .  lilly ,  being sightless since her birth ,  is teacher for blind persons ,  and wants to make him  " seeing "  again .   ( blind persons are seeing with their fingers ,  nose and ears .  )  here this movie is becoming a roadmovie ;  and the longer the road becomes ,  the closer their relation develops ,  which was predictable since the beginning of the film .  the theatre director is on the road to his mother  ( jenny gröllmann )  .  his mother is living somewhere in russia on the sea and making artistic installations - of course ,  what should she do other !  - and she is still living ,  because she is waiting his son ,  to die .  my god !  this are destinies !   finally the son arrived !  mum is celebrating a big party !  at the beach .  wind is blowing and a pianist is playing on a real piano in the middle of a dune .  yes ,  they are celebrating her farewell .  the son arrives just in time .  mother can finally swallow the pills administered by a pretty nurse .  now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son ,  speaking sad contemplations about live in perfect german ,  while the son is answering with a rough accent .  because the son is unable to see ,  he is not falling in love to the nurse ,  - the film script would have become also too complicate !  - but is looking for lilly on the way back to home .   parallel to this roadmovie the sister of lilly ,  staying at home is asking a gawky schoolmate to deflower her ,  who has first to booze himself to courage .  the occasion is favourable .  because mum  ( tina engel )  is on journey together with the lover of lilly ,  paul  ( harald schrott )  .  they are after lilly ,  to bring her back .  paul and the mother of lilly are not falling in love ,  because the film script would have become too complicate .  the film script missed to make out of paul something exceptional too .  i would suggest an architect or a pianist ,  or course a famous one !  when they finally find lilly ,  they want to convince her ,  to come back to paul ,  because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her .  but lilly felt in love to his pupil ,  the theatre director ;  did i mention ,  that he was even a famous theatre director ?   this is german film art !  as you may see in this pretentious production ,  that the german film subsidy fund is not always producing good films ,  because they subsidy just such kind of pseudo intellectual films .  this film is really embarrassing .  i have the impression ,  that the film script has been cobbled together from some highbrows in coffee shops and restaurants .  everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea .  probably also til schweiger has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit ,  being a co-producer .  i was reminded by this film script to an other german film of absolute painfulness :   " barfuss "  - already the spelling of the title is not right !   " barfuss "  dvd cover writes proudly :   " a til schweiger film "  .  this film got also subsidies of filmstiftung nrw ,  filmförderung hamburg and the ffa .   please don't spoil your time with this film !  there are really good films in germany .  watch out for film directors like marcus h .  rosenmüller ,  joseph vilsmaier ,  hans steinbichler ,  hans-christian schmid ,  faith akin  .  .  . 
victor mclaglen ,  the title character of john ford's the informer ,  reminded me of the circus man from fellini's la strada .  anthony quinn played the brutish man ,  who may have even been influenced by the pug-faced ,  oscar-winning performance given by mclaglen .  poverty-stricken dublin is the true-life ,  atmospheric setting of the picture ,  which takes place in 1922 .  dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep irish patriotism and the fight of the irish republican army .  the conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes the informer tick .  mclaglen's large ,  simple character just wants to go to america and we're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently .  two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken irishman .  one is the previous ,  the other a wanted sign .  should he do it and get the money to go ?   john ford once famously said ,   " my name is ford .  i make westerns .  "  after seeing this film ,  he obviously could do a heck of a lot more .  the serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about .  and the look of the piece is amazing ,  consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable ireland night .  ford was always known for his luminescent ,  gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters .  this is hard in color ,  but he did it in pictures like the searchers ,  painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner .  victor mclaglen's performance not only benefits from the lighting ,  but by the sheer simplicity of his acting .  he shoves a lot .  he knocks people out .  he is a brute who knows no better .  he should ,  however ,  know whether or not to cross the ira .   see the film to find out the gritty details .  see it also for mclaglen and ford's patriotic portrayal of the ira .  max steiner's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters ,  placing more emphasis on them .  this was usually only seen in silent films ,  especially chaplin .  the topic of naming names or  " informing "  is obviously still important .  just look at how the media covered this year's oscars ,  giving much attention to the elia kazan scandal . 
touching ;  well directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer .  a love story with rabin's assassination in the background .  worth seeing  !   
ridiculous fluff ,  that compounds its error by trying to have meaning .  joan ,  this time as a congresswoman ,  agatha reed ,  chairwoman of a committee dedicated to  " investigating the high cost of food .  "  says congresswoman reed ,   " the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long .  i'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year ,  see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant .  "  she's all business ,  but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college ,  where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night  ( the parallel to joan's real life is unmistakable here ,  as it is in all joan movies )  .  the degree causes much consternation on campus  (  " that would make it the most broad-minded institution in the history of education !  "  )   but joan is unaware of this as she arrives .  the college president ,  jim merrill ,  played by robert young ,  at his handsomest ,  happens to be joan's former teacher  and lover .  it was with *him* that she spent the night out ,  all those years ago ,  but joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married .  naturally ,  this high-profile event will be covered by *life* magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be ?  yet another of joan's old lovers  this one ,  she hung out with in china  " during the war "  ,  and he thinks joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame .  eve arden ,  playing joan's assistant ,   " woodie ,  "  is at her butchest and most smart-alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job ,  if you didn't like her so much .  but you not only like eve in this ,  as in all her roles ,  you adore her .  she is so droll and no-nonsense ,  you'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys .  when joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater ,  eve tells her it  " looks fierce .  "  but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings ,  she ,  joan ,  sees youth  herself at 18  " eager ,  expectant  a little frightened ,  asking 'what is life ?  what am i ? ' "  but ,  of course ,  if we actually go into depth about joan at 18 ,  the truth may be a little different .    for me ,  this is the major problem in watching any joan movie .  you can call her characters whatever you want to ,  but it's always all joan ,  all the time .  so ,  since what we're always seeing is joan being herself ,  it's easy to dispense with character's names .  it's just that it gets confusing when joan tries to tell us something patently untrue ,  like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18 ,  joan had already been around the block several times .  many men would have described her as eager ,  and as far as being expectant ,  she had already had several abortions at this point .  but that's a personal problem ,  and i digress ,  but i simply wanted to explain why i say things such as  " and then joan does "  this or that ,  or  " we see joan as .  .  .  "  when we are not literally watching a home movie .   there is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which joan is given the clara bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that joan and clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe joan is much younger than she actually looks .  it fails .  what also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness .  in the story ,  joan has written a book about free speech and made a film  ( no ,  not the one about the plumber )  ,  and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical ,  dr .  pitt ,  who is about to be fired for his views ,  which are shockingly similar to joan's .  this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one ,  to be sure ,  but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion . 
i had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the 2006 vancouver international film festival .  i have been attending this festival for over 5 years ,  and i have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion .  however ,  'first bite' has reached a brand new low in film .  in spite of being shot in beautiful locations ,  with the occasional ,  exquisite close up of fabulous food ,  the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until i was practically begging for it to end .   the lead actor ,  david la haye ,  completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie ,  portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end .  additional sub-plots ,  such as eating disorders ,  were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that point .   a theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt to conceal a movie that achieves nothing ,  goes nowhere ,  and completely disappoints . 
i highly recommend this film .  set in the bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 paris ,  it is in most respect a classic film noir script :  lady in peril ,  sister trying to find her ,  honest cop fighting everyone .  luckily ,  it avoids being stereotypical ,  and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting ,  innovative visuals .  the film might remind you of sin city in look ,  but it has an even sharper ,  even more graphic novel look that i found really compelling .  each frame ,  each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer .  in terms of story and artwork ,  you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties  ( or even earlier with the classic views of the eiffel tower and sacre couer )  and movies like casablanca ,  as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations .  make any excuse you need to see this film . 
well ,  i guess i'll have to be the one to say  " the emperor has no clothes .  "  when i saw this show listed for pbs last night i was both hopeful and apprehensive .  i loved  " morse "   ( even going so far as to buy the complete dvd set )  and felt that ,  while i always liked kevin whately's sgt .  lewis character ,  the show was john thaw ,  period !  after watching the new  " inspector lewis "   ( as it is billed here )  ,  i am more convinced then ever that i was right .  .  . whately is fine  ( even though he looks awful  ( both badly aged and too fat )  ,  but he simply doesn't have the charisma to carry the show as did thaw .   and as for his  " sidekick "  fox ,  well .  .  . perhaps the reviewers here from england can understand what he's saying ,  but i for one mostly could not .   as for ms .  innocent .  .  . all i can say is that i miss james grout .   i'm sorry to say that they should have left  " morse "  rest in peace . 
wow ,  i just finally managed ,  after several attempts ,  to finish watching this god awful movie ,  only to learn that rick sloane and his production team have completed a straight-to-video sequel this year .   of all movies reviewed by mst3k--and they truly dig from the bottom of the barrel ,  screening the reputationally bad 'manos , ' 'werewolf , ' 'the incredibly strange , ' and the lesser know disasters like 'laserblast , ' 'zombie nightmare , ' and 'time chasers , '--this certainly has to be the absolute biggest pile of garbage they'd ever shown  ( which makes it perfect for riffing )  .  very simple ,  the movie is about a bunch of munchies-like gremlins on the loose ,  exploiting people's desires for fame ,  fortune ,  prowess ,  and of course ,  sex in ways that end up with people getting killed .  but this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous  ( a test of machismo ,  for example ,  is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools )  ,  the writing is so forced  ( such as the oft-described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it ,  if only she turned her head a quarter to the left .  .  .  and this isn't the first time in the movie this happens )  ,  and the story is so .  .  .  rarely given attention  ( hence the mst3k riff about a  " law in the future where films have to be made by filmmakers )  ,  that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen .  worst movie .  .  .  ever . 
cusack does his best david niven in this one ,  although i don't know if anyone besides me noticed it .   when seen with this in mind ,  its a deliciously over saturated 'wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty d*mn funny' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic .   hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond .  the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot - interesting choice .   i never knew how soothing montel's voice was until this movie .  .  .  i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs ! 
i didn't expect much from this tv movie .  you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr .  still ,  it managed to disappoint ,  failing even to be a good-bad film .   every scene was by rote ,  as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script ,  leaned back and said ,   " my work is done "  .  it's all cliche ,  all predictable ,  and ,  even worse ,  the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously ,   ( even when the plot developments are laughable )  .   do yourself a favor .  watch  " the x-files "  if you're in the mood for paranoia .  they handle it better .  also ,  let anyone know that sitting through  " fatal error "  is just that . 
entertaining jim belushi vehicle ,  a modern cockeyed version of it's a wonderful life .  michael caine plays a sort-of angel who lets belush see what life would have been like if he had  " made it big "  .  jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast ;  seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton .  not an oscar contender but good warm-hearted fun . 
assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release ,  i would have to say void this title at all costs .  unless you're bored of good ,  well-executed movies ,  that is .  i saw this last night at afi dallas ,  and i left with 20 minutes remaining ,  simply because i didn't care anymore  ( about the plot ,  not about insulting the director .  .  . that is awkward )  .  when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie  ( a shot out ,  shattered window before any shots are fired .  .  . and then the window breaks with the first shot )  ,  things are going to bad .  let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come .  .  . unfortunately .   i'll spare you all the details ,  but this is sub-par in every manner ,  even the half-assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him .  and the rape scene .  .  . christ !   " shut up and take it "  should never be used in a rape scene .  ever .   3/10
ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001 .  secondly the plot was all over the place ,  right off the bat the story is confusing .  had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better .  also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much .  it was bizarre and badly filmed .  the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd .  it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand .  i love chinese epic films but if you're looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise  ( visually stunning ,  the plot is interesting and good character development )  not this film .  beware you will be disappointed . 
t . z .  post ,  college professor ,  receives a false letter stating he inherited $750 , 000 .  now with financial means ,  he withdraws his life savings of $4 , 000 ,  and decides to finally going out & live .  after having his baggage sent on a train to chicago ,  he meets a traveling vaudeville troupe ,  and decides there good enough for him to put on a show on broadway .  the night of the show ,  poor prof .  post has to hide from his creditors ,  settle the relationship woes between girlfriend pansy and & floozy diva eleanor ,  and still make sure the show must go on .  after watching many of keaton's silent gems ,  this one is a pain to sit through ,  but i felt ,  it could have been a lot worse .  supporting cast durante ,  todd ,  & selwyn come off very annoying at times ,  but still likeable .  a pre-charlie chan toler is good as the frustrated show director .  90% of the script is badly written as mgm is trying to pass this off as a poor man's marx bros .  film where many of the sight gags fall flat from the beginning .  compiled with keaton's drinking problems at the time ,  this movie just is a sad moment in buster's life .  rating- 3 . 
*may contain spoilers*  i bent over backwards to be fair to this film .  i knew it starred madonna .  i knew it lasted a whole week in theaters .  i knew it got a lot of bad reviews .  i wasn't expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class ,  culture and sexuality like we got in the italian original .  the benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes .   madonna plays a rich ,  pretentious ,  nit-witted gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends  ( the brunette woman is as bad as madonna ,  exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions )  .  adriano giannini plays the ship's first-mate who the madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together .  why is she such a bitch to him ?  simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson .  just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two-thirds of the movie .    " swept away "  is a silly ,  simplistic ,  superficial movie from beginning to end .  madonna gives a typically wooden performance .  there are many dumb scenes :  madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of giannini ,  a fantasy scene with madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt .  guy ritchie does his  " stylish "  editing which is laughable here .  the film contains some of the worst dialog i've heard in a major movie in several years .  the ending is sappy and implausible .  it's basically  " the blue lagoon "  meets  " overboard "  minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter .   maybe madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress .  please give it up ,  madge ,  for our sake as well as yours .  this isn't her worst movie though .  that distinction still belongs to  " shanghai surprise "  .  she hasn't made anything worse than that .  .  . yet . 
as anyone old enough knows ,  south africa long suffered under the vile ,  racist oppression of apartheid ,  which completely subjugated the black population .  one of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was steve biko ,  who was murdered in jail .  following the murder ,  reporter donald woods sought to get biko's message out to the world .   in  " cry freedom "  ,  woods  ( kevin kline )  befriends biko  ( denzel washington )  before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges .  when woods attempts to spread biko's word ,  he and his family begin living under threat of attack ,  and they are finally forced to flee the country .  the last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters .   as one of two movies  ( along with  " a world apart "  )  that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement ,   " cry freedom "  stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved . 
without a doubt ,  12 monkeys is one of the best films of the sci-fi genre and director terry gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality .  an apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound ,  12 monkeys never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout .  excellent use of philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place .   bruce willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen .  he is actually sane ,  but the people of the future  ( or present if you will )  distort this guy's head so bad through time travel ,  no wonder he unravels .  he gets sent to world war i just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the army of the twelve monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it .  they finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance ,  we get to see willis ,  madeleine stowe and an ominous brad pitt cross-referenced over the course of 6 years .   stowe is sensual and solid as the risk-taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that willis may not be as cracked up as he seems .  a captivating element of the relationship between her and willis is their sense of  " seeing "  each other before ,  in another place or time .  12 monkeys is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present ,  when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world .   the brooding city of philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for willis' plight to complete his mission which is ,  against all usual hollywood stereotype ,  not to save the world .  he is gathering information .  the film plays tricks on the viewer as well ,  placing willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin .  this must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but gilliam seems to be the master of hard-boiled movie making .  he even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like time bandits ,  and brazil .  the screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films .  if you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy ,  see 12 monkeys .   rating :  9 of 10
this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush .  i realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by .  however if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding ,  this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing .  the plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add ,  many times before .  there is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others .  i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space .  in my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film .  what i've said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review ,  than for god's sake don't waste more time watching this movie .  the only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies that get played on the womens entertainment network at 2 : 00 a . m .  in that case go ahead see what i care . 
this movie is funny and painful at the same time .  the  " cinemagic "  almost gave me a seizure .  despite what they imply ,   " cinemagic "  is not some innovative technical procedure .  it was  " developed "  as the result of an accident ,  and they used it because it disguised the fact that their  " monsters "  were so stupid-looking .  i also don't think it's a coincidence that the writer is sid  " pink "  .   this movie is good for a laugh ,  if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days on 200 , 000 dollars .  it is entertaining ;  at least i can say that about it .  the bat/rat/spider is the highlight . 
films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning .  while there are some exceptions ,  the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes .  the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds ,  as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them .  in short ;  they're rubbish .  this isn't good considering that they're the leads ,  and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors .  it's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't  ( not completely )  .  it follows a young girl who ,  after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook ,  wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created .  it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings ,  and so sets about making various changes ,  until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare .  oh dear .   as you can see ,  this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie .  however ,  it is squandered through a number of fatal faults .  first and foremost ,  in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness ;  the movie is extremely stale .  the central plot is hardly played with at all ,  and the result is an entirely boring experience .  the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie ,  as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more  ( which is due to a lack of ideas )  .  thanks in part to it's lead characters ,  the film feels like a kids movie throughout .  this is to be expected as it stars kids ,  but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story ;  as the horror in the movie is laughable at best .  the film is also very cheesy ,  and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy ,  and makes for very painful viewing .  in fact ,  if i had to sum this travesty up in one word ,  i would choose 'painful' .  paperhouse is poorly acted ,  laughably plotted ,  very corny and dull on the whole .  save yourself the pain ,  see something else . 
i am one of jehovah's witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility .  over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions ,  have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens ,  and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood .  i have also heard several jehovah's witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen ,  leaving the question ,   " is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue ?  "  the issue for jehovah's witnesses is a moral one .   " you must abstain from blood "  is not an ambiguous statement .  thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it . 
the premise for circle of two is an intriguing one .  a forbidden love between a sixty year old painter ashleigh  ( richard burton )  and a fifteen year old girl sarah norton  ( tatum o'neill )  ;  and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given society's standards .  the problem with circle of two ,  however ,  is that it fails to live up to its promise .  director jules dassin and hedley should have put more thought into the screenplay .  when i watched this film ,  i expected to learn something new about love and sexuality .  instead ,  i got boring dialogue ,  a pointless lecture on art ,  outings where sarah seemed to have more fun away from ashleigh ,  and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost .  this script makes good actors look bad .  so one can imagine how the film's problems were compounded even further with the largely amateurish cast that jules dassin assembled .  tatum o'neill was not in her element .  i did not believe for a second that her character sarah was in love with ashleigh .  her performance seemed superficial ,  like a contestant at a beauty pageant .  it was as though she forced herself to be happy ,  when the script required her to be happy ,  and to be sad ,  when the script asked her to be sad .  the only scene i liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all .  that was probably the closest tatum's sarah norton ever came to being real .  but tatum was not the only one at fault .  richard burton's ashleigh lacked the charm ,  the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age ,  let alone a fifteen year old .  the rest of the cast was also dismal .  even their arguing was unconvincing ,  because they waited to take turns .  who does that ?  michael wincott as the jealous ex-boyfriend paul was probably the best thing in this film ,  but his role was small .  to be fair to the actors ,  dassin's direction let everyone down ;  but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script .  kubrick's lolita did that with james mason and sue lyon ;  konchalovsky's runaway train went beyond the script with jon voight and eric roberts playing convicts .  the directors of these films also knew how to use music to dramatize their films and reveal something about the characters in them .  in spite of its own score  ( a combination of antonio vivaldi ,  carl off and bernard hoffer )  ,  circle of two never succeeds in doing that .   in conclusion ,  the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one ,  but its execution in circle of two is terrible .  in many ways ,  it is a shame that a controversial ,  lolita-type story  which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid  did not have receive more intelligent treatment ;  that a script which actors would have gladly rehearsed was not written ;  that actors ,  who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real ,  could not be found ;  and that the director jules dassin  ( who did so much better with films like rififi and topkapi )  did not have to will to put his foot down and say ,   " before we do any filming ,  we must rethink the love story and revamp the script .  "  the only silver lining is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made .  if such a film ever appears ,  this it will be surely spark controversy ,  debate and questions for many years to come . 
firstly ,  i won't tell you why i rented this movie ,  as i'm still confused myself .  .  .   air rage is much like any movie i've seen where a plane is hijacked .  there is of course that one important person on the plane ,  and the hijacker looking for revenge .  the sad thing is ,  some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies .  are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly ?   although it's ice-t  ( who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at acting while he's not busy putting the  " c "  back in front of rap )  who is glorified on the cover ,  the movie actually stars the less than amazing kim oja as a stewardess who is 'surprisingly' overlooked by the five hijackers ,  which naturally comes back to haunt them .  as for the rest of the cast ,  the only person i managed to recognize was steve hytner ,  more commonly known as kenny bania from  " seinfeld "  .   i can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie ,  when a hijacker used about a pound of plastique to blow a lock off a door .  .  .  brilliant .   the plot was unnaturally predictable .   the script - atrocious .  it got to the point where i could say something ,  which i felt would make a stupid comment ,  and it would be the next line in the movie .   as for special effects .  .  .  the only thing special about this movie is that i wasted the cost of electricity to run my tv and vcr for 100 minutes .   and the title - the movie did take place in the air .  but due to the less than stellar performances ,  the only rage in the movie was that of the viewer .   so ,  if you're in the mood to even pick apart a movie ,  just because it's bad .  please save yourself ,  don't choose this . 
my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was .  after 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself .  it didn't .   i can't understand the praise given to this film .  the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time .   one thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines .  i understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness  ( like in happiness )  .  this was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing .  this film might actually be much better with subtitles ,  and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film ,  because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much .   i generally like these types of small quirky films  ( the real blonde ,  walking and talking ,  lovely and amazing )  ,  but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years . 
if this movie proves only one thing ,  it's that keaton is ,  was and always will be a comic at heart ,  even when dodging bullets ,  heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison .   but  " johnny dangerously "  goes on to prove even more .  in the '80s ,  the zaz boys  ( zucker ,  abrahams ,  zucker )  were the pinnacle in the world of genre spoofs .  but there were several pretenders to the throne .  this time ,  amy  (  " fast times at ridgement high "  )  heckerling tries her hand ,  with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script  ( go and check )  .    this slap-happy slapstick spoof of the 1930's cops-and- " gag " sters movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that didn't exist way back when .   and not only is the ever-dependable keaton on hand as the johnny of the title ,  but so are such funny guys and dolls as piscopo ,  henner ,  stapleton ,  boyle ,  dunne ,  devito ,  walston and just about every other actor in hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate vicinity .  you'd be surprised by how many faces you'll recognize .  i know i was .   and the jokes ?  well ,  when they start out ,  they come at you fast and furious ,  like a machine gun .  there are too many to count in the beginning ,  topped off with a crazy theme song by weird al yankovic .  but you have to watch for when they reload .  and they have to reload a little too often .    everyone tries ,  they seem to be having fun and i was laughing a good amount of the time .  in the end ,  though ,  there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier - not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy .   but for a slow night when there's nothing good on tv ,  pop in  " johnny "  and be ready for some  " dangerously "  serious laughter .   eight stars .  check out  " johnny dangerously "  .  .  .  don't be a  " bastidge "  . 
there seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since .  given the very low average rating given to the film by other people ,  i think you may draw your own conclusions .   this is a very bad film .  i'll admit it ,  i thought the concept was kind of cute ,  and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work ,  but it didn't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known .   acting :  the leads seemed competent enough ,  but everyone else ?  terrible .   plot :  chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through .   direction :  non-existent .   humour :  did they really think people were going to laugh ?  oh boy .   eye candy :  ok .  there were some really beautiful women in this film .  not just the three main female characters ,  but right across the board .  it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldn't notice how terrible everything else was .  if so ,  they failed miserably .   in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic .  it wasn't even close . 
reviewed at the sept 12 ,  2006 2nd screening at the paramount 1 theatre during the toronto international film festival .  the film had world premiered the day before at the elgin theatre visa screening room .   the basic plot involves morgan freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him ,  but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc .  the downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain dvd bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager .  he soon discovers the real-life market is run by a iron-willed  " 10 items or less "  checkout line clerk played by paz vega .  when freeman's ride never returns and vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get freeman back home and to get vega a job that'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path .   while the film was enjoyable ,  it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress .  there were two extended musical sequences  ( one with vega & freeman teaching each other children's songs in the car ,  one that literally plays like a paul simon music video )  that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long .   it's a good thing morgan freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little .  sure it was funny in parts and paz vega is a delight as well ,  but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film .   they lost me when morgan freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and paz vega said she never does that .  who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no !  ?  in the real world it's the exact opposite .   make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits .  the bit with a target store saleslady teaching morgan freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious !  an early bit where freeman's chauffeur insists it is freeman's voice on a  " books on tape "  reading was also pretty funny .   the director/writer brad silberling and actress paz vega were there for a brief q&a after the screening .  silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for morgan freeman and that once freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there .  quite a compliment for both silberling's writing and also about how freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it . 
first time of seeing buster keaton's first feature film and i have to admit i liked it a lot and only wish i'd stumbled across it years ago .  the rohauer blurb at the start warns that the three ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion ,  and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated .  so ,  it's rocky viewing in places ,  but i've seen and survived much worse .   it would have been ok as the 3 short films but as a take on intolerance it's inventive and funny from the start to the finish :  in the stone age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus ;  in the roman age buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging ,  no parking signs in latin ;  in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump .  both him and beery are after the girl through the ages ,  a never ending tussle .  favourite bit :  as the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two !   great stuff ,  reaffirming my love of silent film comedy . 
why is this film so bad ?  well ,  if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason ,  then this film is it .  the character of corky romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst .  the gags are predictable but that isn't what makes it bad .  they are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say .   corky romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy .  his quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the fbi to destroy any trace of the family's crime history .  however ,  it isn't that easy for corky because the fbi believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family .  mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesn't feel like any comic hijixn are there .  corky ends up in love with his beautiful fbi partner and has to set the record straight with both the fbi and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again .   i think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes .  chris kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film .  it is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb ,  slap stick humor .  will ferrel ,  kattan's snl partner ,  seems to have made a full career out of it .  the only difference between kattan and ferrel is that ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke .  there is absolutely no diversity in kattan's routine .  it's hard to hear the same joke twice ,  but for a whole movie that is just pure torture .   the other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and funny jokes .  the gay mafia brother ,  the awkward guy sch-tick ,  and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it .  it seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it .  even with a cast that has some comedic talent  ( chris penn ,  peter falk )  the jokes that commence are tired .  there is no chemistry too .  this film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors .  no body seemed to care about it ,  or even try .  sad thing is ,  no body told chris kattan that . 
i cringed all the way through this movie .  first of all ,  the idiotic plot has little to do with parson's own story .  hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie .  imagine  " englebert sings hendrix "  .   do not take anything about this movie to be accurate .  the name parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie ,  a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the parsons legacy and his fan base .  gram's father had long since been dead in 1973 ,  the other global characters are fictional ,  none of this has anything to do with grams life or death .   if you are a gram fan ,  i advise you to not see this movie .  i wish i hadn't .  it's saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder .  i'd swear i could hear gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing .  if you are not familiar with gram's life and legacy ,  do not take anything in this movie as being representative of gram .   i cannot say enough bad things about this movie .  if gram were alive and saw this movie ,  he would kill himself .  then again ,  maybe he'd be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result . 
while this movie won't go down in the annals of great cinema ,  it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family .  the film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place .   the film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named ,   " the hungry bachelors club "  .  jorja fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open .  bill nunn plays a cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover .  fox gives an understated and touching performance and nunn is reliably talented as always .  micheal des barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney .  the ensemble casts - made up of familiar faces - works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life .  this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family . 
many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been attempted .  that may be so ,  but the addition of the narrator and dr . suess like scenery makes this show a must watch .  with adult innuendo throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set ,  the show is both reminiscent and invigorating .  the investigative portion of the show is not what drags viewers in .  the twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what keep loyal viewers coming back for more .  this is a success that abc should never let go of .  bravo abc .  lost was getting old ,  way to revitalize prime time .  9 episodes prior to the writers strike left audiences wanting more . 
this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in 1978 .  it was a revelation to us .  we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children .  obviously we were wrong .  love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it .  but we both chose that love anyway .   and no ,  it never changed our sexual orientation .  that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos .   when we were young we both had affairs ,  but never with the opposite sex .  as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs .   this story is not far fetched .  however ,  the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me .  my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last 40 years .  we are still gay .  end of story . 
this is a pretty ok film .  .  .  yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient ,  and the movie doesn't really justify the large star cast  ( ab ,  sd ,  tanuja )  .  however ,  the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon  ( not to be confused with the singer kk )  .  in the scene where he first meets amitabh's character ,  i thought that a man who can just look at ab ,  keep staring and not say a word ,  and still look strong ,  is definitely a good actor .  in fact ,  he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar ,  alongside ab for a second time .  this guy should get more roles ,  he's brilliant .   if you've read any of the other reviews here on imdb ,  you already know the plot ,  and i do agree that akshaye khanna's entry into pakistan was a little too easy .  and the little love angle he shared with  " what's-her-face "  was completely unnecessary .  but he is a fairly good actor  ( as seen in dch )  ,  sunjay dutt is cool to watch ,  always .  and ab .  .  .  what can i say .  i don't know if i'm his biggest fan in the world ,  but i know i can definitely compete for the spot .   an interesting watch ,  considering it's bollywood ,  although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like  " the great escape "  and  " bridge on the river kwai "  . 
slow ,  slow ,  slow .  .  .  there is no mystery or excitement in this film .  if you don't figure out who the  " mole "  is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead .  the secret service must have been too ,  because it took them the whole film to put it together .  there are no compelling characters in the movie  ( not film )  .  the pace of the movie is slow there is no tension .  the hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at michael douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass .  the funniest scene in the movie is when the presidents wife says the code word at the anticlimactic ending .  it is laugh out loud ridiculous .  at least six people got up and left the movie early .  i would have joined them if i were not sitting in the middle of the row .  i would not recommend this film to anyone . 
return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie ,  it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes .  return of the boogyman is just a clip show .   mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie .  over and over again the same footage .  how boring this is .   the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie .   i have seen the first movie i don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don't know who would .  the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it . 
adolf hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u . s .  war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii .  hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived ,  starting with the conquest of eastern europe ,  expanding to the european heartland ,  then moving on to the 'world island' consisting of europe ,  asia and africa .  his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world .   in 1935 ,  hitler ordered national conscription ,  as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell .  grade school children sang his praises ,  and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps .  marching unopposed into austria in 1938 ,  hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland .  in 1939 ,  hitler took all of czechoslovakia .  later in the year ,  the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non-aggression pact with it's mortal enemy russia ,  a ploy to delay hitler's military involvement on too many fronts .  immediately after ,  germany invaded poland ,  bringing hitler's conquest right to russia's doorstep .  he would deal with her later .   it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler's thrust across europe .  prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany ,  his infamous declaration stating 'peace in our time' .  it didn't turn out that way .   the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment ,  at least to me ,  was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid '30's .  it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland .  the venue - madison square garden ! 
if you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense .  .  . then look elsewhere ,  kids ,  cause sleepwalkers really sucks .  usually i'm more eloquent than that ,  but .  .  . wow .  .  . this was bad .  i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home ,  she declines ,  and then he is seen walking home .  where's his car ?  ?  anyway ,  just don't see it ,  folks .  i really want to be more specific ,  but words escape me .  cats jumping on people .  a guy getting stabbed by corn .  cheesey lines up the proverbial  " wazoo "  .  just don't see it .  wait ,  i take that back !  see it for writer stephen king's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard .  he's actually pretty good .  even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman ,  king gives the best performance of the film .  but ,  other than that .  .  . wow .  .  . bad . 
let me start out by saying this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george :  narrator : huh ?  wait a minute !  who the heck are you ?  george :  me new george .  studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser .  narrator :  how did you get the part ?  george :  new george just lucky ,  i guess .    sadly ,  that's the only funny part in the entire movie .   it was still entertaining .  .  . but then again ,  i'm easily entertained .  .  .   i wouldn't say this is the worst movie i've ever seen  ( that title goes to the terribly un-funny disaster movie .  .  .  )  ,  this movie falls #7 on my bottom 15 list .  .  .   if your a small child who is easily entertained ,  you'll enjoy this movie .  if you're a movie-watcher who wants a good ,  funny movie ,  you'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one .  . 
what about dahmer's childhood ? - the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body ?  what about  " infinity land "  ?  - the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another ,  suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger .  what about the relationship between his parents ,  and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father ?  his feelings of neglect when his brother was born ?  what about his fascination with insects and animals ?  how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home ? what about focusing more on his cannibalism ?  and what about his parent's divorce ?  these are all things that should have been included in the film .  instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down 'snapshot' from a night or two in his life ,  and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks ,  to events that weren't even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer .   why didn't the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people ?  he could have made this point many times ,  particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them  ( which actually took place in a health club ,  not a night club )  .  instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind .   whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes  ( or however long )  ,  but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet ?   ( known as rodney in this film )  .  my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet's character ,  to try and make us fear for or empathise with him ,  but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer ,  so why couldn't he have spend those forty five minutes on something else ?  if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough ,  but it wasn't .  the scene in which he kills steven hicks ,  his first victim ,  is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing ,  and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life .  unfortunately the film doesn't explain that it was his first killing ,  or that he didn't kill again for nine years .  we assume ,  because his hair style is different ,  and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback ,  but to when ?  and why ?    what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career ? -one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations .  .   some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal ,  but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth ,  it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed .  why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued ?   finally ,  a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate ,  not a 15 .  we needed to see his perversion in more depth ,  to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us .  that doesn't mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone's head for instance ,  but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed ,  and what his modus operandi was when actually killing .  anyone watching this film who doesn't know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people .  he actually killed seventeen men .   aside from the facts and lack of depth ,  the film isn't all bad .  there is some nice cinematography ,  and good performances from the two main characters .  i'd like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge ,  more energy ,  and a better reason for making the film in the first place . 
this move was friggin hilarious !  !  !  funniest i've seen in a while ,  akshay and john kick ass as always ,  and the chicks are hot too .  the story is awesome ,  lots of great jokes ,  and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot .  to him i say that u are not of indian background so u wouldn't understand the humor u moron .  don't rate movies u don't understand .  what did u watch ,  the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation ?  thats what i thought jackass .    akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility ,  he can do not only action but comedy as well ,  and is excellent at it .  john has proved himself as well ,  this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it . 
thanks to this fungal film i do not want my maypo ,  can't stomach the thought of maltex or wheatena ,  and even that granola over there doesn't look so innocent anymore !  why wasn't the song  " slop time "  ,  by the sherrys ,  used as the theme ? 
paul verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'basic instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller .  verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films ,  both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why .  the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve  ( played by jeroen krabbé )  ;  a gay ,  alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes .  while there ,  he meets the seductive christine halsslag  ( renée soutendijk )  who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him ,  even if it kills him .   paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film ,  and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it .  many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be ,  but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration ,  and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on .  paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself ,  and that is one of things i like best about him .  this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards  ( and that doesn't happen very often !  )  .  i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work .  .  . but you'll see what i mean when you see the film  ( make sure you get the uncut version !  )  .  there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i've mentioned ,  but are lovely nonetheless ;  a man gets eaten by lions ,  another one has a pipe sent through his skull ,  a boat is smashed in half .  .  . lovely .   the acting in the fourth man isn't anything to write home about ,  but it's solid throughout .  jeroen krabbé holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer .  it is renée soutendijk that impresses the most ,  though ,  as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale .  her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct ,  but the original fatale did it best .  paul verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view ,  all of which help to create the mystery of the story .  verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish ,  but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use .  of all the verhoeven films i've seen ,  this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across ;  trust me ,  it's worth the effort . 
it is nice to see the likes of oliver stone ,  brian depalma ,  al pacino ,  and even michelle pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage .  it is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable ,  trite ,  and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time .  this movie represents the worst of hollywood .   what is this ?  is it based on a true story .  well ,  they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off usa today .  but then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the american drug subculture ;  kind of like rocky on cocaine .  is it a movie about cuba or cubans ?  for the life of me i don't believe there is a single cuban in this movie .  the accents are totally fake ,  and scene with antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest american values .  the whole scene looks like something out of the dick van dyke show .  is this movie about miami ?  it looks more like l . a .  transposed in florida .  afterall ,  a palm tree is a palm tree .  is this a romance novel .  the relationship between pacino and pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo ,  and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other .  is this a drug movie ?  well ,  no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned .  the behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water .  admittedly ,  the acting is terrible .   let's get to the rest .  the music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a lawrence welk show .  i think i heard a polka ?  the camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective .  clearly ,  the photography budget was excessive .  the sound is bleached in a number of spots ,  and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse .  the writing is appalling .  this is one of those movies were the script writes itself .  you are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next ,  each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks .   so i am going to ask ,  is this even a movie ?  it could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours .  but at least a drama series has some kind of focus .  maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together .  whatever it is ,  movie or not ,  it is a piece of crap . 
this is an interesting little flick made in 1967 ,  with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh .  .  . ok ,  it's not really stupid but it's cheesy fun .  i saw many similarities between this and 'creature with the blue hand'  ( aka the bloody dead )  and they do have the same director !  scotland yard's finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college .  seems that criminals are being let loose from a local prison to do the bidding of some evil person and then returned when their work is done .  there's a nifty device hidden inside a bible that squirts prussic acid ,  and there's another device that is neither nifty nor clandestine ,  it looks like a large squirt gun and the victim must be pretty near soaked before they expire .  joachim fuchsberger plays an inspector and he mostly chews gum and looks off into the distance .  there's a  " monk "  ,  and how anyone identifies this thing as a  " monk "  is beyond me ,  it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood ,  more of a klan member of a different color than a monk .  there's all kinds of nifty devices like a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to admit the monk ,  and it steps right over the fire without setting his robe alight ,  a nifty trick right there .  this is an odd combo of crime drama with goofy overtones ,  and while it's rather silly at times it is fun to watch .  7 out of 10 ,  not bad .  .  .  . 
enterprise ,  the latest high budget spin-off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90-minute episode called 'broken bow' .  first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban  ( who are the main enemy in the first season of the show )  .  from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is ,  with some of the best character development ,  story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time .   the opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans ,  whom some believe that the song is out of place .  what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves .  if one listens to the actual song ,  instead of the theme ,  then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together .  and eventually as the series progresses further and further ,  and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew ,  will the song actually become meaningful .  overall diane warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watson .   what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered .  enterprise is  ( in my opinion )  one of the most well cast shows since the next generation .  choosing scott bakula ,  as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jean-luc picard .  as the captain always leads the show ,  bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins .  he simply is  ( both actor wise and character wise )  a superb human being and his charm ,  wit ,  and compassion are overwhelming to watch .  as for the other cast members ,  a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr .  phlox .  it's also nice to see a non-human playing a role ,  and the decision to give the captain a dog ,  named 'porthos' was a well-received idea .  throughout the show character development was brilliant ,  it was fast ,  well timed and almost perfect .  i say almost because sadly travis mayweather's character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season .  he does have some things to say here and there ,  but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important .  jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander t'pol .  dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer .  connor trinneer plays commander charles  " trip "  tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato ,  who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting .  all of these characters make up enterprise ,  and all bring a quality that star trek hasn't seen in a long time .  each person makes this show worth watching .  smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx-01 .   the ship itself ,  the nx-01 is somewhat questionable in design .  the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk .  so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships ,  namely the akira class starship ?  continuity has been an issue in enterprise ,  but thankfully rick [berman] and brannon [braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them .  continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details .  if you see the show with and open mind ,  then you'll have no problems ,  but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time .  so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself ?  according to them the nx-01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact .  when zefram cochrane saw the enterprise-e through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker ,  it changed the ideas in his head .  that's a good enough explanation for me . lets move on .  of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer ,  some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer .  come on guys grow up . when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy ,  fans couldn't do anything ,  only watch and sap it all up anyway .  and then they learned that ,  well maybe its not that bad after all .  if you can't accept a quality show for what it is ,  not what it should be in your mind ,  then go elsewhere .  or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do .   the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine .  they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military .  perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise  ( aka flagship of the american fleet )  like it so much .  they are striking sets ,  and represent the show perfectly .   rick berman 'the overlord of the empire' as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have ,  and in all the right places .  whether that be technicalities ,  visuals ,  sound ,  editing or score .  enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be ,  when in the hands of geniuses .  the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan ,  so should you . 
think  " stage play "  .  this is worth seeing once for the performances of lionel atwill and dwight frye .  compare the melvyn douglas in  " ghost story "  with the melvyn douglas of this film .  are there vampires at loose in this 'bavarian' village ,  or is there a more natural ,  albeit equally sinister ,  explanation ?  dwight frye is herman ,  a red herring ,  who is cast as an especially moronic character .  it's fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character .  not much happens for a long time ,  but then we discover that atwill's pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer .  there is too much 'comic relief' but that is par for the course for this era .  fay wray looks really good . 
les convoyeurs attendent was the first film i saw in 2000 and i doubt i'll see a better one this year .  this beautiful tragicomedy by belgian filmmaker benoît mariage is set in the industrial wastelands of wallonia .  benoît poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car  ( a lada !  )  for him .  to do this the son has to break the record opening doors .  what the father actually wants his for his son to be someone ,  because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called l'espoir  ( hope )  .  of course nothing works out as planned .  this film can best be compared to aki kaurismäki's drifting clouds ,  although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker .  just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat ,  without being unrealistically happy .  the humour is absurd ,  without making the plot unbelievable ,  and mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial .  the best thing about les convoyeurs attendent is the acting by poelvoorde .  this actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cult-classic c'est arrivé près de chez vous in which he played the charismatic hitman ben .  since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the netherlands ,  because ,  as he said in an interview ,  he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were reprises of the ben character .  with his return to a leading role in lca there should be no doubt anymore about his acting .  he's simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery ,  but smart enough to realize what he's done and be torn by remorse about it .  a must see . 
quite typical for swedish movies of this type .  strange that the acting was soooo bad ,  these actors usually give a good show .  the casting was poorly done ,  it made you expect something  ( i won't tell you what )  .  the lead character was awful .  .  .  i don't know where they find her .  anyway ,  stay away from this and go see  " den tredje vågen "  instead ,  this is swedish action in is prime . 
i have no idea what on earth ,  or beyond ,  could have possibly made sam mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake .  ben & arthur is one of the worst movies ever made .  in fact ,  i see no reason why it should not be at #1 on the bottom 100 .  for although i have not seen ,  for example ,  superbabies :  baby geniuses 2  ( #5 at the time of this publication )  ,  i would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound ,  because even in its vapid dismalness at least baby geniuses 2 was professionally made .  by contrast ,  everything ,  and i do mean everything ,  in this film is completely unprofessional .   the movie is intended to be an attack on the christian right's supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays .  and i do emphasize  " intended .  "  not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose ,  it also leaves an ugly scar .  instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple's struggle against a society that largely opposes them ,  it creates tired ,  crass stereotypes of each party involved .  ben and arthur ,  the namesake couple ,  are portrayed as two crude ,  sex-starved ,  and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so .  this meets with the opposition of ben's brother victor ,  a christian minister who ,  like all christians  ( as this movie would have us believe )  ,  is loud ,  prying ,  stupid ,  and violent .  he tries to kill ben and arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry .  just like in real life .  and if you think that's dreadful  ( it is )  ,  you haven't seen it all .   the actors  (  ?  )  here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a youtube home comedy video .  but not even daniel day-lewis and marlon brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker ,  for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh-inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie .  every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote .  for example ,  in one scene ,  victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother's homosexuality .  but instead of portraying this idea clearly ,  he spits out the stupid ,  utterly confusing ,  whiny-sounding line ,   " you know what ,  i'm never going to have any nieces or nephews ,  okay ,  because you're so f***ed up !  "   even more glaring is the complete lack of production values .  yes ,  i know this ain't the dark knight ,  but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing .  for example ,  six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds .  people do not teleport across a room between takes .  and objects do not fall forward when shot !    do not waste your money on ben & arthur .  i don't care if you're 7 ,  17 ,  or 107 .  i don't care if you're gay ,  straight ,  bi ,  or undecided .  i don't care if you're  " just curious .  "  i don't care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung-heap .  stay away ,  far away .  this movie's only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a frisbee . 
overshadowed by  " braveheart "  released the same year ,  the two costume dramas beg comparison .  i admit my bias against mel gibson ,  yet i maintain a rational preference for  " rob roy .  "  both  " braveheart "  and  " rob roy "  compellingly depict scots history in bloody ,  romantic fashion .   " braveheart "  is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy .  it's also melodramatic ,  anachronistic and maudlin .  note its cornball usage of slow motion filming .  its violence is both ugly and glorious .  it is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset .  while  " braveheart "  surpasses  " rob roy "  in sheer levels of carnage  ( not to mention its indulgent running time )  ,  the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying .  its action is more understated ,  yet more surprising and clever .  its sex is less showy ,  yet more erotic .   " rob roy "  also has a better realized romantic interest .  its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period .  its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era .  and tim roth is a superlative villain .  also recommended :   " the last of the mohicans "  and  " the patriot .  "  you may find the latter more akin to  " braveheart "  with its emphasis on blood lust ,  with the former more similar to  " rob roy "  in tone .  all the of the aforementioned movies merit their r ratings for violence . 
too many sources routinely lump this thought-provoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar  " nunsploitation "  which was a mainstay in '70s euro trash cinema ,  overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor .  perhaps coincidentally it was also director gianfranco mingozzi's singular attempt at narrative film-making outside of many well-received documentaries .   safely set within a historical context ,  flavia charts the growing rebellion of an early 15th century italian nun  ( florinda bolkan's career performance ,  even surpassing her sterling work in lucio fulci's devastating don't torture a duckling )  ,  locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl's budding sensuous nature .  wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture ,  she is confronted by ways in which male domination can rupture female lives ,  inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semi-crazed older sister agatha  ( indelibly portrayed by veteran actress maria casarès from marcel carné's les enfants du paradis )  and - more constructively - by a muslim invasion .  joining the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding ,  flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be ,  with expected tragic results .   with its breathtaking widescreen compositions by alfio contini ,  who shot michelangelo antonioni's zabriskie point ,  this is an uncompromising and austere account of one woman's fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which allotted her no rights beyond childbearing or whoring as sister agatha wryly remarks .  a lengthy drug-induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on ken russell's otherwise far more flamboyant devils notwithstanding ,  the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department ,  making something of a mockery out of its semi-porn reputation .  this is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation . 
this movie was poorly written ,  poorly acted and very predictable .  it was very low-budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video .  it wasn't even campy fun ,  it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the 1-1/2 hours back !  the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them .    the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch !  skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre .  just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this .   ejames6342
two things haunt you throughout l'intrus  ( the intruder )  :  who's the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you're watching ?  the ending is so shocking that for a while you're at a loss for an answer to either of those questions .  the intruder pops up as different characters ,  different men in different circumstances who don't belong in the scene ,  so they're expelled from it ,  kindly or brutally ,  but often without emotional involvement .  the main character ,  louis ,  is a contemptible man .  he's got rough ways ,  some mean job and no heart .  he needs one and goes after it .  he has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life .  can this man succeed in his quest for redemption ?  a guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat .  you know it but claire denis doesn't encourage you to judge him .  occasionally ,  there's a young russian woman -a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth - who does judge him .  she may even punish him .  but not denis .  there's the character played by beatrice dalle who wants no business with him :  don't touch me ,  she says .  but denis lets this man be himself ,  films him in his self-absorbed quest .  i don't know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isn't the traditional plot basics .  whatever she films ,  you get it in the end .  you know who's  " the "  intruder ,  you know why ,  more or less ,  and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning .  but was it a movie or a dream ? 
de grot is a very good film .  the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbé ,  who also adapted this story for the screen .  some really top-class acting ,  not only by van huêt ,  but especially by marcel hensema ,  who mostly did tv-work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf .  the film seems to kick of as a thriller ,  and sets an excellent mood .  then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf ,  and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure ,  which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie .  in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending ,  that will grab audiences by their throats .  make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie .  a must-see ,  especially if you liked 'spoorloos'  ( the vanishing's original screen adaptation )  . 
i know i should like this film ,  and i do for the most part ,  but as other's have mentioned ,  it is a bit long in the tooth .  i to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying .  it's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well .  i also have to say that overall ,  the movie leaves me cold .  it's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film .  on the plus side the effects are great  ( besides the cartoon monster )  ,  as are the effects ,  props ,  costumes and of course robbie .  if the robot was not in this film ,  i don't think it would have been as popular as it was/is .  the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the  " krell .  "  as many times as i've seen this movie ,  the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were .  based on what was being produced at that time ,  besides  " this island earth ,  "  forbidden planet is miles above the average sci-fi movies of the time .  being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment .  certainly a classic in its own right ,  flaws and all ,  and deservedly so . 
thank god this wasn't based on a true story ,  because what a story it is .  populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds ,  before the devil is a mesmerizing ,  jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable  ( and sometimes is ,  even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout )  if it weren't carried out with such magnificent ,  overwhelming conviction by its stars .  the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn't hurt either .   the main dysfunction here is of a family nature ,  with the two majorly screwed up brothers  ( brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke )  deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store ,  an attempt that goes pathetically awry .   the story is told with time-shifts  ( which are noted on screen ,  such as :   " charlie :  two days before the robbery "  ,  so no one should be confused )  ;  some people have said they didn't like this device but i thought it worked perfectly ,  adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair ,  considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life .  throw in these cheesy extra tidbits :  one of the brothers is a drug addict ,  married to gina  ( marisa tomei ,  also excellent )  ,  who is having an affair with the other brother ,  toss in some monumental sibling rivalry ,  along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father  ( a wrenching performance from albert finney )  ,  who has apparently caused him serious past pain ,  and you've got a shakespearean/greek tragedy on your hands .  proceed with caution . 
anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie .  the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath yuen woo ping ,  who also did the fights in the matrix .  and the fight scenes are somethin .   li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain ,  who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian  ( ya got me )  .  when other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade ,  li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them .   there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie  ( one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices )  .  the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches ;  the body count is way up there .  li has seldom been better ,  and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars  ( yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier )  .  anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord  ( no suprises there ;  he makes a cameo in every hk movie )  .  it's unfortunate they don't make action movies like this in the us ;  i wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i crave so much .  recommended . 
i was just a bit young for this one ,  but i had to see it .  there's some excellent music ,  which many folks have mentioned ,  but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by  " angel "  ,  a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit .  wearing their trademark white outfits ,  they grind through  " 20th century foxes "  ,  and apparently all try to cram into the camera's field of vision .  keyboardist gregg giuffria remains the bands highlight ,  and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut ,  ever !  cherie currie  ( ex-runaways singer )  begins a brief ,  but notable ,  acting career here ,  and is quite memorable alongside jodie foster ,  and the rest .   ( her topless 3-d scenes in  " parasite "  ,  and her ufo sighting ,  in  " wavelength "  kept us all watching her for a time )  .    it's not a masterpiece ,  but it preserves a chunk of its period ,  for all to gaze upon ,  and wonder . 
if you like gangster type of movies ,  then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent ,  al pacino his performance is top notch .  and the story is classic !  !  10 / 10  !  !  !  !  why isn't this movie in the top 250 list ?  ? 
robert culp  ( they call his character  " doctor "  .  .  . i think he's a vet or something )  and family move to an affluent ,  low-tax ,  zero-law-enforcement suburb .  lantern-jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and  " go cruising "  through his front yard at 60mph .  he presses charges ,  which arouses the kids' ire ,  and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign .   marilyn manson ,  er ,  marlyn mason rather ,  plays his fretful ,  boiled-celery wife ,  who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses ,  and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services .  but the system is getting culp nowhere ,  and he's not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music .  and we all know what movie people do when the system fails .  .  .  ( but this is based on a true story ,  which makes it even better )  .   it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient '70s funk-o-matic  " teenage "  theme music that warns us when they're up to no good ,  this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even-handedly  ( really !  )  .  it doesn't make a big generational thing out of it .  kudos for that .   anyway ,  if you like dogs  ( or at least believe in protecting their civil rights ,  like me )  ,  and you like justice ,  and you like fire ,  and you like justice for dogs by way of fire ,  and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are  " too damn soft ,  "  then this flick's ethos is up your alley .  no ,  it's not really  " good ,  "  at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word .  there's nothing subtle or understated or clever about it ,  it's just sort of a feature-length psa for vigilantism .  it does ,  however ,  capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other ,  beloved works .  remember in frank miller's the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city ?  remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully's face in ?  remember how cool that was ?  or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors ?  yeah ,  mon .   unfortunately ,  this was a 1973 made-for-tv movie that i just happened to catch at 4am on my local wb affiliate ,  and it's probably not destined for dvd release .  but after being inspired by this film ,  do you think i'm gonna just sit here and take it !  ?  ! 
people love the original story for its ending .  the hollywood style ending made this 99 version of 'a dog of flanders' just for kids movie .  i didn't cry this time because the story was too hollywood .  japanese tv series are much better . 
the complaints are valid ,  to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women .  i am okay with these night time soaps ,  like grey's anatomy ,  or ugly betty ,  or west wing ,  because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end .  however ,  when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men  ( taye diggs ,  tim daly ,  and chris lowell )  into sexual tension and romps ,  and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital ,  it seems like general hospital .  .  . or a female counterpart to baywatch .  that was what men wanted and they had it ,  so if this is what women want so be it ,  but the idea that this is a high brow show  ( or something men will watch )  is unrealistic . 
this may not be the worst comedy of all time ,  but it's close .  the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life ,  and i want it back !   chris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes .  his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old ,  and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse .  he falls into a long line of former snl-ers that have attempted movies .  some have been brilliant ,  some have failed miserably .  there's not much middle ground in this category .  although chris farley was brilliant ,  and then okay ,  and then not so funny ,  and then dead .  .  . so i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career .   avoid this movie like the plague .   c
after seeing the  " batman dead end "  short ,  i didn't know what to really expect from world's finest .  of course ,  superman and batman .  all my world's finest comic books have them as the team-up .   after seeing this 3-and-a-half minute trailer ,  it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for world's finest ,  if not an actual full-length film .   sure ,  some of the superman stuff was cheesy ,  but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers ,  giving you only certain aspects of the entire product .  this looks like it needs a complete product .   other than director sandy collera's relative playing an achingly poor perry white ,  most of the actors were unknown .  if an actual movie was made ,  actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film ,  though i believe nina kaczorowski would make a good lois lane ,  especially if given closer-to-the-character dialogue .   good to see clark bartram wearing the batman costume from dead end ,  but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s batman with the 80s-90s leather cape and cowl .  his demeanor is batman-like ,  but i still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask .  i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona .   michael o'hearn cannot play superman ,  period .  he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says ,   " slap me .  "  and line delivery seems to be a problem with him .   overall ,  though ,  i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work .  there was a rumor about a world's finest movie being made ,  and with the correct additions to the script ,  this could be it .  hope more like this are made . 
the impossible planet and the satan pit together comprise the two best episodes of the 'new' doctor who's second season .  having said that ,  it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of quatermass and the pit  ( 1967 )  to an outer space setting ,  with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the beast 666 .  these episodes cement the emotional ties between rose and the doctor ,  whilst also highlighting rose's increasing self-confidence ,  establishing her as a not-quite-equal-yet-but-getting-there partner with our beloved time lord .  also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay ,  which decreases the occasional over-reliance on one-liners for the doctor ,  and the performances of the entire cast ,  most notably the excellent shaun parkes as acting captain zachary cross flane . 
never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent .  let's see :  first ,  they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread .  next ,  they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget .  and finally ,  when the film hits the theaters ,  get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again ,  bus them into the multiplexes if necessary ,  not on the merits of the film itself ,  but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory .   but that ,  of course ,  won't be enough .  i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give  " left behind "  anything short of a glowing review will be deemed  " anti-christian .  "   of course ,  this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn't surprise anyone .  it is ,  after all ,  good old fashioned capitalism at work .  what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole  " left behind "  mindset .  as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality ,  it leaves me scratching my head .  it would appear that there are many ,  many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a  " rapture "  is going to occur ,  and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air .  what kind of reality ,  i wonder ,  are these people living in ?  is this  " rapture "  something they actually believe in ,  or is it something they fervently want to believe in ?  and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this  " rapture "  has not occurred ,  will they be disappointed and disillusioned ?  will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the  " rapture "  is imminent ?   in a way ,  i almost wish that such an event would occur !  what an interesting day that would be !  what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion ,  not in the anthropological sense the authors of the  " left behind "  series have portrayed ,  but as more of a stephen spielberg production ,  with boiling clouds ,  trumpets ,  angels descending out of the sky ,  moon turned to blood ,  the whole nine yards .  imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true ,  just as the evangelists had been warning for years ,  and that there was something more awesome than just the cold ,  hard ,  physical reality we inhabit .  wouldn't that be something ?  ?  ?   yet in the final analysis ,  it's that cold ,  hard ,  physical reality that i will content myself with .  my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a  " rapture "  and the  " end times "  to make sense of it all  .  .  .  nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently ,  thank you very much . 
this movie can be labeled as a study case .  it's not just the fact that it denotes an unhealthy and non-artistic lust for anything that might be termed as caco-imagery .  the author lives with the impression that his sanctimonious revolt against some generic and childishly termed social ills  (  " moldavia is the most pauper region of europe "  ,   " i don't believe one iota in the birds flu "  ,   " romanian people steal because they are poor ;  europeans steal because they are thieves "  )  are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude - but he is sorely off-target !    what daneliuc doesn't know ,  is that it's not enough to pose as a righteous person - you also need a modicum of professionalism ,  talent and intelligence to transpose this stance into an artistic product .  fatefully ,   " the foreign legion "  shows as much acumen as a family video with uncle gogu drunkenly wetting himself in front of the guests .  the script is chaotic and incoherent ,  randomly bustling together sundry half-subjects ,  in an illiterate attempt to suggest some kind of a story .  the direction is pathetically dilettante - the so-called  " director "  is unable to build up at least a mediocre mise-en-scene ,  his shots are annoyingly awkward ,  and any sense of storytelling shines by total absence .   ( of course ,  any comment is forced to stop at this level ;  it would be ridiculous to mention concepts as  " cinematographic language "  ,   " means of expression "  or  " style "  )  .  the acting is positively  " cântarea româniei "   (  " romania's chant "  )  level ,  with the exception of .  .  .  paradoxically ,  the soccer goal-keeper necula raducanu ,  who is very natural ,  and nicodim ungureanu .  oana piecnita seems to have a genuine freshness ,  but she is compromised by the amateurish directions given by daneliuc .   the most serious side of this offense to decent cinema is the fact that the production received a hefty financing from the national budget ,  via c . n . c .   ( the national cinematography council )  .  the fact that long-time-dead old dinosaurs like daneliuc are still thirsty for the government udder is understandable  ( in a market-driven economy ,  they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection )  .  but the corruption of the so-called  " jury "  that squanders the country's money on such ridiculously scabrous non-art ,  non-cinema and non-culture belongs to the criminal field . 
the secret of kells is an independent ,  animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the book of kells ,  an illuminated manuscript from the middle ages featuring the four gospels of the new testament .  i didn't know that this book actually exists ,  but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier .  there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be ,  who wrote it ,  and how it has survived over 1 , 000 years .  this is one of them .   we are introduced to brendan ,  an orphan who lives at the abbey of kells in ireland with his uncle ,  abbot cellach  ( voiced by brendan gleeson )  .  abbot cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks .  brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks .  they are more focused on reading and writing ,  something abbot cellach does not have time for anymore .  he fears the  " northmen ,  "  those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground .   one day a traveler comes from the island of iona near scotland .  it is brother aidan ,  a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished .  abbot cellach grants him permission to stay and brendan buddies up with him .  aidan has special plans for brendan .  first he needs ink for the book ,  but he requires specific berries .  the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest ,  an area off limits to brendan .  seeing that he is the only chance for aidan to continue his work ,  he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence .   in the forest brendan meets ashley ,  the protector of the forest .  she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company .  she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it .  there are things worse than vikings out there .  from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion .   i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about .  knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains ,  the animation makes perfect sense .  i'm sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago ,  with frilly borders ,  colorful pictures ,  and extravagant patterns ,  creatures ,  and writings adorning the pages .  much like the opening frames of disney's the sword in the stone .  the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns .  it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other .   i couldn't take my eyes off of the incredible detail .  this is some of the finest 2d animation i have seen in years .  it's vibrant ,  stimulating ,  and full of life .  the characters are constantly surrounded by designs ,  doodles ,  and patterns in trees ,  on the walls ,  and in the air just floating around .  it enhances the film .   the story is satisfactory ,  although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more .  with a runtime of only 75 minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act .  it doesn't give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book .  we are reminded of it's importance but never fully understand .  we are told that it gives hope ,  but never why or how .  that was really the only lacking portion of the film .  otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation .   i guess that's okay to a certain degree .  the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short .  the story lacks a few parts ,  but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history .  i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about .  i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more .  this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed . 
this is a wonderful film .  the non-stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate .  the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated .  i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts .  joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together .  some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's movies .  put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is . 
the film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named 'gabe' ,  who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole .  gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon gabe meets up with the dead end kids .  the kids in this film are little punks ,  but they are much less antisocial than they'd been in other previous films and down deep ,  they are well-meaning punks .  however ,  in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see gabe as a convenient scapegoat--after all ,  he'd been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed .  so ,  when gabe is about ready to be sent back to  " the big house "  ,  it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks .   the  " dead end kids "  appeared in several warner brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good  ( particularly angels with dirty faces )  .  however ,  after the boys' contracts expired ,  they went on to monogram studios and the films ,  to put it charitably ,  were very weak and formulaic--with huntz hall and leo gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed  " the bowery boys "  .  because angels wash their faces had the excellent writing and production values and hall and gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera ,  it's a pretty good film--and almost earns a score of 7  ( it's real close )  .  in fact ,  while this isn't a great film aesthetically ,  it's sure a lot of fun to watch ,  so i will give it a 7 !  sure ,  it was a tad hokey-particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and reagan ignores the bill of rights--but it was also quite entertaining .  the dead end kids are doing their best performances and ronald reagan and ann sheridan provided excellent support .  sure ,  this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming--so if you can suspend disbelief ,  it works well . 
i never bothered to see this movie in theaters although i remember hearing the name over and over .  i finally watched it this week and what a delight .  for some reason ,  i was expecting it to not be very good so i was completely surprised when i sat down and stuck with it and then found myself completely pulled in .  i read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring ,  but what was wonderful about diana is that she's a true fighter in life .  all she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the ring helps her to get there .  a very intelligent story and i'm amazed that this is the first time up for michelle rodriguez - what an excellent job she did .  adrian and her coach were also quite good .   this film is a little rough around the edges ,  but it doesn't matter in the slightest .  the story ,  the will ,  and the performances completely outweigh any flaws  ( that usually come with indie filmmaking anyway )  .  a compelling portrayal of a girl finding herself and triumphing over her circumstances and a k . o .  for michelle rodriguez ! 
i watched this movie and the original carlitos way back to back .  the difference between the two is disgusting .  now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script .  now maybe it's just me ,  but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie ,  starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didn't know .  rise to power is just a movie that has carlito's name .  there should have been at least a few characters from the original movie ,  the ending makes no sense in relation to the original .  in the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie ?  and his woman isn't even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original .  i would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self ,  with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to it's big brother .  don't lay awake at night waiting to see this ,  watch the original one more time if you really need a hit . 
this documentary has been aired on both rte and bbc in the last number of months .  having seen it twice now i would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary film making .   initially this documentary was meant to detail the political life of venezuelan president hugo chavez .  the irish crew set off with those intentions .  what happens when they get to venezuela is startling as they witness first hand the attempted overthrow by rebel factions  ( particularly the oil concerns in venezuela )  of chavez and his government .  what we the audience witness is just how the media manipulates the situation and in effect backs the overthrow of chavez by distorting events that transpire as the coup heightens .   it really is an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers .   
when i ordered this from blockbuster's website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was .  who knows ?  maybe i'd forgotten to take my add meds that day .  i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon ,  donned in their late 70's-style wide collars ,  bell-bottoms and feathered hair ,  i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster .   the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning ,  trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe ,  forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer .  from the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the  " monsters "  from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of 'the vagina monologues' .   throughout the film ,  the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear .  the  " ship "  was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path .  of course if moved slower than bob barker's impacted bowels ,  but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two  ( with some assistance )  .   moving on .  .  .  as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue .  .  .  we found out that they're caught in a  " space time warp "  .  how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information ?  because the oldest male lead tells his son that ,  in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion ,  like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing coca-cola .  was pops a scientist ?  nope ,  but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einstein's theories .   the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality .  the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone ,  other than that ,  it was really ,  really ,  really bad .   ( there's not enough 'really's' to describe it ,  really )  .   i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics .  i never saw this film on its original release ,  but even back then i think i would've come to the same conclusion :  bury this one quick . 
how this movie escaped the wrath of mst3k i'll never know .   " gymkata "  is a ridiculous action movie ,  filled  ( or is that empty ?  )  with paper-thin plots ,  dumb characters ,  and preposterous situations .  but take it from me ,  if you enjoy watching poor ,  yet goofy ,  movies ,  you will enjoy  " gymkata "  a great deal .   the action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents  ( at least i think they were government agents )  to become a spy .  you see his dad was another quasi-government agent ,  who has gone missing competing in this game ,  called ,  eloquently ,   " the game .  "  so the gymnast  ( played blandly by kurt thomas )  trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad .   sounds promising doesn't it ?  okay ,  so it doesn't but still ,  that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie .  they can be found in the movie's strange details .  like the gymnast's mysterious asian girlfriend ,  who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie ,  then all of a sudden begins to talk ,  and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time !  or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break  " the game " 's non-existent rules whenever he so pleases .  and of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the  " village of the crazies "   ( evidently that's the place's real name !  )  .  nice place to visit ,  but i wouldn't want to live there .   but where this movie really shines is the action scenes .  since our protagonist is a gymnast ,  the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of middle eastern cities ,  so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses .  it has to be seen to be believed .   one interesting thing of note .  a lot ,  i'd say about half the cast ,  dies from being shot with an arrow .  interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie .  if these were indeed effects ,  my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds .  more likely ,  this was the film's way of not paying extras .  nevertheless ,   " gymkata "  deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing .   
after i got done watching this movie i was so upset that i had wasted 2 hours of my life .  that's 2 hours i'll never get back .  ugh .  when you start this you might think  " wow this is really good !  "  but rest assured that first impressions mean nothing .  i was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending i have ever seen .  this movie is simply pathetic .  the acting is bland ,  the story line is anything but original and there's nothing especially unique about this except that it's the worst movie ever !  !  !  do not watch this movie !  !  !  warning !  !  dumbest movie ever you will be sorry if you waste 2 hours of your life on this !  !  !  1/10
there is nothing cool ,  hip ,  or clever about this film-- liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema .  how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean & ugly people are  .   .   .  serial killers !  if they have to dismember total strangers in order to  " be a family again ,  "  then we don't want them to  " be a family .  "  what part of that did you have trouble grasping ?  why applaud this filth ?   this silly filth is what you do if you can't do art !  one's head & life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as  " interesting .  "  this is a camera without a brain .  what really makes an artwork cool is profundity ,  questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history  ( or ,  in this case ,  a knowledge of anything would be preferable !  )  .  instead ,  this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown ,  thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as  " cool cause it's so far out ,  man !  "  )  .  these same violent events actually happen ,  every day .  they are not  " just in the film .  "  they refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to you .  do you want those things done to you ?  a child could have thought this up ,  it required zero imagination ,  it is not surrealism .  this lazy crap has no content ,  is saying nothing--it's just the worst of the evening news ,  & it is saying nothing new ,  nothing we don't already know .  it's  " the emperor's new clothes ,  "  the director hoping there are enough uneducated children ,  proud of their streak of inhumanity ,  for this sloppy filth to fly .  i can see director miike's demented fans now :  chain-smoking teens-and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos ,  with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces ,  their knowledge-base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves  .   there is no plot to this--it is just sheer exploitation of shock-value violence .  there is no  " hidden meaning "  anywhere in this poorly made film .  it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic ,  but you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not there !  to do that you need to view & review a real piece of cinema .  there are plenty out there ,  directed by fellini ,  bergman ,  fassbinder ,  herzog ,  altman ,  bunuel ,  kurosawa ,  lynch ,  tarkovsky ,  peter greenaway ,  tarantino ,  guillermo del toro ,  richard linklater ,  eisenstein ,  aronofsky ,  gus van sant ,  soderbergh ,  shyamalan ,  ordet .  why don't you view a real art film by the likes of these giants ?  this wannabe director ,  miike ,  will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesn't have the talent !  anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like  " visitor q .  "  teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon !  there's no message ,  no meaning ,  no plot ,  nothing to it at all .  there are long lists of art films to learn from--but this  " visitor q "  is not an art film in any respect .  it has no content to it .  it's just one banal horror piled onto another ,  and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen ,  every single day ,  somewhere in the world .  they are not okay because they are  " just in the film .  "  they refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to you .  do you want those things done to you ?  to others ?  why ?  because this world is already ugly enough ,  thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this .    there are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct ,  but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap .  there is no deeper meaning .  there is nothing to analyze ;  why keep trying ?  i've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made ,  and keeping up with all the new ones ,  but i've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this .  it's not imaginative or even shocking ,  because these types of events happen daily all over the world .  to make this film ,  or even to favorably review it ,  has caused over 50 young airheads who don't know any better to think it's  " cool .  "  they may grow up thinking that ,  convincing others ,  some of whom may end up doing these things--convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way ,  by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity .  trust me on this , --i know cool ,  and cool this piece of crap ain't .  visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film ,  and i'm still not sure it isn't ,  actually .    your actions have consequences ,  son .  the world is awful enough already .  some violence like this could happen to you ,  or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film .  believe me ,  you won't be thinking it's  " cool "  when someone is sawing your skull in half ! 
how amazing this film is !  i've seen it over and over throughout the years and i'm always spellbound by it .  the reason why the film is so easy to re-watch is ,  of course ,  the arresting performance given by the young bette davis .  she not only steals every scene that she's in ,  but is actually much prettier and better photographed here  ( not to mention sexier )  than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio ,  warner brothers  ( this film was made by r . k . o .  radio pictures )  .  she wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh ,  those lovely big eyes  ( especially ,  in the restaurant scenes that take place in london's soho )  .  her body was so curvy when she was young .  get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with leslie howard .  and oh boy ,  she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene .  howard is a little too nervous throughout ,  but he does captures the hero's sensitivity .  frances dee scores as the sweet ,  pretty young sally who truly loves him .  max steiner's score is both charming and poignant .  splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel . 
christopher lee is one of my favorite actors !  i'm trying to view all of his work .  he has been known to single-handedly save movies with his presence .  unfortunately ,  this is not one of them .  this movie suffers from a low budget and it's production values are disturbing .  please .  .  . for the love of christopher .  .  .  . avoid this film ! 
this comment does contain spoilers !  !   there are few actors that have an intangible to them .  that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma ,  panache and swagger .  it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great .  i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson .  you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good-bye to andy garcia in ocean's 11 when they just utter each other's name disdainfully .   " terry .  "   " danny .  "  you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene .  these guys just have it .  you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does .  if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name ,  you can see that there is no finer an actor working today .  i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work ,  but he is definitely the cog of the production .  i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw ,  emotional and incendiary all at the same time .   washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives .  he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led .  he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man .  his friend and perhaps mentor ,  played very reservedly by christopher walken ,  is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich .  apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s . e . a . l . s and such can do very well while providing a needed service .  creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty .  marc anthony is fine as samuel ,  radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita .  i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy .  the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role ,  perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly .  but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role .   it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema .  together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them .  tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better .  i am interested to see how his next film ,  domino ,  turns out .  i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one ,  his name will surely be elevated to icon status .   the story has creasy really taking to pita ,  and vis-ca versa .  there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad ,  he is not around much .  he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family .  soon ,  creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition .  he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear  " creasy "  .  it's not just a friendship between them ,  it is more of a kinship ,  and a deep parental love seems to be present .    the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her .  this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion .  and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force .  like i said earlier ,  i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day ,  but never have i seen him like this .  he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead ,  he becomes a literal man on fire .  it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance .  denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation .  this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind .    also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance .  i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily .  they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die .  but not in this film .  writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful .  the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes .  there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice .  he needs information and someone loses a finger .  he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things .  there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film .   man on fire is one the five best films of 2004 .  now that it is out on dvd ,  my recommendation is to get the se .  it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks .  10/10
there is so much that can be said about this film .  it is not your typical nunsploitation .  of course ,  there is nudity and sex with nuns ,  but that is almost incidental to the story .   it is set in 15th century italy ,  at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christians at otranto .  the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film .  it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim hoards ,  that the mother superior would ask ,   " why do you fear the muslims ,  ;  they will not do anything that the christians have done to you ?  "  certainly ,  there was enough torture on both sides .   sister flavia  ( florinda bolkan )  is sent to a convent for defying her father .  in the process ,  she witnesses and endures many things :  the gelding of a stallion ,  the rape of a local woman by a new duke ,  the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect ,  and a whipping herself when she ran off with a jew .  the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun ,  and her nipples cut off .   sister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives .  she even asks jesus ,  why the father ,  son and holy ghost are all men .   eventually ,  she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent .  here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time .  but ,  tragedy is to come .  she manages to exact sweet revenge on all ,  including the duke and her father ,  but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same .  she is a woman and that is all there is to it .   i won't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end ,  but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decades .   nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats ,  but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest . 
just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the  " thing "  in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street .  of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling .   for me this just didn't come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film .  the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking ,  something it never really is .  it doesn't help that the final revelation is less a scare then an  " oh "  ,  as on  " oh thats it ?  "  .  maybe if i hadn't been watching so many horror films recently this might have been better or it may have just seemed it since i wouldn't have compared it to so much .   i'd take a pass
christ .  a sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time ,  this at least has the decency to leave out the songs  ( bar a reprise of the unbearable  " tomorrow "  )  but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny .  this time ,  annie and her friends head off to london and get caught up in joan collins's plot to blow up buckingham palace or some such shite .  the movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is :  every time the little bugger squeals  " leapin' lizards !  "  i could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder .  drearily photographed ,  slushy and plodding ,  the movie has only one memorable line  (  " unhand me ,  you stupid genius !  "  )  and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it . 
this should be a great film .  .  .  meryl streep and jack nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers .  mike nichols directing .  uh uh .  it's dull dull dull !  pointless and predictable !  slow and unfocused !   it's a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl ,  boy marries girl ,  boy has affair ,  girl leaves boy' story .  now theres an original concept !  after squirming through two hours  ( was it only two ?  it felt like six .  ) i wasn't sure whether it was a comedy ,  a romance ,  a tragedy or a soap opera .  it was done in 1986 .  i'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget .  i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade .  it's not that it's such a bad picture .  it's just that it's such an un-good one . 
stewart moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife ,  and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his head .  .  . imagine the auditions for this .  .  " can you .  .  . no ,  that's not quite it ,  thank you ,  next !  "  .  anyway ,  he's bitten by a bat ,  and then ,  he's either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing people or .  .  .  . he's not .  for no one else sees his strange transformations ,  but he himself seems to think that he's changing because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turn into claws ,  etc .  to its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether he's just nuts or whether he's actually transforming into something until almost the very end .  this has some good locations & sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting .  kind of fun in a  " so bad it's good "  way ,  but leans more towards just plain bad .  4 out of 10 . 
i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk .  well actually ,  it doesn't ,  because this film is everything a hollywood film isn't - original ,  creative ,  quirky and humorous .  it seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as ,  in the simplest terms ,  it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film .   i haven't written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention ,  even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes !  essentially ,  it is about nothing ,  as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world .  the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white ,  empty space .  this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors ,  both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles .   i'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit .  however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try .  a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion ,  with the combination of good performances ,  a strong script ,  nice sound design and  ( fairly )  impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie .   it's just a shame so few people know about nothing .  .  .  . 
saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon , when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun .  i mean , the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness !  it was the first movie i watched with this theme ( drugs/marijuana )  that is not really criticizing it , only making jokes about it .  grace trevethyn is a widow , who lives in a small town in u . k .  and has many financial problems because of her dead husband ,  who committed suicide since he was full of debts .  the problem is that grace ,  who imagined to have some money saved for her ,  discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things ,  specially her house that she loves so much .  she never worked before ,  and is in a tragic situation until matthew , her gardener who is very found of smoking pot ,  decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale .

yesterday ,  i went to the monthly antique flea market that comes to town .  i really have no interest in such things ,  but i went for the fellowship of friends who do have such an interest .  looking over the hundreds of vendor ,  passing many of them quickly ,  i spotted someone selling vhs tapes and dvds .  most of the films he had on dvd were rather recent ;  the oldest one i noticed was the 1940 cary grant-irene dunne co-starrer my favorite wife .  but the vhs tapes ,  by their nature ,  were mostly older films .  i couldn't resist buying something since they were being sold at 3 tapes for $10 . 00 .  what a bargain ,  as eddie murphy used to say .  i came across one film that i had heard about for years but had never seen :  john cassavettes's opening night  ( 1977 )  .  well ,  i certainly wanted that being a fan of gena rowlands ,  and i had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances .  he also had faces  ( 1968 )  .  i had seen this about 20 years ago ,  a time when i probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly .  and i wanted to take advantage of the bargain ,  so i grabbed that one too .  my other choice was claire's knee  ( 1970 )  .    when i got home ,  i decided to put aside the work i had planned to do so that i could watch opening night .  i was totally enthralled by this film .  it focuses on myrtle gordon  ( gena rowlands )  ,  a famous actress of stage and screen ,  who ,  during out-of-town previews ,  is having personal and professional problems coming to terms with both her character and the play's theme of facing aging .  after one rehearsal ,  an avid fan and autograph hound accosts her with cries  ( and tears )  of  " i love you !  i love you !  "  a few minutes later ,  this fan is hit by a car and killed .  this begins myrtle's descent into herself where she must face her own fears of aging ,  the future of her career as a mature actress ,  and the inadequacies she finds in the play itself  ( written by a much older female dramatist ,  played by joan blondell )  .  throughout the film ,  she sees the dead girl ,  an obvious symbol of her past ;  drinks almost constantly ;  and receives insincere support from her director  ( ben gazzara )  ,  the producer  ( paul stewart )  ,  her costar  ( john cassavettes himself )  ,  and the dramatist .  actually ,  they're more concerned about how her behavior will affect them and their careers :  flubbing lines on stage ,  improvising new lines ,  generally cracking up on stage ,  and arriving for the broadway opening totally drunk .    this story functions not only to address the issues of aging but also to promote cassavettes's displeasure with mainstream movie-making .  as i watched the film ,  i was at times surprised ,  confused ,  amused ,  disparaging ,  but ultimately involved ,  entertained ,  and satisfied .  cassavettes really had a great sense of humor ,  cared very much that his audience understood what he was implying ,  and wanted them to be emotionally involved in the story .  he makes allusions to all about eve with the use of the avid theater fan ,  even dressing the young girl in a slicker and hat similar to the one worn by anne baxter at the beginning of that film .  this allusion functions most obviously to support his aging theme ,  the contrast of the older and younger woman .  he also obviously uses the contrast as a symbol for myrtle's confronting her own lost youth .  at first ,  i felt the symbolism was too obvious ,  but then i realized that that was cassavettes's intention .  he doesn't want his audience misunderstanding what he's getting at ;  if they did ,  it would interfere with their emotional involvement .  this spectre of youth haunts myrtle ,  attacks her ,  and wants to destroy her .  myrtle eventually  " kills "  her ,  but before she can really come to terms with herself and the play ,  she must reach bottom  ( another figurative death ?  )  .  so cassavettes has her get so drunk that she can't walk and must crawl to her dressing room the night the play opens on broadway .  she resurrects herself  ( helping yourself out of such situations is also important to the film's theme )  and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of play for the better by improvising so that it contains some ray of hope for the aging character she's playing .  these scenes are funny and interesting .  cassavettes and rowlands actually did the play in front of live audiences ,  who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie .  the play they're doing also acts as contrast :  it's mainstream and self-serious about the issues it addresses ,  that is ,  until myrtle changes its denouement .  in doing so ,  she also improves the work of her co-stars .  the natural evolution of interaction  ( achieved through improvisation ) between and among human beings ,  subjective realism ,  and universal truth - these were cassavettes's concerns in making films .    gena rowlands is amazing throughout .  of course ,  she has that great face ,  and cassavettes  ( notoriously in love with her throughout their marriage )  treats us to numerous closeups of it so that we too can feel her emotions and that we know what's going on inside of her .  she makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul .  and this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time .  the film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention ,  but anyone with interest in good film-making and great acting will be rewarded .  someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies .  all others be forewarned .    seek out opening night if you've never seen it .  everyone in it is excellent ,  and it's one of cassavettes's best films . 
over the years i've seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies ,  and every one holds the same amount of entertainment ;  unfortanetley ,  the entertainment level is at a low .  sure ,  the action sequences were amusing ,  but that was pretty much it .  seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like ;  under siege ,  under siege 2 ,  and executive decision ( at least on the action standpoint )  ,  but during the past ten years ,  these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications .   on the more positive side ,  the movie did make good use of time ,  like some of the action sequences and use of wit .  just when the movie seemed to just drag on ,  a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter .  i honestly believe that more of segal's movies would do better if he wasn't the only one that fans recognize in the movie .  supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing ,  and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses ,  maybe the movie will get more popular results . 
fox's  " the true story of jesse james "   ( 1957 )  is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 tyrone power/henry fonda classic  " jesse james "  .  i'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters ,  the uneven direction of nicholas ray and the ham-fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it .   in the late thirties and forties tyrone power was fox's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head darryl zanuck started to groom newcomer robert wagner to take his place .  this was a major error on zanuck's part as wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement .  with the possible exceptions of  " broken lance "   ( 1954 )  and  " between heaven & hell "   ( 1956 )  it is hard to think of wagner distinguishing himself in anything !  also ,  jeffrey hunter was nothing more than a fox contract player before being assigned to play frank james to wagner's jesse in  " the true story of jesse james "  .  borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in john ford's classic  " the searchers "  .  but his playing here ,  along with wagner as the second half of the james brothers ,  is nothing short of boring .  neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles .  they totally miss the mark ,  lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by power and fonda in the original .  the movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay wagner ,  as the robin hood of the american west ,  comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever .  the supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as agnes moorhead barely getting a look in as ma james .   the best aspects of this uninvolving so-so western is the wonderful cinemascope/colour cinematography by the great joe mcdonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer leigh harline ! 
i pulled down a vhs box from my vast collection - many unseen - and picked out a movie ,  based on the box art ,  i thought would be fun ,  and yes ,  bad .  prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box .  i sat down and watched ,  and lo !  and behold !  ,  found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind .  fortunately ,  i reversed mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total .  prison tells the story of an old ,  dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns .  it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners .  the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film .  the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair .  we see lane smith as a guard - tearing away a crucifix before sending the man to his maker .  we then go to present day ,  first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re-opening the old prison .  then we see the new warden ,  lane smith ,  haunted by a nightmare in bed - and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years .  well ,  the rest follows suit :  prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding .  we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters .  the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a workmanlike job .  viggo mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid .  tom everett ,  tiny lister ,  and ivan kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters .  chelsea field is okay as the female lead .  the best performance is by lincoln kilpatrick ,  an underrated character actor ,  as cresus - a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the  " man "  had been executed "  with some kind of terrible secret .  prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that ,  but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it .  i was pleasantly surprised at the way director renny harlin created a story so visually atmospheric .  the film has a tense ,  taut pace and harlin knows how to build his scenes .  there are a few excessively shot gore scenes - the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes .  but these scenes are visually creative and interesting .  the acting is uniformly decent .  the script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these .  that may in part be credited to irwin yablans who wrote the story .  you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday .  here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is .  give prison a break ( get it )  . 
 .  .  . and you can look at that statement in different ways ,  by the way .  first of all ,  it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes .  your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here .  entire parts of this movie are just plain sick ,  disgusting ,  offensive ,  brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out .  now ,  i love horror movies and i am very 'pro-violence' ,  but i do think that it has to lead somewhere  !  !  is that too much to ask  ?  cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts .  the  " movie "  contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story .  this results in endless showing of torture ,  murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common .  not very informative ,  if you ask me .  and yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely has potential .  it's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial .  personally ,  i think that is an interesting topic ,  so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever .   secondly ,  the whole production of this movie was a mess .  they didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts .  .  . tons of it  !  !  the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst i've ever seen .  any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish  (  like that attempt to a realistic car crash ,  for example  )  .  there's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere .  .  . not even an attempt to build up one .   cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least .  with the presence of death-metal icon danni filth  (  from the band cradle of filth .  . get the link  ?   )  this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial .  troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this .  and then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing .  .  . bah .  i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind .  for every self-respecting horror fan ,  this movie is an insult . 
what a load of rubbish .  .  i can't even begin to describe how awful this film was .  the rating it has here is really hard to believe .   avoid .  .  .  particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps .  the first one was well written ,  well directed ,  well executed .  .  a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere .  the second one was 'alrite'- decent as a self-standing film ,  but clearly not up to the level of the first .  .  .  the third is an insult to the series ,  period .  i rate the films :  10 ,  6 ,  1 .  it's that bad .   oh ,  and yes it really is set in the past ,  the sisters are still called ginger and b fitzgerald .  .  .  all muddled in with some half-assed native american mythology .  the sisters don't have any real story ,  or progression ,  or even a clear relationship .  .  .  they're just trying to survive and be 'together forever' .  that's about as deep as it gets .   staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile-of-shite ,  after reading the script .   oh and another thing ,  staging of action was terrible- people appearing from nowhere regularly ,  like the girls turn around and there's an elaborate candle-lit setup with a mystic native american woman just sitting there ,  about to go into a speech .  sets were terrible ,  couldn't get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set ,  which really didn't help .  also ,  there was consistently snow outside the camp ,  but not a trace inside  (  .  . on the set )  .   arrghh ,  ,  ,  so bad !  i really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one . 
lifetime did it again .  can we say stupid ?  i couldn't wait for it to end .  the plot was senseless .  the acting was terrible !  especially by the teenagers .  the story has been played a thousand times !  are we just desperate to give actors a job ?  the previews were attractive and i was really looking for a good thriller . once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie ,  this isn't one of them .  unless one has nothing else to do i would avoid this one at all cost .  this was a waste of two hours of my life .  can i get them back ?  i would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide .  that would have been more entertaining . 
john carpenter's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication .  his excuse is that he only produced it .  jon bon jovi looks like a girl .  in fact ,  bon jovi and the two vampire girls ,  natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes .  in short ,  it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way .  bon jovi has the most charisma .  at least he looks happy when he is smiling .  the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints .  at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss ,  but stop .  amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires .  at one point ,  arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act .  it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof ,  and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening .  as far as gore is concerned ,  a few heads are ripped off ,  and the blood spurts profusely .  these scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny ,  and there is no  " horror "  pay-off from the scene .  all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of  " wow ,  that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls .  i wonder who has to clean it up .  "  throughout the movie ,  these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover  ( the top vampire in the world ?  ?  )  keep reaching out to her .  at one point ,  bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow  ( and has done so on other occasions )  ,  he says  " i am not trying to hurt you .  i just want to talk to you .  i want to get to know you .  "  huh ?  ?  of course ,  the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device .   " why can't we be friends "  the 1970s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie .  aside from all of the other silly moments ,  there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed ,  and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion .  i guess blood type is not important ?  anyhow ,  all her vampire blood is removed .  bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him ,  he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also .  of course ,  as the vampire blood is transfused into him ,  none of his healthy blood is removed .  so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body .  and just like the first vampires ,  this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect . 
if you ever have the chance to see sandra bernhard live in person ,  you better move on it sweetie .  i saw her last year in los angeles at the opening of her everything bad and beautiful tour and i still can't believe that i was in the first row ,  and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show .  she is now in new york with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner ,   " without you i'm nothing "  .  we have lost richard pryor ,  lenny bruce ,  nina simone ,  but sandra is still with us .  patti smith is missing in action ,  but not sandra .  barbara streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but sandra more than makes up for where babs leaves off .  okay ,  i want it known ,  ms .  bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more .  i really wanted to push this film because of its truth ,  honesty ,  humor ,  eclectic songs  ( ranging from laura nyro ,  sylvester ,  nina simone ,  prince )  ,  and a script that defines the decadence ,  joy ,  sadness ,  ups and downs of the 70's and 80's .  it is my opinion that many  ( and i mean ,  many )  comics have lifted ,  okay outright stolen ,  so much from this show if not from sandra herself .  i won't name names but come on ,  people ,  you and i know who they are .  see ,  the thing is ,  bernhard plays by her own rules .  this movie shows ,  as does her live performances ,  that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business ,  as well as pushing forward .  her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs  ( during the time of miles davis , coltrane , monk )  ,  70's tv shows ,  intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from judy garland to joan jett .  most comedians couldn't even touch where sandra is coming from or going to .  so ,  here i was ,  a year ago ,  watching sandra at the silent movie theater ,  in total awe and joy .  i wanted to meet her after the show ,  give her something that meant something to me ,  that ,  hopefully would mean something to her .  but i listen to my copy of giving til it hurts ,  and just thank her in a prayer ,  of sorts for making me laugh ,  making me think ,  making me feel .  you can't deny this lady's presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage .  she's still here ,  damn it ,  even after the release of without you i'm nothing ,  some 15 years ago .  and she looks great ,  by the way .  i know this firsthand ,  walking from the theater one audience member said to another ,   " she is so funny .  . and she still looks incredible !  !  !  if you can't experience her live yet ,  please see this movie .  as for me ,  i do hope that sandra will see this .  you've meant a heck of a lot to me ,  gotten me through some tough crazy times .  if you can send me an email ,  please do .  if not ,  knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so ,  is enough for me .  come on ,  people ,  give it up for the lady !  !  !  ! 
after reading the reviews ,  it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work .  how utterly boring .  oh how about the good ol' days and there was nothing like it .  of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other .   i grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with dan'l boone graced the saturday afternoon matinées .  this was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing ,  yapping ,  farting ,  giggling ,  snot monsters like myself or was-self .  and it was a movie theatre filler at the time .  almost as big as the wizard of oz .   imdb insists that every critique contains something about the plot .  problem is was that it was rather a template .  here goes .  randolph scott  ( cowboy/hero ) gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people .  hooray !    all of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it .  that was just about the plot line of every scott ,  john wayne ,  roy rogers film ever made .  if you take the time to go back and review each and every movie - just don't ask for surprises .   one must remember the context of the times .  there was no or little tv .  none for kids .  there was school .  there was the great outdoors .  there were toy guns .  no cyber time .  and the steam age had just collapsed .  but movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers .  even the girls got into it .   this movie was the entertainment .  and it is just as mindless as anything produced today .  it had a purpose originally of being propaganda .  but quickly came to be kids movies .   our fathers had experienced the real thing .  and it wouldn't be until sam peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities .  not until his directorship did anyone die slowly ,  with great pain and miserably .  until peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair .  thanks sam .   to see a movie had little or no blood ,  the adults didn't mind .  they wouldn't have tolerated it i think .  no guts spraying the shattering plant life .  so this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory .  gung ho was suitable for kids then .   you will see that i assigned a four to this rating .  why would i do that ?  well .  it is a terrible movie .  no matter how i love it .  i do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood .  but it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms .  basically gung ho transitted to become a romance novel for children .   should people watch it .  of course .  i am not saying to stay away .  realistically however .  the plot is simple .  the characters shallow ?  they are shoals .  you can love a bad movie . 
yes ,  the plot is hardly plausible and very thin .  yes ,  the acting does range from average to laughable .  yes ,  it has been done so many times before .  however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is .  there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie .  in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing .  i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be ;  a scary ,  funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none . 
the  " documentary "  ,  and we use that term loosely apparently ,  summarizes that muslims are trying to violently take over the world .  then states that any muslim that doesn't admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face !  also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them .  what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets .  if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle-east i would look elsewhere .  try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources . 
scarecrows is one of those films that ,  with a little more acting ,  a little more direction ,  and a lot more story logic ,  would have been quite compelling as a horror entry .  as it stands ,  it is still a creepy film that has solid make-up and gore effects ,  and a premise that sustains the mood of terror in spite of itself .  and hey ,  there are no teenagers getting killed one by one--just dumb adults ,  so that is a refreshing change of pace .  and the plot line is amazingly similar to dead birds ,  with a precipitating robbery ,  an abandoned spooky house in the middle of nowhere ,  and demonic monsters .  but just like dead birds ,  the adults are still witless ,  they run around cluelessly before getting slaughtered one by one ,  and they ignore the obvious danger .   in scarecrows ,  though ,  we never really find out the supernatural why ,  and that sustains the atmosphere of creepiness .  and like clowns ,  scarecrows can be very creepy ;  unless they look like ray bolger ,  of course .  escaping in a hijacked plane with the pilot and his daughter ,  after a robbery netting millions ,  a para-military bunch is double-crossed by one of their own ;  a very nervous guy named burt .  he jumps out of the plane with the big ,  and heavy ,  box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground .  being the dumbest of the bunch ,  he is murdered first .  but not before he happens upon the fowler residence ,  nestled snuggly amid lots of really creepy-looking scarecrows ,  and surrounded with a wooden fence encircled with barbed-wire and lots of warnings to stay away .  and the weird weathervane on the roof ,  with the pitchfork and pterodactyl ,  should have been a warning sign ,  too .  the inside of the house is also quite foreboding  ( to us in the audience ,  anyway )  .   annoyingly ,  we must listen to burt's thoughts in voice-over ,  as he walks around and mysteriously comes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard .  the way the key pops up would be enough to have my pants--with me in them--flying out the door .  perhaps it's just me ,  but i really enjoy watching people's lips move on screen ,  even when they are just thinking out loud .  it helps to intensify the action ,  and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voice-over is saying .  burt hoists the box onto the truck and makes his getaway .  sure why not ?  decrepit trucks always have lots of gas in them ,  especially with today's prices ,  and the battery ?  no problem .  now ,  i did mention that burt was the dumbest of the bunch ,  and here is why  ( in addition to the above ,  of course )  .  wearing night-vision goggles to walk through the foliage and find the house ,  he takes them off to drive the truck away ,  and instead ,  turns on the headlights to see where he is going .  of course ,  the crooks still in the plane spot the headlights of his truck ,  and know where he is headed .  brilliant .  he deserves to die .  definitely .  i am not sure why he needed night vision goggles in the first place ,  as every scene is brightly lit ,  from the interior of the plane ,  to the night-time outside scenery ,  and the house .  the cinematographer was either a .  myopic ,  b .  just out of school ,  or c .  dealing with really cheap filmstock .   burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere .  go figure .  one very nice touch ,  and there are ,  i must admit ,  a few in the film ,  is the fact that when he opens the truck's lid ,  there is no engine .  creepy ,  to be sure  ( and insert pants comment again here )  .  the story logic fails when dead ,  now-stuffed-like-a-flounder-with-money-and-straw-burt returns to the house .  the rest of the bunch are there ,  rough him up ,  then realize that he is indeed dead ,  and was gutted and stuffed like a flounder with money and straw .  dead burt does manage to put up quite a fight ,  though ,  and grabs one fellow by the mouth ,  pushing him through a window ,  causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a gorylicious scene .  at this point ,  you would think they'd would be racing out of the house and back to the plane--but noooo ,  they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money .  in fact ,  the whole burt is dead episode is treated rather matter-of-factly ,  although one bright bulb in the bunch does argue ,   " burt was walking around dead ,  for chrissakes !  "   the stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house ,  and the crooks blithely go for the bait .  soon ,  another one of them ,  jack ,  is dispatched ,  and again the scene is well done and horrific ,  involving a dull handsaw and no anethesia .  now there are three scarecrows going about wreaking mayhem ,  and one of them needs a hand ,  literally .   when one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and jack getting scarecrow-ized ,  he starts screaming ,  running away like hell ,  and shooting off his gun in typical para-military fashion .  so much for all that training under pressure crap .  he meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming ,  running away like hell ,  and shooting off his gun ,  even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him .  again ,  that script logic thing .  .  .  dead and gutted ,  jack returns to the house ,  and goes after the screamer with the usual results .  if you listen to jack's demonic growl ,  by the way ,  you may notice ,  depending on your age ,  that it is the same monster-growling sound heard often in the lost in space tv episodes .   the last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane ,  barely escaping .  but do they ?  you will have to see the film to find out . 
in the standard view ,  this is a purely awful movie .  however ,  it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale .  i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie .  andy griffith's ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime .  i wouldn't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it ,  but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on tv ,  check it out . 
i am dumbfounded that i actually sat and watched this .  i love independent films ,  horror films ,  and the whole zombie thing in general .  but when you add ninga's ,  you've crossed a line that should never be crossed .  i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it ,  then at least it wasn't a total waste .  you'd never know by watching it though .  script ?  are you kidding .  acting ?  i think even the trees were faking .  cinematography ?  well ,  there must've been a camera there .  period .  i don't think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie .  such a total waste of time that i won't prolong it by commenting further . 
judging by the hype ,  and other reviews on this site ,  i was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies .  what i got was complete crap focusing on junkies .  i wonder if there's another movie called  " cookers "  that these people reviewed ?  there are only 3 main characters ,  and none of them struck me as well-written or well-acted .  basically the whole movie i just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addicts .   do yourself a favor .  don't rent this movie .  rent  " cabin fever "  or some other decent horror movie .  hell ,  rent  " mary poppins "  !  the animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything you'll find in  " cookers .  " 
 " igor and the lunatics "  is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie .  apparently even nearly twenty years later ,  charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmakers .  this is a typical troma production ,  meaning in other words ,  there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot .  there's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at .   " igor and the lunatics "  is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice ,  like the circle saw killing for example .  the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul .  one of paul's lower ranked disciples ,  named igor ,  becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity .  just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is :  he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl !  there's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks ,  like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences .  maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete .  for no particular reason ,  the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds . 
there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence .  one of those few is judy davis ,  who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart .  she takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery ,  deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen .   her skills are well displayed in  " high tide ,  "  a film that matches her up a second time with director gillian armstrong ,  who gave davis her first major success with  " my brilliant career .  "  in that film ,  davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world ,  despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing .  in  " high tide ,  "  however ,  davis' character ,  lillie ,  is roughly the opposite :  she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young ,  and ,  after giving birth to a child ,  runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning .  when she finally meets up with her daughter years later ,  the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying ;  she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures ,  but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect ?   gillian armstrong's films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other ,  but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions .   " oscar and lucinda ,  "  for instance ,  was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance ,  represented by their gambling addictions .  here ,  we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother's inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it's too late to change for the better .  this is not simply a film with a great performance at its center ,  but also a rare achievement :  a fully convincing story of redemption . 
i have seen this wonderful production ,  and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife-i am not sure of her character's name .  i went to byu with her and lost touch with her-her maiden name was kim luke-and i wonder if anyone has any info on her .  she is not listed in the credits .  this production was outstanding ,  a tear-jerker on all accounts ,  superb acting by all .  i guess i don't even want to put it in the general category of 'acting' ,  more like 'portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final dispensation' .  .  .  .  . something like that .  if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know !  !  !  she was fantastic in her role ,  by the way .  .  .  . thanks ,  melissa thorne
i was curious to watch this movie .  a lot of people seem to be excited .  i also have my beliefs .  i believe in jesus christ but i'm opened for any kind of views or opinions .  it doesn't matter for me ,  if jesus existed in the way it's written in the bible .  if maria was a virgin or not ,  or all the other similar pagan coincidences .  what matters for me is the idea of salvation ,  the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world .   what made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence ,  present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written .  for example ,  they showed in this movie following sentence big :   " those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me "  jesus  ( lukas 19 : 27 )  what they didn't tell you is the context .  jesus told a story about an evil king .  there is no passage in the bible where jesus supports killing .  he is love !  after quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people  ( pseudo-christians )  filled with hate .  the majority of viewers don't check the informations presented so they start thinking jesus=hate=not good for me or for anybody else .  this is pure manipulation people .  please use your brain .  don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie .  we destroy our own basis ,  our civilization if we start dismantling jesus in this way and the message he brought to us .  you saw off the branch you're sitting on . 
this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value .  it gets quite hysterically funny at times ,  but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts .   the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles .  how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played .  she's a true lady .  and ,  my favorite is grace's white pimp suit that she wears .   i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud ,  who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different . 
i just watched this movie on showtime .  quite by accident actually .  if i wouldn't have only had 6 hrs of sleep for the past two days then i wouldn't have came home early from work .  if i hadn't came home early from work i wouldn't have seen this movie .  i wouldn't have known what i was missing ,  but i would've missed a lot .   that's the way this movie is .  it's almost playing on the kevin bacon effect .  that and causality  ( hence my verbiage above )  .  ever character is intertwined in some way or another .  action ,  reaction ,  interaction ,  non-interaction .  this movie is just wonderful .  i'm going to have to find a copy to buy . 
re :  pro jury  although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful ,  the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story .   one may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old's they barely know ,  but i doubt it .    " easily give away virginity "  ?  what a shrewd remark about this film .  truly .   one may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations ,  but my experience has been ,  more often than not ,  teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world .   you just aren't at all able to see the world other than through your own eyes ?  that's sad .   one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake ,  but i think not .    and another  " expert "  opinion drawn from experience .  dandy .   one may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into ,  and hang around inside ,  a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble ,  but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents ,  chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this .   now be a good sport and tell us at which institution you grew up .   one final nit ,  throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome .  there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome ,  but because it was never detailed ,  each reference distracts from each scene .   of course there's probably an explanation .  good job figuring that out !  now i'll be generous and will help you out of your misery :  although it was translated as a general  " foursome "  ,  the word  " &#269 ; etvorka "  has another meaning :  it's a sports term used to designate a 4m or 4w setup - a rowing crew consisting of 5 persons :  4 rowers and a coxswain .   this movie did not ring true for me .   we should all heed to your competent and praiseworthy opinion .  dude . 
our teacher showed us this movie in first grade .  i haven't seen it since .  i just watched the trailer though .  does this look like a first grade movie to you ?  i don't think so .  i was so horrified by this movie ,  i could barely watch it .  it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half ,  and then there was the boy with ketchup !  i was freaked out by this film .  now today ,  being 20 ,  i probably would not feel that way .  i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie ,  even though it's pg .  be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids .  i don't even remember what it was about ,  once was enough ! 
 " fear of a black hat "  is everything the  ( much weaker )   " cb-4 "  should have been .  rusty cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless ,  as he folds ,  spindles ,  and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture .  does  " foabh "  resemble spinal tap ?  yes ,  a bit .  is it derivative of spinal tap ?  no ,  not really .  the aim is more focused ,  the satire is better focused ,  and to be honest ,  it's funnier . 
this is an extraordinary film ,  that tricks you constantly .  it seems to be heading toward cliche at several points ,  and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles .  it would give away too much to say much more ,  but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded .  william haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered .  the gay subtext in his relationship with jack pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where haines rubs pickford's chest  ( pickford has a cold )  .  both actors play this sub-text subtlely and with great depth of emotion ,  so that there are moments that are very moving .  and i never thought i could get so involved in a football match as i did in this movie - and i don't even understand the rules !  also excellent is francis x .  bushman's son ralph as haines' rival for the girl  ( yes ,  it's not completely a gay movie )  .  wonderful silent classic - a great example of twenties commercial cinema with an edge . 
we viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating .  not knowing anything about this true story ,  i thought :   " oh ,  no ,  p . brosnan as an american indian  ( 'red' indian in the film )  ,  what a bad choice "  until i discovered the truth about grey owl .  the film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them .  and annie galipeau ,  wow ,  what a beauty ,  and very convincing as an indian woman  ( i believe she is french-canadian ;  she sure reverts to the all-too familiar speech of such )  .  in spite ,  of brosnan's detached ,  grunting style ,  in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate ,  dedicated man .  the plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist .  good film ,  highly recommended . 
the same night that i watched this i also watched  " scary movie 4 ,  "  making for one messed up double feature .  unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise .  while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid ,  brutally dated and brutally bad ,  the more recent parody had me laughing out loud .  how could i desire any more than that .  director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers .  but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day .  the script reeks of stoner humor ,  and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea .  i ,  sober ,  was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato .  and that one joke ,  that is never funny ,  where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here .  some may giggle ,  i did not .  they even had a hitler joke that wasn't funny ,  and i thought all hitler jokes were funny .   the narrative of this film is so splintered  ( for no good reason )  that it is nearly impossible to explain .  tomatoes kill people ,  the government tries to stop it ,  bad jokes are told .  their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media ,  consumerism ,  and paranoia  ( three things that still control our lives today )  .  oddly enough the main selling point of this film ,  those gosh darn tomatoes ,  really don't make much of an appearance .  and when they do ,  get this ,  they're played by real tomatoes .  that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks .  there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny .  the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members ,  but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun .   i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here .  man eats tomato and that's dinner ,  tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe .  but that is just the way the world works .  in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification ,  but in the real world our produce  ( see :  taco bell )  becomes evil thanks to neglect .  and like those evil doin' green onions this film's shelf life expired a long time ago .  there are a few good chuckles to be had .  the last shot was really quite splendid ,  but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb .  i'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept ,  but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there .  and by  " there "  i mean to the level of  " scary movie 4 .  "  **1/4
high school friends andre kriegman and cal gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their high school .  as they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge ,  the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission .   there is another similar movie like this ,  called  " elephant .  "  why do i bring this up ?  to compare the two films ,  of course .  i have to say ,  even though i liked  " elephant ,  "  this is a much better film .  what's the difference ,  you ask ?  well ,  for starters ,  this is shot differently ,  much along the lines of  " cloverfield ,  "   " blair witch project ,  "  and  " diary of the dead .  "  this makes the movie all the better because it's much more painfully realistic .   but what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the  " other side of the story .  "  you get to know these two shooters ,  unlike  " elephant .  "  i actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did .  this movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white .   to be honest ,  this is why i almost cried in this movie .  the characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions .  you get to understand them .  it's not like they want to kill people for attention .  overall ,  this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than  " elephant .  " 
sophia loren plays aida ,  in one of the worst films of all time .  she can't lipsync .  in terms of production values ,  the film is so bad ,  that at one point ,  while loren is mouthing  " o patria mia ,  "  she leans onto what looks to be a stone wall for support ,  and the canvas set billows and shakes . 
i really think i should make my case and have every ( horror and or cult ) movie-buff go and see this movie .  .  .   i did !   it-is-excellent :  very atmospheric and unsettling and scary .  .  .   incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low ( read- " no "  !  ) -budget they had .  .  .  .   synopsis taken from website :   " one morning ,  an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat .  he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse .  .  .  "   on this website ( imdb )  there is no trailer ,  but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out .  .  .   www . softfordigging . com
what an insult to the sa film industry !  i have seen better sa films .  the comments i read about hijack stories , by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary .  a movie's rating should not depend on .  .  ,   " oh ,  a movie from a developing country .  lets boost their industry by saying nice things about their work ,  even though it is bad .  "  we have the expertise to make good movies .  don't judge the film industry on what people say how great they think hijack stories is .  we can tell great stories such as cry the beloved country and shaka zulu .  cry the beloved country i'll give 9 out of 10 .  great directing by darryl ,  great acting by two great elderly actors ,  irrespective from where they are .  hijack stories .  .  ,  i'll give 1 out of 10 .  it could only be people involved in the project who would give it high scores .  i would've done the same if it was my movie . 
if there's one genre that i've never been a fan of ,  it's the biopic .  always misleading ,  filled with false information ,  over-dramatized scenes ,  and trickery all around ,  biopics are almost never done right .  even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese  ( the aviator )  and ron howard  ( a beautiful mind )  ,  they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen .  skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different .  some critics and moviegoers objected to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page ,  saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part .  i never doubted mol could handle the part since ,  but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago .  mol delivers a knockout oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin-up girl ,  who ,  after an early life of abuse  ( depicted subtlety and tastefully done ,  something few directors would probably do )  inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time .  the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots ,  there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story .  director/co-writer marry harron and guinevere turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending .  still ,  credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully .  come oscar time ,  mol ,  turner ,  and harron should be receiving nominations .  doubt it will happen ,  though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them .  9/10
if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie ,  it's got to be pretty good .  i'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist .  i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end ,  then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death  ( the english patient ,  shakespeare in love ,  atonement ,  crash .  this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end .  acting is great ,  story is absolutely original ,  flash-back technique very affective .  there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him ,  but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to ,  rather than a rip-off of ,  orson . 
this independent ,  b&w ,  dv feature consistently shocks ,  amazes and amuses with it's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them .  it's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff ,  yet as absurd as much of the film should be ,  there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded ,  keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here .  this film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad .  that seems to be the heart of the film .  for as insane and off the wall as things get ,  leon ,  the 30 yr .  old paperboy-protagonist ,  always tries to keep it together .  he's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best ,  so that everyone can have what they want .   the acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive .  van meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics .  just as the characters in the film do ,  we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath .    majkowski is a true genius here .  he takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real .  it is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat .  it's a true testament to the skill of majkowski and all involved that this film ,  with it's grating plot and characters ,  never once works our nerves .  majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant ,  and somehow given it heart and humor .  this is a unique film .  not to be missed .    
this was one of the best movies i have seen .  the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part .  although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget ,  i found it to be exhilarating to watch .   some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction .  however ,  when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters ,  there is no direction is life .  i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations .   most of the cast are newcomers to the industry .  however ,  they all pulled it off very well .  everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately .   i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control .  this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways . 
the idea ia a very short film with a lot of information .  interesting ,  entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more .  the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that i have seen .  i have rated this film at the highest possible rating .  i also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment .  what comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to ,  their voice is never heard .  it is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward .  i hope that the produced will produce a second part to this 'idea' .  i look forward to viewing the sequence .  once again congrats to halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind . 
the director tries to be quentin tarantino ,  the screenwriters try to be tennessee williams ,  deborah kara unger tries to be faye dunaway ,  the late james coburn tries to be orson welles ,  michael rooker tries to be gene hackman ,  mary tyler moore tries to be faye dunaway  ( older version )  ,  cameron diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can  ( successfully )  ,  don't ask about joanna going .  eric stoltz and james spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff .  it delivers endless ,  meaningless dialog and very little action .   tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies ,  an art deco church by bruce goff and a lovely ,  sprawling mansion by frank lloyd wright .  visit tulsa ,  don't watch this movie .  it doesn't do the location justice . 
i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film ,  and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed .  it made much of the fact that the film was  " by the director of cube "  and made it look like a horror film ,  when in fact it is an absurdist comedy  ( imdb's spell checker doesn't seem to think that absurdist is a word ,  but it is )  ,  reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead .   i love the way the story builds up slowly at first ,  then gradually escalates .  i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film .  that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube .  i recommend it . 
let me be clear .  i've used imdb for years .  but only today i went through the trouble of registering on the site ,  just so i could give this movie the lowest possible rating .  i've seen hundreds of films ,  some of them bad ,  a few awful .  never ,  though ,  have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence ,  of high intentions and failure .   mira sorvino is horribly cast as the princess ,  but entirely unbelievable as phocion ,  a young boy .  fiona shaw is always an entertaining character ,  but the dialogue in the film is much worse ,  even ,  than in the insipid french play that is the source  ( marivaux never reached hollywood until now ,  and we should keep it that way )  .   to illustrate ,  for example ,  that leontine is a brilliant ,  passionate philosopher and scientist ,  she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker ,  shouting out names of famous scientists .  and the romance between agis and the princess is played even sillier .  for this ,  the pair should receive a joint 'clair danes' award ,  which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990's  ( see miss danes in les miserables )  .   aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue ,  there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming .  for example ,  there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action ,  sitting in chairs ,  watching the principal characters .  the director wants us to realize she's adapted a play .  i get it .  but it doesn't happen at all until far into the film .  at that point ,  seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment ,  then disappearing ,  is creepy and distracting .  they're like some sort of un-scary zombie crowd ,  appearing through the mists ,  filling us with dread .  when you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie ,  you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes .   -matthew mcguire
kiera nightly moved straight from the p&p set to this action movie .  .  .  she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically .  a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen's classic ,  she is ,  once again ,   " having a go "  .  just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle ,  it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life .  .  .  but then this is exactly what domino harvey  ( the real one )  did ,  and i  ( being one of nightly's biggest fans )  believe she carries if off .   stuff .  .  .  .   * 90210  ( for the non american world )  is the post code of beverly hills in la ,  where all the film stars live .  * domino harvey father's mostfamous film was manchurian candidate  ( which appears in the film )  .  * domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june 2005 ,  after having been arrested for drug dealing .  she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film .  * kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey's sexuality in her interview with lucy liu .   if you find this film a bit far fetched ,  then check out domino harvey ,  as the facts are more amazing than the fiction . 
gandhi my father is a well made movie .  it nicely portrays the life of gandhiji's eldest son harilal .  his character ,  his differences with his father ,  his love for his family ,  his desire to stand on his own ,  his failure ,  his ego .  .  akshaye khanna completely justifies the role of harilal .  just not him ,  everyone did well in the roles they played .  darshan jariwala is the best on-screen gandhiji i've ever seen .  but i will cut three points as there were few shortcomings .   first ,  movie was fifteen-twenty minutes longer than it should have .  second ,  the movie needed more research into harilal's character .  somewhere ,  the character looked incomplete .  also ,  his relation with his brothers was not shown .  there was no mention of any other child of gandhiji in the whole movie .  i believe the character like harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well ,  considering the egoist nature of harilal .   anyways ,  despite some shortcomings ,  i liked the movie .  recommended .  .  . 
my sincere advice to all :  don't watch the movie .   don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played !  !  even a glimpse of it is bad for health .  serious .  no jokes .  it's 3 . 30 am in the morning .  and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe .  four hours damn !  !  !  i am proud that i survived after all of it !  if this is called survival .   i am highly frustrated .  annoyed .  disappointed .  it was sheer waste of time !  money went in drain !  no plot .  hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night !  !  rubbish movie .   happy republic day to one and all  :  ) 
i've been trying to find out about this series for ages !  thank you ,  imdb !  i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind .  as a 6-year old ,  of course ,  i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops ,  which was absolutely chilling  ( i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine ,  which i still have )  what i also remember ,  though ,  was the atmosphere ,  which was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious ,  austere ,  and extremely authentic .  when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation .  it's a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in hollywood .  every 'odyssey' i've seen since has been an enormous let-down .  the characters in this series seemed genuine ,  real people - ancient greek people - and not some hollywood stars in costumes .  this is a real masterpiece !  but - why is it not better known ?  and why isn't it available on vhs or dvd ?  i would just love to have the chance to see this again ! 
this film was excellent ,  i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre .  this one however got all the ingredients ,  a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars !  i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi ,  and he sure did that a lot  :  ) 
i wonder how the actors acted in this movie .  annette bening was really herself ,  half in and half out ,  was she faking or being natural ?  it didn't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film .  brian cox acted really well .  i almost thought that he had always acted this way ,  tricky ,  dishonest ,  in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene .  as for gwyneth paltrow ,  the question is what she was doing in this film .   this film is quite sickening and disgusting .  who would pay to see such a crap ? 
wanda nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls .  script ,  pacing ,  and direction are uniformly awful .  action sequences defy belief .  characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set ,  but also includes multiple sexual references involving shields' character as well as graphic deaths .    the movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny ,  an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid ,  and a children's movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities .  it also wants to be a buddy picture ,  a coming of age picture ,  a ghost movie ,  an indian spiritual movie ,  a travelogue ,  and a western .  the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist .  wanda nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the grand canyon .  that it manages to do just fine . 
the story :  young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness .  she ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg .  in the institution she meets park il-sun ,  a young man who develops a bond with her .   if you're reading this you probably already know how talented chan-wook park is .  but 'i'm a cyborg .  .  . ' is a big departure from familiar ,  and  ( sadly )  stronger territory .  i'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different .  god knows ,  we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas .  the main point about the movie i need to say is ,  that it fails to say anything about mental illness ,  or create a characters that you care about .   this story has to be one of the weirdest things i've seen in years .  .  . but weird isn't enough .  there's no heart to the movie .  .  . just surrealism and confusion .  confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie .  the characters all try to make sense of their own problems ,  but it's chan-wook park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all . 
old movie buffs will know why i'd call this one  " the man in the grey flannel robe .  "  most bible-based movies are basically schlock- what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how peck ,  tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying neanderthals all about him .  as a great romance ,  it falls flat as unleavened bread .  but there is something gripping about this movie .  of all the big hollywood bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the average american towards belief in the biblical god .  billy sunday's thesis is duking it out with h . l .  mencken's antithesis all through the script .  who gets the better of it in the heavenly chorus-backed synthesis depends on your point of view .  other than that ,  d & b boasts a good performances by peck  (  especially in the closing repentance scene )  and by jayne meadows as his bitter first wife michol ,  vivid ,  moody atmosphere  ( good idea to set most action at dawn or night )  ,  and the rousing rendition of the twenty-third psalm at the end . 
anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast ,  script ,  and director can put together a comedy masterpiece .  by the same token ,  it's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid hollywood bore-a-thon !  this movie was pathetic !  had it not been for john cleese  ( a comic genius )  ,  i would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid .   neil simon wouldn't write another screenplay for this version  ( he said that he couldn't improve on the first )  ,  and i'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldn't sue for defamation of humor !   jack lemmon and sandy dennis did such a wonderful job in the original ,  what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one ?  how could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny ?  i don't know ,  but one thing i do know---it's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
firstly let me say that i didn't like the fact that the rock won the title that is so gay .  next i feel regal should have got back his european title ,  jeff hardy is a crappy champ .  rob van dam had the intercontinental title too long already brock should have won it .  i am pleased with storm and christian being tag champs ,  best match was the booker t and big show match in my opinion . 
i was lucky to see  " oliver !  "  in 1968 on a big cinema screen in boston when i was a young teenager .  later ,  during the summer of 1969 ,  i was pleased to see this film was still playing at a prominent cinema in leicester square ,  london ,  after it had won the academy award for best picture of the previous year .   th success of  " oliver !  "  on both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent begins on broadway and ends in hollywood .  this legendary story by charles dickens ,  which is part of the literary heritage of all english-speaking people ,  was admirably brought to the london stage by lionel bart of great britain .  his charming musical then became a hit in new york and throughout the world .  the film adaptation was made in england during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968 .  the sets and musical numbers are mind boggling .  the song  " who will buy ?  "  required hundreds of actors and the british film director truly deserved his oscar for putting it all together in a seamless manner .  some canadian and american talent is also part of this wonderful production ,  but mostly it is a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of the british film studios ,  such as shepperton .  good show !  other film studios at elstree ,  boreham wood ,  bray ,  denham ,  and ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years . 
glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made .   the film makes you care about each member of this fox family ,  from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic .  set against an inhospitable countryside ,  the audience's hearts warm to the family members .   the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms .   man remains one of the biggest predators ,  but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living ,  not just surviving beyond human endeavours . 
part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson  ( 2 reasons enough to watch )  ,  was a period piece and involved chess .  everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected .  i shan't ,  therefore ,  give away much more .  suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric ,  obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him .  it's about love and obsession ,  rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour ,  became totally compelling .  and i defy anyone to second-guess the ending . 
pretty good film from preminger ;  labyrinthine at times ,  as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live .  in this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying ,  as its hero ,  a good cop with a bad temper ,  gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head .   dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet ,  and has never been better .  the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight ,  and almost raises it to the level of tragedy .  as his girl ,  gene tierney is attractive but unremarkable .  gary merrill makes for a very interesting villain ,  with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to andrews' coolness ;  his smiling ,  amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open ,  as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him .    there are no major surprises in this film ,  which seems transitional for all concerned .  for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars ,  andrews and tierney ,  who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made .  the supporting cast , --merrill ,  karl malden ,  neville brand--are ,  understandably ,  more optimistic ,  as they were all on their way up .  preminger ,  as serene an observer as ever ,  lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view ,  as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing ,  for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain ,  much less resolve .   
 " intensive care "  by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made . this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations . a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor bruckner . the acting is abysmal , the action is slow and the climax is laughable . a famous surgeon has a car accident . he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage .  " intensive care "  is clearly influenced by american slasher films including  " halloween "  and  " friday the 13th "  series . the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid . still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look . you'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me ! 
on the surface ,  this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation ,  that is how to become a true self by embracing the so-called 'dark' side of human nature .  thus ,  we have the darkling ,  a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company  ( that is ,  recognition )  of men ,  and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled ,  more or less successfully .    however ,  if we dig a little deeper ,  we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person :  - in the opening scene ,  the main character  ( male car mechanic fallen from grace ) is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter ,  when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl .  lesson #1 :  cars are persons embodied with immortal souls ,  and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery .  the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished .  - just after that ,  another character  ( rubin )  buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once-lost-now-found famous race-car and is warned by the salesman .  lesson #2 :  just like any other person ,  a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced .  in addition ,  there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk ,  but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin's own personal greed for more profit .  lesson #3 :  thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only ,  but always as an end in itself .  - then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and ,  more importantly ,  rubin's car :  the main character's assessment of the car's qualities is not just based on its outer appearance ,  but also by a thorough look inside the engine room .  lesson #4 :  a car is not just to be judged by its looks ,  it is what is inside that really counts .  there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind ,  as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector's car .  this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson #3 .    there are numerous other examples in the movie of the 'car=person'-theme ,  and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them ,  but the point remains  ( and i guess this is what i'm really trying to say )  that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do - or ,  if you're a car devotee . 
a scientist  ( john carradine--sadly )  finds out how to bring the dead back to life .  however they come back with faces of marble .  eventually this all leads to disaster .   boring ,  totally predictable 1940s outing .  this scared me silly when i was a kid but just bores me now .  i had to struggle to stay awake !  with one exception ,  the acting is horrible .  such expressionless boring actors !  hopeless .   there are some good things about this :  carradine ,  despite the script ,  actually gives a very good performance .  and there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a great dane walking through walls .  there's also one of the worst-looking knockouts in cinema history .  still ,  none of this is fun enough to sit through this .  avoid . 
beautiful film ,  pure cassavetes style .  gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress ,  dealing with success ,  aging ,  loneliness .  .  . and alcoholism .  she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts ,  embodied by the death spectre of a young girl .  acceptance of oneself ,  of human condition ,  though its overall difficulties ,  is the real purpose of the film .  the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling :  it's like if the stage became a way out for the heroin .  if all american movies could only be that top-quality ,  dealing with human relations on an adult level ,  not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings .  .  .  one of the best dramas ever .  10/10 . 
full house is a great family show .  however ,  after watching some episodes over and over again i've realized that they're incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot .  yes ,  there is a lot of comedy ,  but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy .  it's not like i hate it ,  but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick .  probably the best season is the first .   full house is about widower danny tanner ( bob saget ) and his three daughters d . j .   ( candace cameron )  stephanie  ( jodie sweetin )  and michelle  ( mary-kate and ashley )  .  when danny's wife dies the he is in need of some help .  so ,  his best friend joey  ( dave coulier )  and the girls' uncle jesse  ( john stamos )  moves in with them .  once they live there together they find they can't live without each other .    full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again . 
to compare this squalor with an old ,  low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old ,  low budget porno flick .  the animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions .  the synopsis on the back of the dvd case says in part ,   " gripping retelling of the btk killer's reign of terror .  "  this is not a retelling .  a retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why .  none of these things are true .  i'm an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly ,  this is not one of them .  this isn't even about the btk killer .  save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent dahmer instead .  that serial killer movie is accurate and true .  however ,  if you just have to see this movie for yourself ,  check it out for free at your local library and even then ,  you'll still feel cheated . 
i want to add to the praise for the production of this film ,  especially the luminous cinematography .  firelight glistening off of smooth and muscled skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery .  the film was nominated for  ( and won )  a single oscar - the first given for editing .  mala's performance is moody ,  penetrating and powerful . 
warning :  this review contains minor spoilers .   well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas .  i'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare .  tremors 4 :  the legends begins ,  however ,  is a very dull movie .  where the heck are the graboids ?  ?  ?    due to the relative lack of graboids through the first 90 minutes i'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a  " character study "  .  unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago's character who is given too few lines ,  too little to do and in the end too little screen time .  what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer .  whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch .  however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute .    on the plus side when the graboids  ( dirt dragons in this movie )  are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets .   i was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long .  pretty good for straight to video .  but after watching it i'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long .  there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any .  was there a rush to get this movie made ?  i think not ,  more time could have and should have been spent on the script .   i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 packaged for sale with .  .  .  . tremors !  !  !  what luck i thought ,  pay for #4 get #1 for free .  well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free ,  i can't imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4 .  for fans of the series it's best to forget that tremors 4 :  the legend begins even exists .   tremors 4 :  the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10 . 
i don't know why ,  but after all the hype on npr i thought this was a new movie .  .  .  .  . all the best footage has been used for bbc docs and natgeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs .  .  . it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth day-there are great moments ,  and it is always nice to listen to darth vader .  .  .  .  .  .  . oops ,  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  james earl jones speak ,  but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie  ,  considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film .  .  .  .  .  . it has been sanitized for a child audience ,  so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube  .  .  .  . i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as koyannisquatsi  ( sic )  and this movie is certainly not it
this really is one of the worst movies ever made .  i consider myself a huge zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting ,  lame  " special effects "  a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies ,  as long as the film has a good atmosphere/story/suspension or whatever to offer .  this one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate ,  maybe worse .  some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week´s holiday and definitely did a better job  ( no zombie film though )  .   this flick is not even funny ,  not speaking of anything else .  really bad and redundant special effects ,  zombies that look like normal people  ( except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces )  ,  way to much fake blood  ( i like realism a lot ,  the combination of realism and zombie films being debatable ,  but the presented gore is just plain silly )  .  the camera stays quite long with feedings scenes ,  it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder ,  why the zombies use weapons  (  !  )  to kill their prey .  i will not go into the details of the dubbing  ( others have done so )  .  although i am from germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version ,  i will not waste more of my time with this movie .   keep away from it ,  as far as you can . 
when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow .   1 ) the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local .  dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens .  what ,  who ,  how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst .  2 ) the van will break down .  3 ) whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about . 4 ) they will find a house inhabited by a madman ,  he will capture them .  5 )  the house will have a phone but it will not work ,  it will be disturbingly decorated ,  there will be flickering neon light ,  spiders and maggots .  6 ) the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start  ( here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor )  .  7 ) the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap ,  weak scare and will then be killed properly .  8 ) only a girl will be left alive from the group .  9 ) there will be an unnecessary twist at the end .    add to these elements naked sirens  ( who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately )  that seduce and kill the teens ,  throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie .   i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film ,  darkhunters ,  which is one of the worst films i have ever seen .  at times the cinematography is very good ,  the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies .  i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity .  however ,  the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film ,  it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again ,  but amongst the dvd extras .   if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief .  there is more to say about this than the film itself .  one staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea .  he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if  " people will get it "  .    i'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough ,  acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work .  if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question ;   " what was the point ?  "  this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies ,  any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked .   the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats .  they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use .  however ,  the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary .  there is a simple distinction to be made here ;  mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style ,  roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures  .  i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant .   the best moment is reserved for robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film .  those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that .  i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule .  the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers ,  complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born .  as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting ,  they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant .   the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast .  robert's swears blind in voice over ,  'i didn't want to make a film that was like baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground .  there is also a simpering ,  self-indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is  " the best british film in years "  .  i don't know who he is trying to convince .  at one point in the commentary track robert's says jokingly  " i can see people sitting at home saying  " this isn't amazing ,  its sh$t "  he isn't wrong . 
i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondie , romantic interest or damsel in danger . but , everything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie l . a .  confidential , and i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance . however , after that moment , her career did not follow the ideal path . sure , the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies  ( like people i know or the door in the floor )  , but we have never seen her again on a substantial character . the movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation ;  and it is not only that her character is not too tasty , but also that the movie is really crappy . the screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic . however , basinger brings some conviction to her character , and that makes this poor movie to win a few points . this movie is full of clichés and generic villains . the work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly , because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone . the ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous . i do not recommend while she was out at all . this film commits the capital sin of being boring . 
i really miss the production of good old fashion spooky films .  if ismail merchant and james ivory had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one ,  save for the lack of an internationally known ,  top drawer cast .  this is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn ,  and you don't even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers .  bravo to director herbert wise ,  writers susan hill and nigel kneale ,  top production design by jon bunker ,  art direction by john ralph and an excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so isolated even though i'm living in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning of the 21st century .  i gave it a  " 9 "  out of  " 10 "  because with the production and budget constraints of television ,  they really pulled of a great show . 
shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role .  elizabeth shue is a commendable actress ,  why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity ?  i must give credit where credit is due ,  though .  some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing ,  but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon's character ,  sebastian caine .  i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone ,  man or woman ,  that has any form of self-respect to account for . 
i have to admit ,  i don't remember much about the characters or the story ,  though i'm not sure there was one ,  i was soooo irritated by this movie that i had a bit of a hard time focusing on it .  how can you name a movie  " keys to tulsa "  and then film it in texas ?  the flat desert country around arlington  (  i think that was the location )  in no way resembles the green rolling hills around tulsa ,  and a celebrity in tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in .  obviously no one in the movie has ever been to tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it .  hadn't anyone at least seen rumblefish or the outsiders ?  i know this sounds picky but i can't help it .  i watched this because i love james spader and i usually find eric stotz interesting .  but even these two intriguing actors could not liven up this meandering , and mean story of self-involved people who are not in tulsa !  !  i'm sorry ,  it can't be more expensive to film in oklahoma .  what if  " to live and die in la "  had been shot in toronto ?  would that suck ?  well so does this . 
red eye starts in texas where hotel receptionist lisa reisert  ( rachel mcadams )  is about to catch the last 'red eye' flight back to miami where she lives & works .  while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome & charming jackson rippner  ( cillian murphy )  & they both seem to hit it off ,  then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other .  once the plane takes off & they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is & that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence ,  jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary charles keefe  ( jack scalia )  & they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami .  jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel & make it happen or her father will be killed .  .  .   directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left  ( 1972 )  ,  a nightmare on elm street  ( 1984 )  ,  the serpent and the rainbow  ( 1989 )  ,  the people under the stairs  ( 1991 )  & the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short ,  punchy ,  fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes .  the script by carl ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed ,  at only 85 odd minutes in length it's a very quick moving ,  economical & straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight ,  taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots .  some may like this approach like i did while other's may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick & fast without the film slowing down any & giving you a chance to relax .  i really liked the plot for red eye ,  sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell ,  it's a film made to entertain & for me that's what it did .  i really liked the two central character's ,  lisa comes across as very likable while jackson rippner  ( an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the ripper )  is a suitably slimy villain with a cold 'i'm only doing my job' type mentality .  another plus point is that i didn't think anyone behaved overly stupid here ,  everyone actually seemed like human beings & the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion .  i really liked this & it's one of craven's better more recent films .   craven turns in a good solid tense ,  tight ,  taught & fast paced thriller with an attractive cast ,  some good action & a gripping plot .  he certainly doesn't hang about & once he starts the action & tension he never lets up ,  far & away the most effective part of the film is when rippner is holding lisa hostage on the plane & once the film switches to miami & lisa's fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it's still good .  a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this ,  i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it & looks drop dead stunning .  those who see wes craven's name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since there's no horror in it at all  ( despite the imdb listing 'horror' as red eye's genre )  .  i am not sure about the ending ,  on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some way .   dreamworks apparently gave red eye an initial budget of $44 , 000 , 000 but reduced it to $25 , 000 , 000 although it's still a very well made film with glossy production values .  actually shot in los angeles & florida in california .  the film was supposedly written with husband & wife sean penn & robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads .  as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy & is a total babe in this & worth watching the film for on her own .  oh ,  & she puts in a decent performance too .   red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely ,  i didn't think i would enjoy it as much as i did & i am glad i decided to watch it .  this definitely gets a recommendation from me & rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this .  .  . 
annie's wig does not look good .  she is not cute and pretty enough to play annie .  annie sticks out in the movie ,  as her outfits look like halloween costumes .  terrible acting and terrible plots .  this movie is such a change from the 1982 version .  i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role .  ashley johnson portrays a very boyish annie .  not appealing at all .  at least the casting director got it right with daddy warbucks .  ms .  hannigan was also miscast .  camilla belle played molly alright .   " warning "  this movie might insult your iq so you might just want to only show it to very young children .  8 and younger .  some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world . 
the  " gangster "  genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody .  in retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichés that have been utilized in it's genre ,  thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it .  the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it's content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance ,  humor and unvarnished violence .  the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew  , however ,  tony is of two persona's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent .  with out any inhibitions or contradictions i still adamantly believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory .  all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series ,  but i won't .  if ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital ,  ambiguous ,  unrelenting ,  epic ,  uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you . 
chillers starts on a cold ,  dark stormy night as a bus drops off three passenger's outside a bus station ,  a young boy named mason  ( jesse emery )  ,  a college professor dr .  howard conrow  ( david wohl )  & a woman named sharon phillips  ( laurie pennington )  .  inside they discover that they have missed their connecting bus & are stranded for the night .  in the waiting area they find two other people ,  ronnie  ( jim wolf )  & a sleeping woman named lindsay  ( marjorie fitzsimmons )  who is currently having a terrifying nightmare .  .  .   while swimming in an indoor pool lindsay encounters & befriends guy named billy waters  ( jesse johnson )  ,  the next time lindsay sees billy he dives into the pool & then seemingly disappears into thin air before he surfaces .  shortly after lindsay discovers that billy water died in a diving accident 5 years ago .  .  .   lindsay wakes up & tells the others about her nightmare ,  everyone else responds by saying that they too have suffered disturbing dreams recently & decide to share them to pass the time .  .  .   next up is mason who tells a story of how he & two friends ,  scott  ( david r .  hamm )  & jimmy  ( will tuckwiller )  ,  are terrorised during a camping trip .  .  .   then it's sharon whose story revolves around a newsman named tom williams  ( thom delventhal )  who she phones up ,  in no time at all tom is at her front door but he actually turns out to be a vampire .  .  .   it's ronnie's turn next & he describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead back to life ,  unfortunately he brings executed mass murderer nelson caulder  ( bradford boll )  back to homicidal life .  .  .   finally dr .  conrow tells a tale of how two of his students brought an ancient aztec war-god named ixpe  ( kimberly harbour )  back to life .  .  .   then it's back to the bus station for one last  ( predictable )  twist .  .  .   written ,  produced & directed by daniel boyd chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies i've ever seen & i usually really like this sub-genre .  the script by boyd lacks what is needed for films such as chillers to work ,  you can see the final twist coming a mile off & each story is really lame .  the first one is totally pointless & didn't seem to have an ending & the best thing about these anthologies are the short snappy stories that are rounded off with a neat twist .  the second story is predictable & ,  again ,  just ends without any payoff .  so it continues throughout chillers that each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch & have no reward for doing so .  the character's & dialogue are poorly written ,  the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own & as a whole the film totally sucks .  at least each story doesn't last long & i liked the idea behind the linking segments .   director boyd was obviously working with a very low budget & it shows .  all i can say is if you want to watch a 15 odd minute short story set entirely within a swimming pool then chillers is for you .  the stories are neither clever ,  scary or have any sort of tension or build up to anything .  having said that it does have a few nice scenes & some surprising competence shines through on occasion .  violence & gore wise there isn't much happening in chillers ,  a ripped out heart ,  a decapitated head & a bitten off hand is as gory as it gets .   technically chillers is poor stuff that won't impress anyone .  basic cinematography ,  bad music ,  cheap special effects & below average production values .  chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever ,  period .  the acting is also of a very low standard .   i am sure a lot of effort was put into chillers as a low budget film & at least the filmmakers tried so i will give credit for that at least ,  but that still doesn't stop me from thinking it's crap .  similar anthology films like tales from the crypt  ( 1972 )  ,  asylum  ( 1972 )  ,  the vault of horror  ( 1973 )  ,  dr .  terror's house of horrors  ( 1965 )  ,  creepshow  ( 1982 )  & tales from the darkside :  the movie  ( 1990 )  are far superior to chillers so watch one of those instead . 
**************possible spoilers********** there is only one reason why i saw this movie and that was because i have a massive crush on richard belzer .  ( i don't know that much about humor )  there were some part that were funny like the barbie and ken spoof and the dealers and the president skit .  mind you this is sometimes raunchy ( dare ,  i say crude ?  )  it was at times funny ,  but it could have been better .  probably if they spent more time in the humor and less time getting women undress ,  the movie would had been funnier .  some skits just make you want to gag ,  and cringe ,  others skits make you laugh and oddly enough think .  sadly this movie is dated .  if you have a mad crush on richard belzer ( so worth it )  it's worth checking it out and seeing chevy chase . 
people call this a comedy ,  but when i just watched it ,  i laughed  only once .  i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was 14 ,   and i wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be  taken seriously .  there were quite a few scenes that were meant  to be funny ,  but i cared too much about the characters to laugh at  them .   i suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love ,   and try to take it seriously .  i think you'll find that ,  despite a few silly  flaws ,  it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen . 
this is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star ,  john curtis estes ,  better known as john holmes .  boogie nights is also roughly based on his life .  maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of tommy byron instead .   the problem is ,  that the story is not very well told .  there are many law & order episodes that have more twists and turns than wonderland ,  and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto .  val kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as hung as holmes is  ( and no prosthesis this time around ,  unlike in boogie nights )  ,  and he is much better looking than mope holmes .    the director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast .  the racist ,  immature lowlifes he hangs out with ,  or his wife ,  and the police don't get much in the way of characterization .    the best part of the movie is eric bogosian telling paris hilton to  " get lost "  .    having said all that ,  anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime shouldn't miss it . 
charles mcdougall's resume includes directing episodes on 'sex and the city' ,  'desperate housewives' ,  queer as folk' ,  'big love' ,  'the office' ,  etc .  so he comes with all the credentials to make the tv film version of meg wolitzer's novel surrender ,  dorothy a success .  and for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react afloat .   sara  ( alexa davalos )  a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friends - gay playwright adam  ( tom everett scott )  ,  adam's current squeeze shawn  ( chris pine )  ,  and married couple maddy  ( lauren german )  and peter  ( josh hopkins )  with their infant son - to a house in the hamptons for a summer vacation .  the group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by adam and sara )  results in an auto accident which kills sara .  meanwhile sara's mother natalie swedlow  ( diane keaton )  who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting 'surrender ,  dorothy' ,  is playing it up elsewhere :  when she receives the phone call that sara is dead she immediately comes to the hamptons where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among sara's friends .  slowly but surely natalie uncovers secrets about each of them ,  thriving on talking about sara as though doing so would bring her to life .  natalie's thirst for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the binding love of the departed sara that they all eventually come together .   diane keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together .  the screenplay has its moments for good lines ,  but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given .  yes ,  this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is altered by disclosures - but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching .  grady harp
i actually like asylum movies .  i've made it a habit to see as many as possible .  even the rip-offs they've done have been cool like exorcism and when a killer calls .  this is just plain lame .  i can't believe that the same people who made dead men walking and dracula's curse actually made this movie too !  !  !  it's not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction  ( which ,  by the way are pretty bad )  .  this is just bad !  i mean ,  i can appreciate and/or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie ,  but this film takes itself way too seriously .  i really hope that snakes on a train is better .  now that's a movie i can't wait to see . 
despite having 6 different directors ,  this fantasy hangs together remarkably well .   it was filmed in england  ( nowhere near morocco )  in studios and on a few beaches .  at the outbreak of war ,  everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon .   notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song -  " i want to be a bandit ,  can't you understand it "  .  it remains a favourite of many people . 
sean bean is great ,  as are the photography ,  locations and costumes .  however ,  the plot is somewhat muddled ,  and the conclusion flat .  the plot has been substantially altered from cornwell's novel ,  and not to the better .  unfortunately ,  this adventure is much better read than watched .  sharpe was too narrowly drawn here ,  in contrast with his literary alter ego ,  who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks .  i really enjoyed the brief scene in which sharpe is tripped by a  " real "  officer ,  and after a quick pause and piercing stare ,  pushes the surprised and cowed officer right back .  it sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer .   rating :   " 4 "  of  " 10 .  " 
this snarky ,  homophobic thing was dated in 1976 .  it seems particularly mean-spirited now ,  filled with gay stereotypes ,  and characters that are meant to be laughed at ,  rather than with .  redd foxx does his standard schtick ,  michael warren at least tries to bring humanity to a one dimensional character ,  and pearl--pearl what were you thinking-- ?  pearl bailey deserves far better . 
this is a really cool movie !  i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a week .  .  . shadow was my favorite character in the movie .  homeward bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things .  parts of the movie are sad though  ( such as when sassy ,  the cat ,  falls down the waterfall ,  and when shadow falls in the hole at the end .  )  i have seen the second homeward bound but i gotta say its not as good as the first .  shadow is the smart one ,  sassy is ,  well ,  sassy ,  and chance is the funny idiot .  i recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies ,  or talking animals .  this is one of my top ten favorite movies ! 
i really don't want to compare martin scorsese's cape fear to the classic 1962 cape fear film ,  but i can't help it .  not only am i a huge fan of the robert mitchum and gregory peck starred cape fear ,  but when scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film  ( cady taking the keys out of the ignition ,  dog dying )  and even using bernard herrmann's score throughout the entire film ,  he's not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as i can't help but think of the classic cape fear nearly every scene .  when comparing scorsese's version of cape fear to the classic version ,  the remake comes out destroyed by the classic ;  but even when taking the film by itself ,  it's still bad .   now scorsese and screenwriter wesley strick didn't just remake the 1962 cape fear scene for scene ,  they tried to do things differently .  unfortunately this is one of the film's problems .  gone is the original crazy and animal-like max cady who is out for personal revenge ,  the max cady in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to  " save "  sam bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side  ( his words ,  not mine )  .  also gone is the stand-up and strong sam bowden seen in the classic cape fear film ,  the sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy ,  magoo ,  distrustful ,  and very unlikable .  even mrs .  bowden is a completely different character - she's crazier than max cady is !  the overall story has also been changed around - sam didn't testify against cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version ,  sam is now cady's ex-lawyer who cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to  " save "  him .   the overall story has been changed ,  and i don't hold too much against it ,  but the overall script is also weak all around .  other sub-plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture ,  they are also just poorly written .  the film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you can't take the least bit seriously .  these aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have ,  but they have some help in this department as well .   now the classic version of cape fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety .  however ,  scorsese is unable to do any of this in his cape fear ,  giving the film a cookie-cutter early 1990s look ,  no sense of danger ,  no suspenseful scenes ,  and little style  ( unless you count animating fire and the skyline style )  .  yeah ,  there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this cape fear bigger than the original ,  but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe .   if all that wasn't enough ,  the acting isn't great either .  robert de niro  ( being somehow nominated for an academy award for his performance )  starts off alright as max cady ,  but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film .  the opposite thing happens for jessica lange and her performance of mrs .  bowden ,  going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end .  as sam bowden ,  nick nolte stays the same throughout the whole film :  beige .  juliette lewis  ( who also reeled in an academy award nomination )  is decent enough in her role as danielle bowden ,  but she's called upon to play a real stupid character and it's hard to really like what we see on screen from her .   this film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes ,  and i can't figure out why .  i wanted to like it ;  i really did - i mean ,  if there's going to be a remake of cape fear i'd rather like that one too - but i just couldn't .  containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original cape fear ,  i found martin scorsese's cape fear to be a very bad film indeed .  the best things about the film are robert mitchum and gregory peck in their supporting roles - go figure . 
i screamed my head off because seeing this movie was my first movie going experience ever at some 13 months old .  i remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry .  i watched it again on tv a few years ago .  big mistake -- the acting is wooden ,  the plot non-existent and the movie lacks merit unless 23 year-old t & a is what gets you going .  .  .  0/****
this is one really bad movie .  i've racked my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make .  the acting is atrocious .  i've seen more believable performances on cable access .  the plot is ridiculous .  stolen diamonds ,  secret recordings of the president ,  and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst .  night of the sharks isn't even so bad it's good .  the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed .  and to top it off ,  night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack i've ever heard .  i'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record .   from everything i've read ,  the italian film industry was dead by 1987 .  night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin . 
this movie pleasantly surprised me .  it has a touching ,  slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention .  this is a movie i never heard about ,  but if you want a  " sleeper "  ,  this is it .  great writing ,  production ,  and acting .  i highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful .  nick nolte ,  sheryl lee and alan arkin are marvelous .  why wasn't more made of this movie ? 
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency .  there was a bit  ( but precious little )  of good acting ,  primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg ,  who only appeared once and had no lines .  otherwise the acting was decidedly bad .  the plot line was rather weak ,  and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation .  certainly not one of the year's best . 
no strings attached is one of carlos mencia's best performances to date .  mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues .  however ,  he does more than that in this stand-up performance ,  which took place in san francisco .  in general ,  mencia's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today .   in this hour long performance ,  mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration ,  what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace ,  terrorism ,  his opinion of mel gibson's passion of the christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by jesus ,  and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped .  mencia even discusses whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke .   carlos mencia is not afraid to offend ,  which at many times gets him trouble with his critics .  for example ,  he does go somewhat far  ( and he admits it )  with a joke regarding pope john paul ii and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now .    mencia's main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend .  he reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as americans .   if you enjoy this performance ,  i definitely recommend watching mind of mencia ,  his show on comedy central . 
 " journey of hope "  tells of a poor turkish family and their odyssey of hope which spirals downward into despair as they travel to switzerland in search of prosperity .  although this oscar winning film is fairly well crafted ,  it is lacking in substance and has many implausibilities .  much of the film's 1 . 7 hour run time is get on the bus ,  get off the bus ,  get on the boat ,  get off the boat ,  get in the van ,  get out of the van ,  etc .  ;  time which could have been better spent or left out completely .  the story has a predictable conclusion ,  especially for those who have an awareness of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants .  a worthwhile and reasonably entertaining watch but over-rated . 
if the very thought of arthur askey twists your guts ,  don't worry ,  you can still watch and love the ghost train ,  like the equally marvellous back room boy ,  it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance ,  even that of the lead actor .  personally ,  i love askey ,  perhaps it's because i go into his world ,  rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine ,  which is a mistake too many people make .  the ghost train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep ,  dark world it transports you to ,  it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it's a film that i would imagine few people have ever watched just the once .  the cast are ,  without exception ,  extraordinarily good ,  perhaps linden travers lays it on a bit thick ,  but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime ,  she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out .  the sad passing of the lovely carole lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past ,  but waiting patiently for us to press play . 
i think it was an overrated pg-13 crap !  at least brittany snow's performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too ,  but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing .  the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too .  the deaths were stupid ,  boring and completely unoriginals .  the movie was very boring too and very overrated .  it wasn't suspenseful at all ,  i almost fall asleep .  its another bad pg-13 remake ,  its really a dreadful movie imo .  the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring .  the movie is pretty slow too .  overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too ,  but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake .  well thats just my opinion .  i gave it a 2/10 . 
i saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show .  i still vividly remember the film ,  especially the performance of robert taylor .  i always thought taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid ,  almost dull leading man type ,  and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks .  this film ,  however ,  proved what an interesting actor he could be .  he did not get enough roles like this during his long career .  this is his best performance .  he is totally believable in a truly villainous role .  from what i have read ,  he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles .  he basically would just do what mgm gave him .  this film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles .  the other thing i remember about this film is how annoying lloyd nolan's character was .  nolan was a great actor ,  but this character really aggravated me .  the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years .  this film is definitely worth a look . 
kept my attention from start to finish .  great performances added to this tremendous film .  mr .  pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy . 
yowsa !  if you really want some action ,  check out the babes and bombs on this non-stop thriller !  veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism .  .  .  but director dean hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy-swimsuit scenes ,  jiggly beach jogs ,  hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like !  want action ?  you'll get more of it here than in pearl harbor .  want babes ?  you'll get an eyeful every two minutes .  want more ?  go out and buy this video !  yowsa ,  yowsa ,  yowsa !  that's some mighty spicy meatballs !  !  ! 
don't get me wrong - i love david suchet as poirot .  i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re :  death on the nile .  everyone has done this one !  we know who dies .  we know why they die .  we know who the killer is .  we know how it was done .  so i say enough already !  mr .  suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie's novels .  i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb .  the sets were terrific and very realistic .  i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful' he looked .  i hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life !  i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same .  somehow i don't think so .  i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms .  christie wrote it that way .  i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison ! 
as the number of video nasties i've yet to see dwindles ,  this little pile of garbage popped up on my  " to rent "  list when i saw it was available .   the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots .  some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip ,  though if he returns with the girl and all the money ,  he gets a significant cut .  he's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and ,  wow ,  that pilot is one of the worst actors ever !  granted ,  they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood .  after stealing away into the jungle ,  we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour .  now ,  this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever ,  ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it .  his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack ,  and i found myself muting much of those scenes .   oh ,  did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity ?  this is probably the main reason this film was banned ,  though there is one specific scene ,  about one second long ,  where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out ,  but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans .  also ,  jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals ,  and ,  sadly ,  male as well .  so ,  if you want  " fair "  in terms of exploitation ,  you got it .   i can't recommend this trash to anyone .  it's not even the good bad movie .  it's just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then ,  if you are making your way through the list ,  leave this for the very last .  if you watch it first ,  you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list ,  which is certainly not true . 
where do i start ?  per the title of this film i expected some degree of authenticity ,  in the end i was severally let down .  this is not the story of lale andersen or the song lili marlene ,  rather it is a hollywood  ( or pick your film making hub )  story loosely based on some real life characters .  i should have had a clue when i heard a heavy english accent giving the intro to the movie in german ;  the blood red text  ( title ,  artists )  should have been the 2nd clue .  the story line is contrived  ( lale was not tricked out of switzerland rolf liebermann's parents ,  there is no info that liebermann helped smuggle jews from germany ,  the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the ns regime not while under control ,  the record played at the station was picked up in vienna while a lt .  was there on leave ,  etc ,  etc )  the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames  ( ss black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions ,  these went away from daily use once the war started ,  etc )  ,  the characters are stereo types  ( sa bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power )  .  don't waste your time . 
i've just returned from a showing of  " my left foot "  at our public library .  what an emotional experience -- i feel drained and uplifted .   it's the story of christy brown ,  irish writer and painter ,  and based on the author's autobiographical  " my left foot .  "  christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot .  doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother didn't give up on him and ,  somewhat as annie sullivan had done with helen keller ,  helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then to read ,  write ,  and paint .   this film won academy awards for daniel day-lewis  ( best actor )  as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother ;  it also received oscar nominations for best picture ,  best director ,  and best adapted screenplay .   as a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist ,  while many films may entertain me ,  many also often leave me having to overlook gross fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions .   not this film--it was absolutely  " spot on "  in portraying typical irish parental roles & behaviors  ( see ,  e . g .  ,  see typical irish families in mcgoldrick's  " ethnicity & family therapy "  )  as well christy brown's uneven emotional maturation--some immature personality reactions that were even further amplified by his picking up traits of his father .   the film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development  ( painting & writing )  and condensing several important people into one person ,  for the sake of telling a coherent ,  believable story ,  not burdened by small ,  distracting ,  less important actualities .   ( see christy brown in wikipedia for more accuracy .  )  the dvd version we were shown had some english subtitles that were a great help in understanding christy's speech  ( & some of the irish speech )  ;  the initial release of the film may have lacked this .   ( if you see this on dvd ,  enable that option .  )   the performance by daniel day-lewis is one of the greatest ,  believable acting jobs i've ever seen .  truly magnificent ,  outstanding ,  superlative .    " my left foot "  bears more than some similarity to a more recent film ,   " the diving bell & the butterfly ,  "  in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully surmounting the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap .   and in doing so ,  it resonates with william ernest henley's  " invictus "  which begins :   " out of the night that covers me , //black as the pit from pole to pole , //i thank whatever gods may be//for my unconquerable soul .  " 
walt disney & his 9 old men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of cinderella ,  which i guess you could say helps form an unofficial  " fairy tale princess trilogy "  from the classic disney years .   the plot :  cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break .  she is the daughter of a nice ,  wealthy widower who loved her dearly ,  but her mother passed away when cinderella was very young ,  and cindy's father felt she needed a mother figure ,  so he eventually married the woman who would become known as lady tremaine ,  herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as cinderella ,  anastasia and drizella .  at first they all seemed to get along ,  but then cinderella's father died ,  and lady tremaine's true nature was revealed - she was a cold ,  cruel ,  callous ,  heartless ,  mean spirited woman ,  and she passed those traits on to her daughters ,  who were spoiled ,  bratty ,  and equally mean spirited .  anastasia & drizella hate cinderella because they know deep down that she's better looking and an overall nicer ,  more attractive lady than themselves  ( i . e .  ,  more appealing to men )  ,  and their mother ,  lady tremaine ,  hates cindy for pretty much the same reasons .  as the years passed lady tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve/refine her awkward ,  unattractive daughters  ( to call them  " homely "  would be an insult to homely people everywhere )  while all three relegated cinderella to being the multi-tasking servant of the house ,  abusing her ,  mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get  ( they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload )  .  that brings us to cinderella in the present ,  where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor .    cinderella gets her shot at freedom & happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife ,  settle down ,  start a family ,  etc .  naturally ,  her step family tries to keep her from attending ,  even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself  ( with a little help from her mice friends - the dress belonged to her biological mother )  .  finally pushed beyond her breaking point ,  cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair .  it is at that point that her fairy godmother ,  a short ,  plump ,  jolly woman ,  arrives and provides cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress  ( after all ,  cinderella wouldn't make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped )  .  cindy arrives at the ball ,  the prince falls hard for her ,  but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way ,  forcing her to flee ,  but leaving behind a glass slipper .  make a long story short - after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper ,  cinderella is found and she and the prince get married ,  giving her the happy ending she deserves .   overall ,  an enjoyable disney classic .  not without its flaws ,  the most glaring of which is that the prince is little more than a macguffin to help push the plot along - he has very little screen time and even less dialogue ,  so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with cinderella  ( which is unfortunate since ,  according to the making of documentary ,  the prince was originally meant to play a bigger role )  ,  and a few additional scenes to help flesh out cinderella herself might have been helpful  ( there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step-family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy ,  which was cut because walt himself thought it made her look spiteful )  .  still ,  cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine ,  even if she is upstaged by her mice friends ,  and there's a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days .  of course ,  if this were being made now ,  cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax  ( either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window )  but this is beside the point .   and for all those who say cinderella sets a bad example for young girls ,  well ,  consider this - at least cinderella didn't go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed ,  unlike some modern day  " princesses "   ( you know who i mean )  . 
this is one of the best fred astaire-ginger rogers films ,  or at least one of my favorites .  most of the a-r movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories .  this still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films .   this movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs .  the music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a tap solo by rogers .  she not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure .  she dances also with fred ,  of course ,  and they're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor .   growing up in the 1950s watching  " ozzie & harriet "  on television ,  it was a real kick the first time i saw this to see such a young harriet hilliard .  no surprise than ozzie fell for this beauty .  although she had that short early '30s hairstyle ,  i recognized her voice right away .  also in this movie are quick appearances by betty grable and lucille ball ,  but i have to admit that i have yet to out ball .  i can't find her ,  but i know she's in here .   astaire ,  except for some obnoxious gum-chewing in the first third of the film ,  was fun to watch and randolph scott - although better in westerns - is likable ,  too .   this is simply a nice ,  feel-good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of astaire and rogers . 
panned by critics at the time but loved by the fans ,  this film has now become a classic .  mixing supposedly 'surreal' footage shot at john lennon's home among other places with live footage of marc bolan & t . rex at their very best ,  this film is not just a must for everyone who's liked marc bolan but gives a fascinating insight into the era .   these were the times when marc was hobnobbing with the likes of ringo starr of the beatles [who directed it] and you can even find a brief spot from one reg dwight [elton john to you] bashing the ivories in an amazing [and never officially released] version of tutti frutti and rocking and ballad versions of children of the revolution .   there's also wonderful scenes featuring chelita secunda [said to have 'created glam rock' with her use of glitter etc] ,  mickey finn and even the actor from catweazle !  !   the best scene for me is in the garden when marc leaves the dining table ,  sits down cross-legged in front of a string section and knocks out acoustic versions of classics such as get it on and the slider .   highly ,  highly recommended !  !  five stars [out of five] .   rory
dumbland is not for all .  in fact dumbland maybe in for nobody except lynch and that's what make it funny and a collective cartoon .  violent ?  yes .  profanity ?  yes .  absurd ?  yes .  a piece of garbage ?  never .  dumbland is a wonderful picture of some americans that don't have brains and hit wife and kids for fun .  from méxico i can say i love it !  my favorite episodes are :  1- my teeths are bleeding ,  all the noise around and violence make me wanna scream and put me behind my bed .  2- get the stick !  yeah baby get it and learn a lesson :  some people never be thankful for your actions .  3- ants .  the more lynch episode of all ,  music ,  surrealism and a very sweet revenge .  .  . 
warning :  possible spoilers  ( but not really - keep reading )  .  ahhh ,  there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i won't have room to list them all .  the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills ;  an enchanting peres 'prez' prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited  ( but his grunts are unmistakable ,  and no-one else did them )  ;  and with familiar cast names ,  including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 & 2 plus teri hatcher from tv's superman .   every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors ,  actresses and producers in daytime tv .  peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned ,  delicious farce .  robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine ,  but feels like a gift to us in the audience .  some of the cliched characters are a bit dim ,  but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy ,  especially against celeste talbert  ( sally field )  who is the show's perennial award-winning lead ,  nicknamed  " america's sweetheart "  .  the daytime emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to celeste's show ,  the sun also sets .  against all vain fears to the contrary ,  celeste wins again .  she is overjoyed ,  because it's always  " such a genuine thrill "  :   " adam ,  did you watch ?  i won !  well ,  nguh .  .  .  "  the reason for adam's absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot ,  and we're instantly off on a trip with celeste's neuroses .  she cries ,  screeches ,  and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee  ( kathy najimi ,  constantly waddling after celeste ,  unseen through celeste's fog of paranoia )  indulges a taste for tammy faye baker ,  for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hired .   rosie schwartz  ( whoopi goldberg )  has seen it all before .  she is the head writer of the show ,  and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years .  so when celeste freaks ,  rosie offers to write her off the show for six months :   " we'll just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama .  "  but celeste has doubts :   " i thought that the dalai lama moved to la .  "   " -well ,  then ,  some other lama ,  fernando lamas ,  come on !  "  .  such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas ,  son of aforementioned fernando lamas  ( d .  1982 )  .   those who can remember the economics teacher  ( ben stein )  in ferris bueller's day off  ( 1986 )  as he deadeningly calls the roll  (  " bueller .  bueller .  bueller "  )  ,  will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer .  other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall  ( in real life mr happy days and brother of penny )  ,  who  " gets paid $1 . 2 million to make the command decisions "  on the sun also sets - he says he definitely likes  " peppy and cheap "  ;  and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon ,  who's  " a bitch "  .   geoffrey anderson  ( kevin kline )  is the  " yummy-with-a-spoon "   ( and he is ,  by the way )  dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes  ( robert downey jr )  ,  and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier .  of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character ,  rod randall ,  was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago .  somehow they work out the logical difficulties ,  and geoffrey anderson steps off the choo-choo .   celeste can now only get worse ,  and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps .  first ,  her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara ,  but she soon degenerates into a stalker .  unfortunately ,  she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily .  geoffrey's been promised development of his one-man play about hamlet ,  and he means to hold the producer to that promise .   " i'm not going back to florida no-how !  "  ,  argues geoffrey .   " you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf  !  "  and indeed ,  seeing geoffrey's dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious .  back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room ,  geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as  " mr loman "  .  he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe ,  and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer .  now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven ,  the show's new ingenue ;  so he's not leaving .   beautiful elizabeth shue  ( as laurie )  rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well .  but ,  of course ,  the course to true love never did run smoothly .  montana moorehead  ( cathy moriarty )  is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise ,  and is getting desperate for some publicity .   will her plots finally succeed ?  will celeste settle her nerves ,  or will she kill tawnee first ?  will the producer get mr fuzzy ?  -you'll just have to watch * the second half * of this utterly lovable ,  farcically malicious riot .   and you'll really have to see to believe how the short-sighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter .  if you are not in stitches with stomach-heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face ,  feel free to demand your money back for the video rental .  soapdish  ( 1991 )  is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again ,  because it's not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines .  this is very well-crafted humor ,  almost all of it in the writing .  a draw with blazing saddles  ( 1974 )  for uproarious apoplexy value ,  although otherwise dissimilar .  watch it and weep .  a happy source for anyone's video addiction .  10 out of 10 . 
contrary to popular belief ,  this title  ,  to me at least ,  is not so very bad .  in fact .  i regard it as a favoured film of all time .  the welding of stories wasn't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series ,  however despite all this ,  you can watch it quite happily .  for a feature film of its day ,  the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable .   the sound/audio track is a personal favourite of mine .  nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their ,  now badly cast us dub ,  counterparts .  the sync is perfect in every shot .  i had a few issues with the casting for the 'alien' voices  ( please forgive the crude naming ,  it has been a while since i've seen it )  .  otherwise however ,  the cast seemed perfectly balanced .  i feel and believe in the characters of this movie .  dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago .  i loved the osd's from back then but the castings often let series down .   at this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life .  it has historical value to me ,  but even after seeing the original megazone 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection .   to my knowledge the title only ever made it to the us in texas .  personally i think its a big shame .  had the correct audience been subject to it ,  i think robotech the movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years .  i am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title .   watching the film after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows .  however ,  without seeing the originals ,  a viewer wouldn't really notice .  since the animation is identical in style ,  there was no reason to question it back in its day .  the uk had very limited access to anime .  laser discs were the most productive media .  personally i like the way carl had the balls to at least push the genre .  i mean harmony wasn't going to put up the cash for the series to get publicised .   despite the few picky faults people have had with this film ,  the eighties feel of it keeps me in love .  if you watch megazone 23 now ,  to its original japanese audio ,  or the new dub ,  i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the osd .  cast your minds back to the original bubblegum crisis dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to e . v . e .   saying all this .  this film's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its rarity on the open market .  personally ,  it spawned a collection for me .  i'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet carl macek ,  ill shake his hand for the effort ,  and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime . 
yeah ,  i remember this one !  many years since i actually watched it .  the story was entirely surreal ,  but nonetheless great !  what anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at .  it's the same with  " first kid "  ,  which follows a similar pattern .  certain movies - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense .  such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer .  of course these movies lack quality ,  lack a sophisticated storyline ,  very often lack first-class acting ,  but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that's okay .  i don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites ,  but i still thought it was funny ,  had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story .  brian bonsall is a smart actor anyway . 
from the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper .   " cq "  tells a lame ,  disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures ,  a babe ,  and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick .  i can't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making .   ( d ) 
i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival ,  and there was not a dry eye in the house .  it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is ,  but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age .   it also made me think how disgusting mtv was ,  and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way ,  they declined .  shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all .   it's a wonderful and heart warming true story .  .  . take your tissues but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be . 
despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes .  where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants ?  not on the payroll apparently .    a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes .  in a later conversation she said ,   " imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates .  worse imagine dressing the scarlet o'hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo .  maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was  " missing the hoop "  or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair ,  but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears .  .  .  . and be laughing in the aisles .  .  . excellent story and photography be damned .   so .  .  . watching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances ,  actual geisha or japanese dress ,  and that was the topic of the movie !  hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making .  they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong .  i thought  " the last samurai "  was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be .  memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time . 
i've read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained .  this movie is nothing .  it's so badly written ,  directed and acted that it barely makes an impression .  the characters speak in cliche-ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible .  while that might make this campy and fun ,  it doesn't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull .  it's as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn't allowed by studio execs to give the story some true-to-life gusto or didn't have the cojones .  this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard-issue bad lifetime tv movie . 
a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true  " miike "  film and i thought this sort of description might have been a cliché .  but ,  like all clichés ,  it is based on the truth .  all the miike trademarks are here ,  the violence ,  the black humour ,  the homosexuality ,  the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character .  shinjuku is however ,  one of miike's most perfectly formed films .  he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different ,  but not necessarily better .  i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film .    as you might expect ,  the violence is utterly visceral ,  gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face .   ( only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that .  )  the film has a fantastic pace ,  unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle .  dead or alive also deals with similar issues ,  miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here ,  the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past .    i cannot sing shinjuku's praises enough .  i do not want to give away too much .  this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano's sonatine .  the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out . 
this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre .  told completely without dialogue ,  it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish ,  lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school ,  leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open .  after a while ,  a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around ,  comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl .  the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited .  as the cat comes very near to the bowl ,  the fish jumps out .  the cat catches the fish ,  drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy ,  not knowing what has happened ,  gets back .  this was amazingly filmed with real animals ;  how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable .  i only wish this film were available now for people to see ;  i only saw it once ,  in 1959 when it was originally released ,  but it has remained unforgettable . 
i have to admit that this  " re-imagining "  of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment .  specially when taken into consideration that this is a tim burton film .  he is defenetly one of the most original and ,  might i say ,  cool directors hollywood has produced .   i am personally a great fan of his work ,  but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick ,  the planet of the apes .  i really enjoyed the original film .  when it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70's science fiction film ,  but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong .  it had indeed a clear cut message .  an obvious anti-war message .  fear of the cold war ,  where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film-makers .  those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic .  although ,  the new film ,  the  " re-making "  or whatever ,  leaves us with nothing .  no message ,  no ideals behind it .  it is just another money-minded summer blockbuster .   visually tim burton does not let you down .  the dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific .   obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film .  there has to be an exciting plot or storyline .  in this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out .  the script is very lame and it is full of gaps .  it looks like this film had been written in a big hurry .  the explanation for why the apes where there ,  and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script-writers ignorance .   it raised a lot of questions ,  which had no reasonable answers to .   for example ;  why did the apes speak english ?  ,  why were there other ape-species than chimps on the planet  ( given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash-landed on the planet )  where the hell did all of those humans come from ?  how were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years .   ( i mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man !  )   and finally ,  the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb .  it was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end ,  then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending .  the ending also raises a lot of questions ,  which i know ,  don´t have intelligent answears .  did theid learn to work the space ship ?  ,  which was power-less ,  and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand ?  ,  and ,  what did he do ,  breed with all the women ?  and lets say that that would happen ,  i higly doubt that history would stay the same ,  like washington would be built exactly like it is today !   ( i mean wouln't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial ?  )   well ,  just to say something posative about the film .  some of the cast was great .  helen bonham carter's character was interesting and well-acted ,  as for tim roth as theid .  he was very good ,  a little exaturated at some points of the film .  michael clark duncan was also fine .  i was not happy with marc whalberg .  he is not much of an actor ,  and plays here a very macho colour-less character .  very unbielevable and is nothing compared to hestons character in the original .  and the main female character had no reason or place in the film .  she was just casted for the looks .  hardly said a word throughout the entire film .   well ,  i think that in the future when people think about the planet of the apes ,  they will think about the original one .  the latest will soon be forgotten . 
channel surfing and caught this on logo .  it was one of those  " i have to watch this because it's so horribly bad "  moments ,  like roadhouse without the joy .  the writing is atrocious ;  completely inane and the acting is throw-up-in-your-mouth bad .   there's low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again .  i mean ,  the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is ,  well ,  ordinary which is no big deal ,  but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel .  i'm sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10'x10' boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame .  i guess they didn't learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training  ( see hotel room check scene )  .  .  . wow a toilet  !  !  !  yaayyyyy  !  !  !  !  i don't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine .  if it smells like .  .  . and it looks like .  .  . well ,  you know the rest .   avoid like the plague .   edit :  apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie ,  i am an  " obvious hater "  which i can only assume means i am phobic ,  which of course is not true .  i decided to do this wacky ,  crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence  ( i . e .  its refreshing to see .  .  .  )   sure ,  it may be refreshing to see but that doesn't equate into a great movie ,  just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction .  in fact ,  i applaud the effort .  frankly ,  i'd rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again . 
being a fan of andy goldsworthy's art for a while now ,  and owning some of his books ,  i had some expectations of what i would see .  what i got was something completely satisfying ,  and quite a bit more than i expected .  being an artist myself  ( i work in clay )  ,  finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative ,  and it is something andy goldsworthy has mastered .  following him over the course of a year ,  the director captures the spontaneous energy ,  skill ,  and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair .  the music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating .  if you are an artist in need of inspiration ,  or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience ,  then see this movie .  i for one am glad to know that andy is somewhere out there .  creating ,  dancing ,  wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful . 
full marks for pacino's rendering of the speech over the dead kid's coffin ;  shakespeare's mark antony would be put to shame !  !   was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues ?  they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts .  i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice-over postscript .   there is little else to talk about in this film ;  even john cusack has done better roles than this one .  interestingly ,  the film is very male oriented--the women are mere appendages . 
rea ,  sutherland ,  demunn ,  and von sydow  ( in a small role )  are all brilliant in their performances .  sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role ,  where he must portray a character whose morality is ,  at first ,  uncertain to the audience .  as is so often the case with sutherland's characters ,  we must ask  " is he a villian [in this case ,  a minor one] ,  or a hero ?  "   this is a disturbing story ,  intelligently told ,  about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old soviet union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people .  as sutherland's character wryly notes ,   " the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions "  .  the  " committee meeting "   ( between rea and sutherland's characters )  after perestroika is enforced ,  with its revelations ,  has enormous emotional impact .  you can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system .   the handful of dramatic scenes portraying victims' family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story .  this is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter ,  but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives ,  and were loved .   this is a sad ,  but very important film ,  which deserved its showcase on canada's history television . 
 ( aka :  blood castle or scream of the demon )   *spoiler*  this was a drive-in feature ,  co-billed with the velvet vampire .  a spanish-italian co-production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named yanos dalmar is seen on horseback ,  riding off with his 'man-eating' dog behind him .   the townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down .  the murders first began around the time count yanos' older brother ,  count igor dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident .   then a woman ivanna  ( erna schuer )  that igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up .  yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells .  yanos wants to bring igor's charred corpse back to life .   but of course igor is still alive  ( although horribly burned )  and stalking and killing the women in the village .  we see his char-broiled face appear at various points in the film ,  so we know he's still alive ,  making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious .   igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with yanos over ivanna ,  with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that igor stumbles on to ,  meeting yet another ,  final char-broiled end .   the retromedia dvd is taken from a vhs source and looks quite grainy and bad .  other than an even scratchier trailer ,  no other extras are included .  although it has a nice ,  creepy spanish castle and good atmospherics ,  i found it to be fairly boring and predictable ,  with no excitement or mystery ,  whatsoever .    3 out of 10 . 
this has to be the best adaptation i have seen it's my favourite and i think it stays very close to the book . what really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors . the wonderful timothy dalton is the best rochester i have seen on screen brooding and tragic , while zelah clarke is the perfect combination of strength , courage , shyness and gentleness as jane .  the story ( as i'm sure most people know ) is this , the young and plain jane eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers . she is offered the post of governess at the big mansion thornfield hall to tutor adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner mr rochester .  as the months go on he falls in love with jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her . however there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at thornfield hall and when it is it's effects are devastating . this is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as i said earlier excellent acting especially from zelah and timothy . 
christopher durang must have been taught by a memorably awful nun ,  because he just can't let go of the concept .  the play ,   " sister mary ignatius explains it all for you ,  "  was presented -- at least in hollywood -- in precisely the same tone as diane keaton's lecture scenes here .  sister mary was an exaggeration ,  a lampoon ,  a bitter satire of a serenely confident ,  doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun -- and as played by lynn redgrave ,  she was hilarious .  but the movie insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously -- while ,  as mentioned ,  maintaining the same tone in the  " explains it all "  scenes .  the two approaches clash headlong and in the last twenty minutes ,  the movie goes off the track ,  plunges into the gorge ,  and explodes .  there are no survivors .  it could have worked ,  if the tone of the scenes with the four former students ,  and their encounter with sister mary ,  been pitched the same as the sister mary scenes .  or if the sister mary scenes been presented more realistically .  this way simply doesn't work at all . 
first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots .  i really enjoyed them .  i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan ,  greg kinear is pretty lackluster .  brosnan melts into this character so well ,  that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond .  it also shows his range and depth as an actor .  it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year .  i found the characters to be well crafted .  the twist in the middle i felt was especially good .  i also liked how the characters come off realistically .  so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking-stereotypes .  .  .  i like the different approaches this movie takes .  i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall .  .  . 
the number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9 .  they don't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve .  this one dropped a second body .  that body ,  and dean ,  drop about 20 feet from sam but then they are right with sam .  flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum ,  at night ,  and we can still see everything .  it's night but light is streaming through the windows .  a ghost that died in 1960's is making cell phones calls ?  come on !  there is no way sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day he makes an appointment and the doctor talks to sam like it wasn't his first visit .  sam and dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and didn't do anything to help them .  that doesn't seem like a thing the winchester boys would do .  oh and after crawling around on a dirt filled mattress and all around a nasty asylum the girls' makeup and hair is perfect and not a smudge on her white shirt .    while the implementation of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times i was not creeped out but nervous as dean sat reading elicots' journal .  i just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it's sanctity .  elicot didn't appear .  maybe that is a fault for such an important object or place  ( like elicot's office )  should draw the spirit when a living being touches or enters .  when they separate i want to scream .  .  .  'that's how you die !  always stay together and watch each others backs ! ' but they don't listen to me  : o the elicot spirit and his special ability was a very nice touch .  it's prime-time show but i do wish the horror of elicot strapping one of his victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further .   especially because of the lighting goofs i gave this a 4 .  sudden darkness or the flickering of the whole scene's lighting as the flashlight flickers is all that more terrifying .  the lighter coming or the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking .  i understand the directors wants us to see his scene but then make a mention or obvious connection by elicot touching an electric socket and the lights coming on .  have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has lights in the one room .  blue white lights flickering as electric arcs just like elicot's finger power .    seriously ,  mcg could have done better . 
its about time that gunga din is released on dvd .  i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but ,  i never tire of it .  the lead actors worked so well together .  victor mclaglen  ( sgt mcchesney )  ,  cary grant  ( sgt cutter )  and douglas fairbanks jr  ( sgt ballentine )  are an unbeatable team .   i just cannot get over their exploits in india .  your first glimpse at the sergeants three ,  is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called treasure map .  the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town- or so they think .   they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few  " residents "  in hiding .  soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base .   later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din .  they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters .  din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured .  soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din ,  and they are too captured .   faced with being killed ,  they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them .  the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush .  in doing this ,  din is shot dead .   the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them .  at the end ,  din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army . 
normally i wouldn't feel qualified to review something i only saw a half hour of ,  but i'll make an exception for this one .   let the dialogue speak for itself !  here's some of the bad guy's lines :   " i smell .  .  . teacher !  "   " sorry ,  teacher !  you get an 'f ! ' "   bad guy and bad girl  (  right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs ,  they're getting hot and heavy )  :   him - " so how do you feel about shooting some innocent bystanders ?  "   her-  ( purrs )   " you sure know how to show a girl a good time .  .  .  "  one generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone ,  gets to sum up his life and personality in this line - " i am a chicken-twit !   ( this was the usa network version )  my old man was right !  no wonder he left us .  .  .  "  boo-hoo .    ( not actually a spoiler  )  bad guy  ( on fire )  screams  " aargh !  fire !  " 
i know that there are some purists out there who poo poo anything that is not exactly like the original ,  however sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits .  i like the new iron chef because it is similar enough to the japanese version but at the same time caters to american spirit .  i love alton brown as commentator ,  because he explains things with flair .  the iron chefs themselves are very interesting .  i know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time ,  but bobby flay is the only american iron chef to beat them .  mario batali seems to have the most fun when cooking ,  making comments and being flashy while creating .  i have watched the series and find all the players work together well .  the judges are not always the best choices ,  however .  there are a few exceptions ,  like the lawyer turned foodie ,  but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served .  i enjoy watching the chefs hustle and the challengers are surprising .  the food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen .  perhaps that is all anyone can ask ,  to want to really eat what is served .  the only thing i would really change about the series is to ask folks on the show to lighten up a little .  sometimes the mood becomes a bit too tense ,  and that isn't always fun to watch when you are expecting more amusement .  i liked the version with william shatner  ( iron chef usa )  because it was so over-the-top like the original ,  but i can tell it was a pretty expensive proposition .  i wish he had stayed with this version and been the host - between bill shatner and alton brown ,  that would have me grinning for an hour .  as long as you don't expect the original japanese version and can accept this series on its own merits ,  you may find it to be an enjoyable hour . 
weak start ,  solid middle ,  fantastic finish .  that's my impression of this film ,  anyway .  i liked simon pegg in the two films i've seen him in--- hot fuzz ,  and shaun of the dead .  his role here ,  though ,  took a completely different turn .  shows his range as an actor ,  but nonetheless i really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning .   there's a kind of humour i call  " frustration comedy .  "  its supposed  " jokes "  and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments .  much like the bean character rowan atkinmson plays .  there are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too .  i don't mean to bash them here ,  so will not .   but do be warned that if you are like me ,  and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots ,  pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film .  it does get better ,  however .   i read somewhere that this is based on a true story .  hmmm .  maybe .  the film's story stopped being annoying ,  and became kind of a triumph of the  " little guy "  in the final third .  i don't need all films to be sugar and light--- but coincidentally ,  as this film got better ,  it also started to be more and more of a happy ending .   it was also a pleasure to see an old favourite ,  jeff bridges ,  play a role so masterfully .  i liked  " iron man ,  "  but was saddened by the fact that bridges' character was a villain .  purely personal taste ,  of course ,  as his acting in that was superb .  nonetheless ,  he was a marvel here as the bigger than life man of vision ,  the publisher of sharps .  it was nice to see him in a role that i could actually enjoy .   overall then ,  i liked it !  i just wish i had come in 40 minutes late ,  and missed the beginning . 
the sitcom revolved around a girl who must learn to be responsible for her own actions .  as she had the power of magic ,  she often used it to try to help her loved ones or herself ,  frequently resulting in literal puns that are often disastrous and always humorous .   the program began with sabrina's adventures in high school in the fictional town of westbridge ,  located near boston ,  massachusetts  ( as opposed to greendale in the comics )  .  in the series' later seasons ,  sabrina graduated from high school and enrolled in college ,  then moved on to her attempts to live on her own and keep a job at the local newspaper .  breaking further from its comic roots ,  the show ended with sabrina's wedding ,  although ,  in the end ,  she abandoned the wedding and ran off with harvey .   many episodes involve sabrina getting to meet ,  through natural or supernatural means ,  popular real-life musical artists of the time ,  including coolio ,  the violent femmes ,  the backstreet boys ,  phantom planet ,  davy jones of the monkees ,  britney spears ,  avril lavigne ,  daniel bedingfield ,  hanson ,  eden's crush ,  savage garden ,  'n sync ,  and ashanti .  course of nature ,  the band of melissa joan hart's then-boyfriend  ( now husband )  mark wilkerson ,  appeared in an episode in 2002 . 
considering the original film version of 'the haunting "  is in my top ten films of all time' i approached this adaption with trepidation .  i was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh ,  all those involved should be ashamed .  the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason !  you see nothing .  robert wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's .  the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from a to b ,  sadder still is that the ingredients were there  ( actors such as liam neeson ,  catherine zeta jones )  to do something different .  this film should only watched as an example of studio butchery ! 
since siskel's death and ebert's absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of richard roeper .  roeper is not a film critic he just criticizes anything he doesn't like personally i . e .  films with country music get panned because  " i don't like country music !  "  and children's movies get a standard  " don't see it now ,  wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it for your kids !  "  roeper may well be an idiot savant ,  but in some other field .  the weekly guests 'sitting-in' for ebert fare better ,  but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat ?  all that said ,  it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching .  as for roger ebert ,  if stephen hawking can talk ,  so can you !  it's your mind and thoughts we long for .  do whatever is necessary to get that usurper off his self-declared throne . 
this had all the makings of a very good film -- good actors  ( robert loggia ,  ellen parker )  ,  a good plot  ( mysterious missile from space threatens to burn up the planet )  and lots of stock footage  ( if the air force had film of jets firing rockets ,  it was used )  .  unfortunately ,  it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible time-line .   the movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit .  at under five miles and at a speed in excess of 4 , 000 miles ,  it emits an exhaust of a million degrees ,  burning up everything on the ground ,  including glaciers ,  distant early warning  ( dew )  line bases and eskimos .   every attempt at destroying the missile fails .   the first flaws in this film appear early on .  while we don't expect much from low-budget films ,  some things can't be forgotten -- like a little research .  for instance ,  both the soviets and the us fire anti-ballistic missiles that home in on the missile with unerring accuracy .  however ,  the first successful abm tests weren't done until march of 1961 by the russians .   there is too much melodrama .  dr .  loring  ( loggia )  and his assistant joan woods  ( ellen parker )  play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin .  parker's character cries and boo-hoos at loggia's sacrifice like she was at a screen test .  loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman .  a scientist  ( phillip pine )  hams it up so much he makes william shatner look like a thespian .  a bus driver continually spits out end-of-the-world crap in scene after scene .  the only good actor is the film narrator ,  played by veteran character actor lawrence dobkins  (  " naked city "  )  .   all of this could be overlooked if it wasn't for the time-line .  after the missile's info is sent to dc ,  the pentagon brings in a group of scientists .  a general  ( larry kerr )  announces that the missile will hit new york city in 63 minutes .  after this ,  there are discussions by scientists and there is a deadly lull as word is sought from ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack from the russians and if a response is necessary .   the film shows the military being fully scrambled .  civil defense people leave work and go to their stations .  eight million people scramble to fallout shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids  ( and we get to see the whitest new york city i've ever seen ,  though watching 50's sci-fi films made it seems like this was the standard )  .  the press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes .  then ,  incredibly ,  a man at the pentagon announces that the missile will hit ottawa ,  canada in 51 minutes !  all of the aforementioned action happened in 12 minutes !  then ,  to add fuel to the fire ,  loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile .  he slowly produces a caseload of plutonium ,  loads it in a jeep and takes it from dc to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile .  along the way ,  he is knocked off the road by a wild driver ,  breaks down and then is carjacked .  he finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to arm the missile .  again ,  all this in the same 63-minute time frame .   the movie also irks the viewer by making it seem as if ottawa might be saved ,  only to show men ,  women and children get roasted .  the missile is then said to have five minutes to reach new york .  loggia is still driving to the base  ( 4 more miles to go )  .  he gets to the base and arms the missile ,  a two-minute countdown is then announced .  all within five minutes .  the boroughs of new york should have been at least scorched .   by the way ,  the missile is destroyed if you haven't guessed .  the abm warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear blast .  five seconds later ,  the blast dissipates and all is clear .  yeah ,  they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to 100 hiroshimas on the outskirts of new york city and nothing happens .   the film had all the elements necessary to be a good b film ,  but wasted them .  loggia played his character so lamely you didn't care that he sacrificed himself in the end .  you didn't care about the other characters ,  not even the smarmy scientist played by pine .  the tension that should have moved the film along just wasn't physically possible in the time-line allowed  ( it still wouldn't be today ,  not even with jack bauer )  .   this film is very difficult to find .  as far as i know ,  it hasn't been re-issued on any medium and for good reason .  i don't know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice ,  but there's a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists ,  military men and businessmen into deep shelters ,  saying they're too valuable to lose .  there isn't a single woman or minority in the bunch .  hari rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano .  it was worse than  " 27 days "  where an alien gives five earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he doesn't include any blacks or hispanics .   i saw this on a special sci-fi night on turner classic movies and i don't expect it to show up again .  if you do find a copy of this somewhere ,  you might want to put it up on amazon . com . 
**spoilers*** slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the valley of the kings in egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population ,  who are at the time revolting against british rule ,  from finding out about it .   given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by his superiors british capt .  storm ,  mark dana ,  together with a couple of british soldiers and mrs .  sylvia quentin ,  diane brewster ,  the wife of the head man at the dig robert quentin ,  george n .  neise ,  make their way to the unearthed mummy's tomb .  on the way there capt .  storm sylvia and his men run into this desert-like princess simira ,  ziva rodann .   simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life ,  she doesn't drink water or get tired ,  but also knows just what capt .  storm & co .  are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig ,  pharaoh's ra ha tet tomb ,  as possible .   at ra ha tet's burial chamber robert quentin and his crew of archeologist's together with his egyptin guide simira's brother numar ,  alvaro guillot , already opened his tomb before capt .  storm can get there to stop them .  quentin violated ra ha tet's body by having dr .  farrady ,  guy prescott ,  cut his bandages .  this action on robert's and dr .  farrady's part has numar faint dead in his tracks .  it later turns out that numar somehow was possessed by ra ha tet's spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age ,  at the rate of 500 years per hour ,  to become himself a 3 , 000 year-old mummy .   the movie has numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around ra ha tet's tomb and it's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive ,  like a vampire ,  of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with .  this blood-sucking adventure by numar ,  with him later losing his right arm ,  goes on for some time until the by now crazed quentin trying to find the entrance ,  you in fact thought that he already found it ,  to ra ha tet's tomb get's himself killed is an indoor rock slide .   we learn at the end of the movie that numar ,  to absolutely no one's surprise ,  is actually ra ha tet reincarnated into another ,  some 3 , 000 years later ,  person or life .  numar's sister the mysterious and sexy simira is not only ra ha tet's sister ,  since him and numar are really one and the same person ,  but also the egyptian cat goddess babesti !  also not that hard to figure out .   with numar/ra ha tet back in his tomb and all the deaths ,  due the the pharaoh's curse ,  now at an end capt .  storm sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late robert quentin's archaeological expedition trek their way back to cairo and modern ,  this in 1902 ,  civilization .  the survivors of pharaoh ra ha tet curse keep what they found ,  and unearthed ,  only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway . 
spoilers .   first off ,  nothing really happened in this movie ,  other than a woman bleeding inexplicably .  second ,  it wasn't scary .  third ,  it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever .  let me elaborate .  the sound was edited by either beavis or butthead  i'm not sure which ,  so let's just go with beavis .  the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter ,  forcing you to turn up the volume  ( i watched this at home )  .  then beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary/shocking images ,  forcing you to quickly lower the volume again .  this occurs many times until ,  mercifully ,  the movie ends .  i can picture beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time .  if you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep ,  this one is a big mistake .  but then it's a big mistake anyway .  here's a thought  if you're going to make a horror movie ,  at least add a gratuitous beheading ,  a 19-year-old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater ,  the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range ,  a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience ,  some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh ,  or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil  ( a la tv's lost in space )  .  these people didn't even try to scare me .  they just wanted to hurt my ears . 
a disappointing end to a season that started so well  .  .  .   exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on tv in any series ,  where as this was rather bad .   well i am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment ,  but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series .   its almost as if the corporate execs didn't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up .  they failed and rather spoilt everything .   lets hope this is not a trend for the future .   still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat bizarrely and tritely done . 
i've waited a long time to see dr tarr's torture dungeon and after i watched it ,  i was really disappointed by it .  it's not the baroque film i expected it to be .  the trailer  ( which i saw on a something weird dvd )  is much better than the entire film ,  which is remarkably forgettable .  there are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other baroque styled movies out there ,  from fellini or jodorowsky .  the characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on ,  even though we see rape ,  crucifixion ,  insanity ,  etc .   the main problem with dr tarr's torture dungeon was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon more than anything else .  it was almost like watching a book .  i just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something ,  instead we see/listen to the main characters chit-chat endlessly about dull stuff .   a missed opportunity . 
being a fan of cheesy horror movies ,  i saw this in my video shop and thought i would give it a try .  now that i've seen it i wish it upon no living soul on the planet .  i get my movie rentals for free ,  and i feel that i didn't get my moneys worth .  i've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time ,  hell i'm a fan of them ,  but this was just an insult . 
i'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars .   but they just don't understand the movie .   the story is about growing up in a difficult situation .   there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren .   and there's good reason why so many critics like this movie .   and the reason is because they understand the movie .   i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people .   i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write 10 lines .   i frankly don't have anything else to say . 
i actually didn't enjoy this movie .   i saw it at a camp ,  and we didn't rave about it ,  we laughed at it .  sure ,  some parts are touching ,  but the acting is terrible ,  the effects are terrible ,  and the whole overall movie idea is terrible  ( now ,  i know it was based on a book which i haven't read ,  but i hope that the book was better than this ,  because frankly ,  i thought that this movie was very bad and boring )  .  like i said ,  i went to it with a bunch of people from a camp ,  and we were excited to be there ,  plus i got a caffeinated drink ,  but nonetheless ,  i struggled to stay awake .  the only thing that kept me up  ( other than my fear of being embarrassed once i woke up )  was the gunshots ,  that were quite pointless as well .  i just really didn't like it . 
i enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes ,  but 20-minutes in i was liberally applying the fast-forward button .  far too many shots of stewart  ( michael zelniker )  walking from room to room ,  down hallways ,  through doors and down the street ,  and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused .  gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short  ( 20-30 minutes )  ,  and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director grieve and star zelniker  ( they co-wrote the screenplay )  .   it might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that i hadn't heard said in many other films before ,  or if the ending wasn't - disappointingly - the one i had predicted three minutes into the film  ( atypical for an independent/smaller studio film )  .  at least its heart was in the right place - it wasn't your standard formulaic hollywood manipulative nonsense . 
this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life .  this is saying quite a bit ,  considering some of the choices i've made in film rentals .   i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it .  the topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender .   the  " skits "  are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags ,  and it's such a blatant  ( and poor )  rip-off of the kentucky fried movie that you'll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of  " vince offer "   ( whoever that is )  .   unless you are a masochist ,  avoid this pile of rubbish . 
if mulder was looking for his real father here he is darren mcgavin ,  the first x files ,  pity it was only one season long the producers of this show didn't know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the follow up to the night stalker ,  the x files .  both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the x files years later darren mcgavin ,  as agent arthur dales helping our two favorite hero , s solving cases .  paying homage to the man i think so ,  well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren mcgavin if it wasn't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker . 
i can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick ,  but this is just bad .  and not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing mst3k make fun of it .  it's just nauseatingly bad like you can't find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try .  i truly regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this crap .  you can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers .  apparently  " walking tall "  has garnered enough income that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment .  if it's not the worst film i've seen ,  it's so bad that it's blotted the worse films from my memory . 
violence whether real or not always has an impact .  in this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for .  in the great ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of .  but what was the point ?  the violence looks like a mix of noë's 'irreversible ,  and ' kubrick's 'clockwork orange' .  .  . both of which are remarkable films .  don't get me wrong ,  i'm not opposed to screen violence at all and i've seen some nasty stuff in my film-going years ,  but this film as a whole is totally juvenile .  the story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence ,  the rizla paper thin reason we are give for robert's demise is his introduction to drugs .  danny dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for robert's drug fuelled demise ,  however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes .  lesley manville is robert's unable to cope mum ,  i am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber .  the acting is wooden ,  the scene in the kitchen with the tv-cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale- who wrote those dialogues ?  !  some of the comments the boys make .  .  . 'looks like she's enjoying it' are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for clay's ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals .  why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director's adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery .  .  . one can only wonder at this young man's psychology .   the 'political meaning' of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes ;  in the bar ,  outside the tv-cook's house ,  war in iraq reports ,  was perhaps too obvious in my opinion .  yes ,  war is violent ,  social determinism causes frustration ,  we're all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you're in politics or on the street popping e .  juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man .  this issue is one that we still haven't managed to grasp and certainly not in this film .   my opinion :  derivative ,  badly-made and pointless . 
what an incredible fall for sean ellis .   you gather a bunch of your friends at home ,  all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis .  you have an vague idea of the plot ,  no spoilers that could kill the fun ,  very high expectations .   it is late at night ,  perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type .   15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up ,  at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches .  over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day .   a few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this ,  in the middle of the day this time ,  hoping your mood will keep you awake this time .  10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images .  any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy .  but that legacy can only carry you so long ,  this is a new level of boring movie-making ,  imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions ,  this is what it is .   decent cast is wasted ,  there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either .  there are films that annoy you ,  there are films that lack certain aspects ,  or just cheesy ,  unfortunately this is just a waste of time .   final words ,  stay away . 
i like a lot of the actors/actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns  . the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers  . in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's  .  i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music  . the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana  ,  n . w . a  ,  public enemy  ,  soundgarden etc  . the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it  . see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time  . next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
like a latter day ayn rand ,  bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough american hombres stuck in iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless ,  relentless ,  child-killing arab terrorists .  as bigelow posits the iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama ,  one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty ,  hot ,  ugly rubble that is iraq ,  and a new hero is born .   the new guy is what john hershey described in his book ,  and later the movie ,  the war lover ,  as a sadistic wingnut who actually isn't fit for civilian life ,  and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires .  the war lover can only fully function in war ,  peacetime suffocates him .  while hershey chastised the war lover ,   ( played in the film by steve mcqueen in one of his greatest roles )  bigelow glorifies him .  the army needs war lovers ,  they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies .  we can't handle the truth ,  that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers ,  the toughest men .  according to the unironic bigelow ,  regular men are pussies ,  the war lover is a special breed ,  the last of the cowboys .  so what if he wants to bare-back his men ,  or fondle an iraqi boy ?  he is a throwback to the sex-and-death cult of war .  in war ,  sex is a thankless ,  loveless ,  don't-ask ,  don't-tell kind of male bonding .  bigelow has no opinion on this ;  she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham-fisted attempt at realism .  only a war-lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong ,  between american innocence and arab perfidy .  bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism .  she's just another gung-ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit .   on the political front ,  bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichés again and again ,  ad nauseam :  the wonderful world of the open frontier ,  which happens to be some one else's country .   (  " you can shoot people here "  says a soldier  )  ;  the tough but human black guy companion ,  the soldier with a premonition of death ,  the gruff ,  possibly crazy commanding officer ,  the college-educated fool who tries to befriend the enemy .  you name it ,  bigelow resurrects it .   the man-boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute arab boy who befriends the war lover ,  but bigelow plays it straight ;  she doesn't consummate the sex ,  just sanitizes it .  what bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly ,  sneering face of the arab enemy .  any iraqi who isn't pure evil is either demented ,  hostile or up to no good ,  anyway .  they all deserve to die for their impudence ,  and many of them do in this glib gore-fest film .  the iraqi women are all hysterical ,  they only make their presence known by screaming .  they could be male stunt men in drag for all i know ,  you never see their faces .  there is no female presence at all on base or in battle ,  although female casualty rates in iraq would certainly disprove this .   bigelow goes through all the motions one by one .  she glorifies war ,  she canonizes the sadist nut-case hero .  the cowboys ,  surrounded by the subhuman indians ,  prove their mettle by doing god's work and subduing the wretched terrorist-infested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania .  toward the end ,  i felt like rooting for the indians .  in bigelow's world ,  though ,  no mercy or understanding ever makes it through .  the iraqis are dehumanized par excellence .  the slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero's psycho sexual struggle .  every u . s ,  bullet finds its mark .  you have to love the guy ,  the war lover .  it's just his way ,  he is the true hero .  he's just a guy trying to get things done the hard way ,  and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side . 
vampires vs .  zombies starts with the breaking news that the unidentified disease that is spreading across america leaves the sufferer with homicidal & cannibalistic tendencies .  .  .  travis fontaine  ( c . s .  munro )  & his teenage daughter jenna  ( bonny giroux )  listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try & escape the disease when travis runs over a guy who i assume is meant to be a zombie .  slightly further down the road he stops to help julia  ( brinke stevens )  & her teenage daughter carmilla  ( maratama carlson )  who are waving at the side of the road ,  at this point there is also a third teenage girl named tessa  ( melanie crystal )  sitting in the back of julia's car bound & gagged .  to me this situation would seem strange but travis ,  like the trooper he is ,  takes it all in his stride & agrees to 'take' carmilla off julia's hands & ,  well i don't know actually .  so ,  with a complete stranger ,  travis drives off leaving julia & tessa .  carmilla seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a vampire & she likes to bite people & turn them into vampires ,  oh & she's partial to a bit of lesbianism too .  travis ,  carmilla & jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself the general  ( peter ruginis )  who appears to be some sort of vampire killer & probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it doesn't really matter & i really don't know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it .  .  .   co-edited ,  co-executive produced ,  written & directed by the supremely untalented vince d'amato vampires vs .  zombies is one of the worst horror films ever & therefore one of the worst films ever period .  the script by d'amato was apparently based on a classic story entitled 'carmilla' by sheridan le fanu  ( he should sue )  & is an absolute mess ,  the holes in the plot & logic are so big you could drive a tank through them !  what is the disease that turns people into zombies ?  why is carmilla a vampire ?  who is julia to her ?  who the hell is the general ?  what does he want ?  where are travis & jenna going ?  how can travis run a man over & yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it ?  what's with the mental ward at the end ?  there are also some confusing & unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more .  there are just so many things wrong with this film ,  the narrative doesn't make a blind bit of sense ,  the concept is terrible & never really explained properly plus it's incredibly boring .  i have not one positive thing to say about vampire vs .  zombies ,  not one .  forget about any vampires fighting zombies because it just doesn't happen ,  tell me again why is this film called vampires vs .  zombies ?   director d'amato has served up one of the most incompetent ,  rubbishy ,  badly made ,  poorly thought out & excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made .  vampires vs .  zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all ,  there is not one single aspect that i can praise .  the gore is really fake looking ,  there are some blood splats which look like red water ,  some really cheap staking effects & a half decent climax where the zombies feast on carmilla's & jenna's intestines ,  this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes & in no way makes up for the other turgid 85 .   the budget on vampires vs .  zombies must have been small ,  in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars .  this is one of the most badly made horror films it's been my misfortune to watch ,  the entire thing just sucks .  the acting is predictably awful ,  & i mean awful .   there isn't much else left to say ,  vampires vs .  zombies is easily one of the worst films ever made .  the  ( v )  next to the title on the imdb's main page for vampires vs .  zoimbies indicates that it went straight to video ,  well that's far too good for this pile of crap as it deserves to go straight on the nearest fire . 
pere is an idiot ,  but he is aware about it and acts in consequence .  his life is totally boring and he doesn't know how to change it .  when his last friend ,  nicco ,  dies .  he feels totally empty and he decides to go out to become drunk .  when he is returning home ,  he crashes with a girl that puts advertisements .  although she ignores him ,  he fells in love and starts to follow her ,  obsessively .  well the beginning of the film is a bit slow ,  and can result boring for most people .  however ,  as action begins ,  it is a little better  ( not much !  ,  maybe ,  the best part is the 5 minutes of sex  ( almost 30 different scenes about it )  that you can see in the middle of the movie ;  it is not good for the erothism ,  but for the funny and unexpected that is the scene .  probably it is the best of the film .  neither the actors nor the directing is good ,  and the results is a boring film that that can result funny for some people  ( not for me )  .  all the film is based on absurd situations  ( idiot ,  as the film says )  ,  that have anything interesting .  i like ventura pons ,  but i have to admit that this is not one of his best films  ( maybe his worst !  )  ,  he knows to do it better . 
the angry red planet  ( quickie review )    like  " the man from planet x ,  "  this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing .  meaning ,  we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction .  and yes ,  it's another  " classic "  released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound--by midnite movies .   so ,  the main reason to watch this film ?  oh ,  it's definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars .   ( what ,  you thought  " angry red planet "  referred to neptune ?  )  prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship ,  inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the  " puny female "  member of the crew .  it'd be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it weren't so damn funny .  but mars is the real reason we're watching this thing .  the film is generally black and white ,  but mars ,  well mars is screaming bloody red .  it's filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness .  it's really quite a sightas are the  ( ha ha )  aliens viewers are to witness .  the best being the  " ratbatspidercrab .  "  you think that's a joke ?  that's what they call it in the movie !  it's a gigantic chimera  ( small puppet )  of a thing combining traits of rats ,  bats ,  spiders ,  and crabs .  it bounds along all puppety and scares the sh*t out of our  " heroic crew .  "  there are other weird ,  and poorly imagined ,  aliens to be seen ,  but that one takes the cake .  eventually ,  after their harrowing experience on mars ,  the sexist crew boards their  " ship "  and returns to whatever planet it was they came from .   this ain't for everyone .  science fiction film buffs & curiosity seekers ,  and some general film buffs .  fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one  ( if they never got to it on the show )  .   2/10 modern score ,  6/10 nostalgia score ,  4/10 overall .

this film is like marmite .  you either love it or you hate it .  if you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values ,  a good plot and great characters you'll hate it .  if you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you'll probably hate it .   if you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of harry russo you will love it .  john giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane ,  murderous coke fiend .   the special effects are abysmal at best but really ,  who cares ?  if you're the kind of person who's prepared to watch a film schizophreniac :  the whore mangler you've undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore .  with the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would've mediocre at best .  i'd much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre .   to sum it up ,  you'll probably hate this film but if you're one of the few who decide to see it anyway it'll become the best thing since sliced bread #2 i hate marmite . 
on the night of his bachelor party ,  paul coleman  ( jason lee )  meets the gorgeous dancer becky  ( julia stiles )  in the bar ,  they drink a lot together and in the next morning ,  he wakes up with her on the bed .  his future mother-in-law calls him and informs that his fiancée karen  ( selma blair )  might be arriving in his apartment ,  and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry .  sooner ,  he finds that her has crabs ,  and later ,  in the preparation of his wedding dinner party ,  he realizes that becky is the cousin of karen .  this is the beginning of a very funny comedy ,  with hilarious situations .  the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor .  julia stiles and selma blair ,  who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous ,  and jason lee ,  who is amazingly funny ,  have good performances .  i laughed a lot along the story ,  but there are some scenes that are really hilarious .  for example ,  when paul finds becky in his bed ;  when he finds her paints ;  his imagination in many situations ;  in the drugstore ,  trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine ;  most of the scenes of his neighbor ,  the minister ;  when karen calls the department store ;  or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul .  i could number many other scenes ,  but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :  " louco por elas "   (  " crazy for them "  ) 
when i heard about this movie it was supposed to be the funniest thing i've ever seen ,  yes it was funny .  i mean i liked it all until the end where .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . oh no i can't tell u should it for yourself .  it is funny except .  the vulgar language .  that's why i say if u like movies that r funny in sexual ways watch it  ,  but if not don't waist ur money on renting it or buying it . 
paul naschy made a great number of horror films .  in terms of quality ,  they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash ;  and unfortunately ,  horror rises from the tomb is closer to the latter .  the plot is just your average story of a witch ,  wizard or  ( as is the case here )  warlock ,  who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it .  .  . etc etc .  we then get a séance and one thing leads to another ,  and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again .  the plot is slow ,  painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless .  the characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever .  paul naschy wrote the script ,  and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme ,  and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is .  carlos aured ,  who also directed naschy in blue eyes of the broken doll and curse of the devil provides dull direction here ,  which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film .  sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them ;  but horror rises from the tomb doesn't even have that .  this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest . 
one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo . initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it . to be perfectly honest i wasn't disappointed . the main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well . you would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film ! my only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnik . christ its bad ! the prison guard hank is woeful too . all he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co-guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end .  the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions .  this movie is well watching alone for the beautiful , talented and very sexy jennifer thomas
oh ,  brother .  the only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total  " bomb "  from me is because it's at least historically noteworthy as the first three stooges film  ( when they weren't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny ted healy )  .  but even as a longtime stooges fan i'd have to say that young moe ,  larry and curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to mr .  healy's taller boss janitor .  they're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing .   most of this toothache deals with jack pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates baron munchausen  ( here's a good example of the level of humor :   " i object !  "   " on what grounds ?  "   " coffee grounds !  "  )  .  his sidekick is none other than a young jimmy durante ,  but even the schnoz himself is a bore . 
no need to detail what others have written in other reviews - here goes the summary :    * much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous - the colors are superb - would love to have it done in silk as a necktie  * the story and execution is a total snooze - it was quite difficult to stay awake at times  if you are a student of the fine arts ,  medieval calligraphy ,  early religion and so forth - have at it .  this is a film for you .   if you want an engaging ,  entertaining movie - look elsewhere - this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement .   vikings didn't have horns by the way .  .  . 
by now you've probably heard a bit about the new disney dub of miyazaki's classic film ,  laputa :  castle in the sky .  during late summer of 1998 ,  disney released  " kiki's delivery service "  on video which included a preview of the laputa dub saying it was due out in  " 1999 "  .  it's obviously way past that year now ,  but the dub has been finally completed .  and it's not  " laputa :  castle in the sky "  ,  just  " castle in the sky "  for the dub ,  since laputa is not such a nice word in spanish  ( even though they use the word laputa many times throughout the dub )  .  you've also probably heard that world renowned composer ,  joe hisaishi ,  who scored the movie originally ,  went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements .  laputa came out before my neighbor totoro and after nausicaa of the valley of the wind ,  which began studio ghibli and it's long string of hits .  and in my opinion ,  i think it's one of miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem .  laputa :  castle in the sky is a film for all ages and i urge everyone to see it .   for those unfamiliar with castle in the sky's story ,  it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours .  the storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted ,  you see miyazaki's true vision .  and believe me ,  it's one fantastic one .  the film begins with sheeta ,  a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship .  sheeta holds the key to laputa ,  the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization .  the key to laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many ,  namely the government ,  the military and the air pirate group ,  the dola gang  ( who sheeta and pazu later befriend )  .  soon ,  the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid .  she falls a few thousand feet ,  but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant .  as she floats down from the sky ,  pazu ,  an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines ,  sees sheeta and catches her .  the two become fast friends ,  but thanks to her pendant ,  the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the dola gang and government try to capture sheeta .  one action sequence after another ,  we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue .  plus somewhat twisty surprise .  i think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time .  the story is wonderful ,  as we peak into hayao miyazaki's animation which has no limits .  the setting of the film is a combo of many time periods .  it does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s ,  but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons .  laputa is also surprisingly a funny film .  the film has tons of hilarious moments ,  almost equal to the drama and action the film holds .  i think the funniest part is a fight scene where pazu's boss faces off against a pirate ,  and soon after a riot breaks out .  it's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly .   now let's talk about how the dub rates .  an excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life .  teen heartthrob james van der beek plays the hero pazu ,  who has a much more mature voice then in the japanese version ,  where in the original he sounded more childlike .  either way ,  i think his voice is a nice fit with pazu .  anna paquin ,  the young oscar winner from  " the piano "  ,  plays sheeta .  this is also a nice performance ,  but the voice is a bit uneven ,  she doesn't stay true to one accent .  at times she sounds as american as apple pie ,  but at other times she sounds like someone from new zealand .  the performance i most enjoyed however was of coris leachman ,  who played mama dola .  not only is this an excellent performance ,  but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life .  if there was ever a live action laputa movie  ( g-d forbid )  ,  she would be the one to play her ,  you can just imagine her in the role  ( well ,  somewhat )  .  luke skywalker himself ,  mark hamill is muska ,  and this is another top rate hamill performance .  you may be familiar with hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original star wars movies ,  but he renders muska to full evil .  his voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the joker ,  who he played for many episodes on the animated batman series .  rounding out the cast is voice character actor jim cummings ,  who does a great ,  gruff job as the general and andy dick and mandy patakin as members of the dola gang .   now let me talk about what really makes this dub special ,  joe hisaishi's newly arranged music !  for those who have never heard of him ,  mr .  hisaishi does the music and like all of miyazaki's films ,  the music is very memorable .  each of his scores has it's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly .  now ,  these new arrangements he has done are more  " american like "  ,  which i think was the goal of the new recordings .  don't worry ,  the classic tunes of the japanese version are still here in great form .  the score ,  to me ,  sounds to be arranged like this is a hollywood blockbuster .  it has more power ,  it has more emphasis ,  it's clearer and deeper .  the film's prologue ,  the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships ,  has some new music  ( i am not sure ,  but i believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all )  .  but a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy .  things seem very enhanced .  in a powerful scene ,  the music is more stronger then in the original versions .  in a calm scene ,  it's more calmer .  overall ,  i think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes ,  i highly did myself ,  and personally think it helps improve the film .  i prefer the new score over the old one ,  and i hope disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack .   another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful ,  and much of the original japanese lines are intact .  in kiki ,  i'm sure a few lines where changed ,  and this is the same way ,  lines have been changed .  but a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue miyazaki has written .  i was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered ,  but they were there intact .  some new lines have been added as well which help out .  but i am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing ,  disney did not translate the ending song ,  it was in japanese .  i was mortified when they did completely new songs for the kiki dub ,  but with this version it's the original song .  .  .  in japanese .  so i guess it's good it's still the original ,  but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak english .   there is a big down side to this dub ,  and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips .  of course in any dub it won't be perfect ,  but i think in kiki and mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed  ( and disney had a little bit more time with this one .  .  .  )  .  some of the time everything matches perfect ,  some of the time it doesn't completley match ,  and in a rare case ,  someone says something and the lips don't move at all  ( there's a scene where sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit )  .   as far as things about the film itself ,  these are my thoughts .  i thought the most amazing part of laputa was the animation .  from the opening sequence to the ending ,  the animation is so lush and detailed ,  you just have to watch in awe .  you see the true nature of each character ,  true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action .  you have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film .  everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn ,  it's like a moving piece of art .  and to think ,  this was done in the mid 1980's .  the animation is quite different from disney ,  ghibli has it's own distinctive flare which is very different ,  but very good .  and after all these years ,  the colors look as vibrant as ever .  laputa also has tons of action sequences ,  lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground .  these sequences are so well done and so intriguing ,  it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film .  and the finale is just something you must see .  the sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions ,  guns firing and everything else well .  and like all miyazaki films ,  each one focuses on a different theme  ( i . g .  kiki :  confidence )  .  this one has a great a lesson on greed and power .  people don't realize how greed can take over you ,  and how having too much power isn't good .  people are obsessed with power ,  and are greedy ,  and the main villian ,  muska ,  greatly shows this .   all in all ,  laputa :  castle in the sky was a great film to begin with ,  and is now improved for the most part .  i am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory .  with a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from joe hisaishi ,  disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy .  though i think the voices matched the mouths better in the kiki and princess mononoke disney dubs ,  castle in the sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film . 
this film resembles in many ways `enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman ,  as we have an innocent  ( black )  man being pursued by the `government' with all the modern technology known to man .  usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster .  that does not apply here .  of course i love everything david morse does ,  so maybe my comments are not fair ,  but there were more good things about this film then that .  the main baddy ,  played by doug hutchison ,  was brilliant ,  and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli .  our hero ,  alvin sanders  ( played by jamie foxx )  ,  was however irritating most of the part .  he is so out of place ,  cracking bad jokes ,  evoking no sympathy from the audience .  or not to begin with ,  the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you  ( and on his followers as well !  )  .  i didn't expect much when i rented it ,  but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits .  7/10
i saw it at cinema mk2 hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris .  a very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers ,  all of them just at about the same psychologically stages .  many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age & our first feelings about sexual relations .  it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism ,  but even in that case she doesn't corrupt the likelihood of the story .  you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere .  i fund the young actresses of talent ,  special mention with floriane and marie ,  very convincing .  there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is :  impressing ! 
about a year ago i finally gave up on american television .  i thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in england showed me some programs that included the office ,  extras ,  blackadder ,  and the league of gentlemen .  it was then that i decided to switch to british television .  among all the shows listed above ,  the league of gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all ,  providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy i've seen yet .  characters included are the most unhappily married couple ,  a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid  ( probably for the best )  ,  a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people ,  and the worst veterinarian ever .  this program is one of the best i've seen . 
i was impressed that i could take my 5 year old son to this movie without having to cover his ears or eyes .  no sex scenes ,  no profanity ,  and not even any violence .  just good entertainment ,  enjoyable from beginning to end .  dennis quaid pulls off this movie very well . 
d . w .  griffith could have made any film he wanted to after the enormous financial success of 'the birth of a nation' ;  he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date ,  'intolerance . ' he took a risk with such innovations in film montage and form ,  and the well-known financial train wreck resulted .  buster keaton doesn't take that kind of a risk with 'three ages , ' a parody of 'intolerance . ' this is keaton's first feature-length film of his own  ( he only acted in 'the saphead' )  .  he had the fallback plan of dividing the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts ,  which griffith did do with 'intolerance . ' keaton didn't have to .  chaplin had already succeeded with feature-length comedies ,  so if keaton was taking a risk here ,  it was completely calculated .   chaplin had already done a parody of another film ,  too ,  with 'burlesque on carmen'  ( 1915 )  .  keaton appears to allude to that film ,  as well .  the wrestling scene in the ancient rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in chaplin's film .  the comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same ,  too .  furthermore ,  chaplin's film imitated the glossy style of demille's 'carmen , ' and chaplin's film seemed a tribute to that film .  keaton doesn't attempt the radical editing ,  narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody ,  but it seems respectful of 'intolerance' nonetheless .  at least ,  the stories aren't told completely straightforward as in other post-'intolerance' films ,  such as dreyer's 'leaves from satan's book'  ( blade af satans bog ,  1921 )  and fritz lang's 'destiny'  ( der müde tod ,  1921 )  .  there is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes .   where keaton did take risks ,  however ,  is in his physical ,  daredevil comedy .  that's keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode .  reportedly ,  he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again .  and ,  it wasn't just keaton who took risks ;  the anachronistic baseball gag ,  for example ,  was rather dangerous .  thus ,  although in a different way ,  keaton ,  like griffith ,  took risks with his big film .  and ,  i think they both succeeded . 
this has to be one of the worst movies of all time .  the graphics were horrendous ,  the acting was b-movie and the effects were just plain nintendo 64 qualified .  you would think that they would put a little more effort into it .  of course ,  it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate ,  but this one takes the cake .  hell ,  i'm still laughing .  so ,  as a shake-your-head in disbelief movie ,  this one does well .    although it appears to have some 'known' actors and actresses in this ,  it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort .    the graphics might have been good in the '60's or even early '70's but come on ,  this is 2009 !  i wont give spoilers out ,  let's just say that if you have played  " jurassic park "  on the nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film  it is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever ?  answer :  yes ,  and this is one of them .  after helming the appalling 'house of the dead' director uwe boll has now cast his less-than-talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation .  don't these guys get it ?  to anyone who can't understand ,  here it is in block capitals for you :  video games do not make for good movies !  the acting here is ,  at best ,  sub-standard .  the set design and special effects are poor .  unlike the video game  ( which did have its scary moments )  the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom ,  no sense of danger or menace .  pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper .  the main culprit is the director .  uwe boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush .  hackneyed zooms ,  swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored .  why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets .  avoid at all costs . 
the movie's premise is spooky :  a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar .   but as soon as the movie begins ,  a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a c type sci-fi tv movie .  it's a big star trek and a bit x-files ,  but more than anything else it's boring .   when the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche .  it looked more like a 2 parter in a bad sci-fi tv series .  no suspense and no thrills ,  but not for a lack of trying .  just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters .   don't waste your time . 
i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts .  the true test is whether it is good from start to finish ,  which is the reason i gave the analogical title for this review .  most of us would agree--even those like me ,  who enjoy reading many blogs--that blogs can't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons .  likewise ,  fem can't compare with good film making for a number of reasons ,  and i actually believe it's a poor example of independent filmography .  from start to finish ,  fem feels like a pieced together vlog .   ( heck ,  even myspace gets some pimping .  )  if i wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15--i don't--i'd go watch it .  fem ,  while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media ,  is so personal that it is without an interesting story .  it's like watching the mundaneness of life ,  which i think most would agree is very naturally boring .  and yet the creators of fem want us to applaud it ,  their very postmodern film about making a film .  cue my yawn .   ultimately ,  i come away not caring the least bit about any of it .  i'm shocked that i'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review ,  even .  it's not that fem is downright bad ,  because it isn't ;  it has a few moments where i crack a smile or think that maybe--just maybe--something of interest is about to happen .  it's rather that it's just downright .  .  . mediocre .  i feel so indifferent about it that it's almost fitting of an oxymoron :  passionate indifference .   i hope the creators/ " actors "  in the film get out of debt from their efforts .  they'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life .   see this movie if you've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do ;  otherwise ,  pass it by ,  and don't worry that you've missed some great ,  undiscovered talent .  you really haven't . 
i saw this movie at the 18th haifa film festival ,  and it is one of the best i've seen this year .  seeing it on a big screen  ( and i mean big ,  not one of those tv screens most cinemas have )  with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience ,  as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story ,  into the picture .   the movie presents a set of characters ,  which are loosely inter-connected .  their stories cross at certain points ,  and the multiplicity of story lines reminded me very much of the great robert altman and his exquisite films .  but the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of madrid ,  which provides the backdrop for the entire movie .  it houses the characters ,  contains the pavements and roads on which they walk ,  and sets the background atmosphere for all the events ,  all in beautifully filmed scenes .   the movie returns again and again to certain themes  ( shoes ,  for instance )  ,  and in essence salazar makes his metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses .  he combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters ,  and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background .  a set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters .  one excellent example is the scene in which juaquin takes anita across the street for the first time .  it might not work on a small screen ,  but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen .   the message of the movie is very positive ,  and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times .  the music along the movie is usually pop ,  with a few instrumental pieces  ( i hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day ,  although i seriously doubt i will )  .   all together ,  i came out of this movie with a sensational feeling ,  and i'm not easily impressed  ( you'll have to take my word for it )  .  for this and more i give this movie a solid 8/10 . 
when a friend gave me a boxed set of  " 12 amazing scifi/horror movies !  "  i was understandably a little cautious .  but ,  since the item was a gift ,  i really didn't truly pay my common sense much heed .  after all .  .  .  . movies for free !  so what if they are a little ropey .  after much consideration ,  alien intruder was the first of those movies .  ironically ,  it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch .  all i can say is ,  if this is the best of them ,  i shudder to think what the rest are like .   on the surface ,  it had some good things going for it .  four  ( count 'em !  )  actors that i was familiar with .  billy dee williams ,  tracy scoggins ,  maxwell caulfield and jeff conaway .  i told myself .  .  .  " billy and tracy have been in some good scifi  ( star wars and babylon 5 ,  respectively )  so they wouldn't sign up for a turkey .  max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film .  .  .  . but not too shoddy an actor .  an jeff .  .  .  . well .  .  . he's done the good and the bad as far as films and tv go .  "  i was soon to discover that jeff had decided to add  " the ugly "  to his repertoire of movies .   the first clue was in the opening scenes .  jeff mugs his way with gusto through an  " i'm mad "  scene before finally killing himself .  an amusing cameo performance ,  really .  unfortunately this is ,  without much exaggeration ,  the highlight of the film .  it goes downhill from there .   next up we have the commander of the mission  ( williams )  who is being sent out to see what happened to jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element .  but this assortment aren't so much the dirty dozen - more like the unconvincing foursome .  plus ,  one of the crims ,  a computer hacker ,  is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer .  isn't that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer ?  pretty lame prison ,  if you ask me .   when they finally take off the effects are truly horrible .  it looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his airfix kits .   but the horror doesn't stop there .  whilst on route to the area where jeff's ship vanished ,  the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality ,  in which they indulge their male fantasies .  all well and good ,  and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the  " alien menace "  which begins to appear there .  but did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong ?  alien intruder ?  alien boring ,  more like .   finally they make it to g-sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old max is left .  the ending ,  in truly optimistic rubbish film vein ,  hints at a sequel - as if !  also making an appearance in this movie is a character i'll nickname the  " sweatdroid "  .  he's supposed to be an android ,  but apparently that fact was lost on the make-up crew ,  who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity .  but don't worry ,  he's just there to make up the body count numbers at the end .   williams and scoggins ,  to be truthful ,  do very little in the film .  they only just barely stay awake ,  let alone act .  and ,  as i mentioned earlier ,  jeff gets an early trip to the showers ,  so his manicness isn't allowed to enlighten much of the film .  max tries his best ,  as do a couple of the other cast members ,  but the movie is just direly atrocious ,  to be honest .   the one ,  and only ,  half-way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention .  they are all named after musicians - holly ,  presley ,  joplin .  the rest of the film is bland and uninspired .   made in 1992 ,  i had thought ,  on initial viewing ,  it was one of those 80's straight-to-video jobs .  looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90's ,  it seems .   it's best avoided .  even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker ,  but at least you can fast forward it ,  i suppose . 
ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery .  what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom .  the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician .  this was a production that cried out for some t & a & with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things .  however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances & to a extent salvages her reputation .  the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play & t & a .  nough said . 
i agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted ,  that being the guy that played gary gillmore and giovanni's role .  too bad the story was so boring .  not hearing about the story i knew nothing of gary gillmore before the movie so i didn't know what to expect .  i thought it would be something like dead man walking or the chamber but how wrong i was .  the whole movie was just talking ,  talking and talking about their mom and dad .  the only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper .  that was the only interest i got from this borefest . 
there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn't one of them !  it's a shame the child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes .  we have the idea of a vengeful child ,  which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme ,  which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie .  the plot is basically this :  young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother ,  so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge  ( as you do )  .  this is all well and good ,  except for the fact that it's boring !  nothing happens for most of the film ,  and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore ;  it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it .  the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish .  there's really not much i can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it .  the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly don't recommend it . 
when i was in school i made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking ,  and i realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a cliché of canadian cinema :  sodden lyricism married to vacant ,  metaphor-burdened stabs at social commentary .  but whatever my own film's failings i feel much better after seeing this .  .  . this .  .  . thing .  for one thing ,  mine ran 20 minutes ,  not 85 ,  and had more content at that :  every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four ,  five ,  six relentless minutes .  the male lead is just incredible ,  a brow-beating ,  loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama-class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the u of t pub ,  and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him .  admittedly if he weren't such an a**hole then the third act would make even less sense ,  as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of 'exploitation' values ;  but it doesn't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper  " please "  in closeup until the magazine runs out .  i take back what i said about autumn born ,  which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery :  this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time .  at least ,  i really really hope so . 
i don't hand out ten star ratings easily .  a movie really has to impress me ,  and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that .  furthermore ,  this trilogy has come together so nicely ,  that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time .  though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels ,  they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement .  the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete ,  yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours .   from the moment that the opening title appeared ,  i knew we were in for a ride .  paul greengrass has done it again .  everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again :  the action ,  the dialogue ,  and of course the shaky camera .  however for me ,  that last one was never a problem .  i think it adds to the suspense .   i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd ,  simply because it is genius .  it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion ,  and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie ,  and altogether ,  an unforgettable trilogy . 
this movie was a major disappointment on direction ,  intellectual niveau ,  plot and in the way it dealt with its subject ,  painting .  it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years ,  with appalling lack of depth though .  it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner .   the approach to the subject of painting is very elite ,  limited to vague and subjective terms as  " beauty "  .  according to the makers of this movie ,  'beauty' can be only experienced in bob-ross-style kitschy landscape paintings .  good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic  ( like ,  primary school level )  color theory and lots of sentiment .  in parts the movie is offending ,  e . g .  at a point it is stated  ( rather ,  celebrated by dancing on tables )  that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting ,  their works by definition being worthless 'bullshit'  ( quote )  .   i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating ,  then again ,  so far not many people rated it ,  and they chose for only very high or very low grades . 
this place in england during 1940 .  three orphans  ( carrie ,  charles and paul )  are sent to live with miss price  ( angela lansbury )  .  she doesn't want them but reluctantly takes them in .  it seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the college of witchcraft .   ( ok--i realize this is a family film but--college of witchcraft ?  ?  ?  come on !  !  )  before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war  (  ?  ?  ?  )  and she seeks down the head professor browne  ( david tomlinson )  .  and her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob .   i first saw this when i was 9 and vaguely remember loving it .  it sure doesn't hold up as an adult !  the story is silly  ( even for a fantasy )  ,  the kids are terrible actors and one of them  ( charles )  is incredibly obnoxious .  also roddy mcdowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes !  there's also a trip to the isle of naboombu which is run by animated animals .  i thought that might be fun but the animation is poor  ( for disney )  and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals .  there are a few saving graces here :  lansbury and tomlinson are just great ;  the songs  ( while forgettable )  are pleasant ;  the long dance sequence on portobello road is very colorful and full of energy and the oscar-winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end .  but the weak story line ,  poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down .  i heard the extended version is even worse !  i can only give this a 7 . 
i was pleasantly surprised i quite liked this movie .  witty writing  ( some  " inside "  jokes i got ,  others i didn't - maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another )  ,  great acting  ( notably john cassini )  ,  great cameos ,  interesting and unique directing .  i rented it to see jeffrey meek  ( very disappointed he was in it such a short time ,  blink and you'll miss him !  )  but found the movie remarkably entertaining .  i'll actually watch it again before i send back to netflix .  i think actors and wanna-be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie .  the ending is somewhat expected but wish they'd done something different  ( and more positive )  .  too bad the movie wasn't better received except for in the  " festival "  market .  i suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz . 
i just came back from  " el otro "  playing here in buenos aires and i have to say i was very disappointed .  the film is very slow moving  ( don't get me wrong ,  i enjoy slow moving films !  )  ,  slow to the point of driving you crazy .  all you hear is julio chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film .  this is a poorly made film ,  but more importantly ,  it is a film without a lick of inspiration ,  i felt nothing for the story or its characters .    " el otro "  was made only for the sake of making a film .  .  .  making it forgetful .  i would advise you to pass on this one ,  if you want to see good argentinian films ,  look for films by sorin . 
although i live in minnesota ,  i have been studying in france lately and came across this bizarre gem of a film .   this movie was amazing ,  to say the least .  a creative and unique film ,  the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light .  the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline ,  much as can be done with 2003's love actually .  this attempt ,  however ,  renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete .  when taken at face value ,  with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film ,  the love stories together tell a beautiful message .   the film is strikingly bizarre at times -- often to the point of confusion -- and each individual segment can be hard to follow .  still ,  to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments ,  the short plot lines become clear after a short time .  the confusion is almost intriguing ;  it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next .  it leaves the viewer wondering  " did that really just happen ?  "  yet also leaves them satisfied that it did ,  indeed ,  occur .  it's the kind of movie where the viewer ,  upon leaving the theater ,  can't actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it .  the initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again ,  just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiece .   the interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate .  it adds to the reality of the film -- here ,  the american tourists speak english ,  the parisians french ,  and so on .  the number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love .   from sickness to the supernatural ,  the love of parents to the love of husbands ,  this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling .  in its beautiful and quirky way ,  each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story :  that of all types ,  sizes ,  nationalities ,  and shapes of love . 
damn ,  was that a lot to take in .  i was pretty much mesmerised throughout .  it was pretty perfect ,  though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that .  i can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them  ( anton especially )  to get all of this footage without any serious .  .  .  beef .  the dandy's did come off well-together ,  middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation  ( and rightly so !  )  .  i felt bad for jonestown and especially for anton ,  which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt .  great piece of film-making and great choice of subject ( s )  .  i recommend this to any music/film fan .  you'll probably learn something about film-making . 
as other viewers have mentioned ,  this film was an interesting experiment in photography .  the colors are comic book bold .  i think the director got carried away with his  " artistic vision "  over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content .  despite its stellar cast ,  the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent .  madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press .  a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album  " i'm breathless  ( music inspired by the film dick tracy )  "  which was a stratospheric hit  ( due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit  " vogue "  - which is not in ,  nor has the slightest relation to this film )  .  i'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to madonna's  " i'm breathless "  album .   if you watch it at home ,  by end-titles ,  you'll think  " there's two hours out of my life i'd like to have back .  "  save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this . 
this movie took the jerry springer approach to super-human power .   " wilder napalm "  is the kind of theme-based movie that i love ,  addressing the idea that prodigies in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them .  at the same time ,  the movie points out that every prodigy is only human ,  and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being .  this was a great comedy ,  fun and human with that slight satiric edge . 
i was fully amped up to see this film .  i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand .  i shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clark's worst film there is so much wrong with this film .  first off ,  some of the acting is great ,  in particular nick stahl as 'the bully' ,  and the girl with the curly brown hair  ( i can't recall her name )  ,  but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable ,  especially leo fitzpatrick .  he's a veteran of clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'kids' ,  but in 'bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually .  the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student .  no sorry ,  a high school student .  .  . one who has never seen a movie before .  and i couldn't fathom clark's intentions .  was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence ?  it sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv .  i'm no prude but i didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes .  i still maintain that clark's best film is 'another day in paradise' .  it's fantastic and i don't think he'll ever top it . 
this is the only movie i have ever walked out on .  bad acting-- bad plot-- bad casting-- bad directing-- bad cinematography-- if they had set out to make a bad picture they couldn't have done a better job .  i hope they are proud of his turkey .  i'm surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood .  don't waste your time ! 
the director and two stars of laura  ( 1944 )  were reteamed for this solid policier :  dana andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and ,  one night ,  he goes too far ;  gene tierney is the estranged wife of his victim ,  a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and andrews' no .  1 nemesis ,  gary merrill  ( who had himself been the protégé of andrews snr .  )  !  as usual with preminger ,  this is a well-crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes karl malden  ( as andrews' incumbent superior )  ,  tom tully  ( as tierney's motor-mouth taxi driver dad )  and neville brand  ( as merrill's chief thug )  ,  with notable support also coming from craig stevens  ( as the slimy ,  wife-beating victim )  ,  bert freed  ( as andrews' sympathetic partner )  and robert f .  nolan  ( as andrews' stern outgoing superior )  .  having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else ,  andrews panics and impersonates stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the  ( in this case )  wrong tracks of merrill ;  however ,  after tully becomes the prime suspect  ( by which time andrews and tierney are romantically involved )  ,  the cop goes by himself in merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder !  clearly ,  the protagonist is a complex character and andrews rises to the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in-house fox noir style . 
the obvious parallels between walt disney's charming fantasy bedknobs and broomsticks and c . s .  lewis chronicles of narnia are pretty apparent .  there are more coincidences here than comparing bedknobs and broomsticks than with mary poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney films .   like the chronicles of narnia it involves some english children leaving london during the blitz and coming to live in the country .  and those kids have to deal with a world of magic .  but unlike c . s .  lewis the rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now .  no retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the pevensie kids .   no heavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like david tomlinson .  ms .  lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing .  she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldn't top .  and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this film .   two performers made their farewell to films in bedknobs and broomsticks .  tessie o'shea played her last role in this film ,  she graced many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers .  and that grand character actor reginald owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world .   the team of robert b .  sherman and richard m .  sherman who wrote the score for mary poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here .  the age of not believing was nominated for an oscar ,  but lost to the theme from shaft .  personally though i do like david tomlinson's tribute to that most colorful of london streets ,  portabello road .   bedknobs and broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years .  imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics . 
rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions ,  which could have kept away many film goers looking for a pianist similar plot .  fortunately ,  von trotta ,  a good screenwriter ,  opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior ,  but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary aryan german rather from a jewish standpoint .  rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims .  the pace of the film is introspective ,  poignantly slow ,  meditative .  besides ,  the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been deftly crafted .  rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece ,  and some narrative flaws are well discerned .  another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters .  nevertheless ,  this film is worth seeing .  finally ,  rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in german films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past , trend that includes such excellent films as nowhere in africa ,  and recently ,  the controversial downfall .  i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images . 
this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards !  i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film .  it's great to see j . beals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes .  m . parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for .  the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable .  the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch .  there is no real emotional depth to the story .  a movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me .  nor does the development of the cop .  it feels like one of many straight-to-video movies i saw back in the 90s  .  .  .  and not even a good one in those standards .   
amongst the standard one liner type action films ,  where acting and logic are checked at the door ,  this movie is at the top of the class .  if the person in charge of casting were to have put  " good "  actors in this flick ,  it would have been worse ( excepting richard dawson who actually did act well ,  if you can call playing yourself  " acting "  )  .  i love this movie !  the running man is in all likelihood god's gift to man ( okay maybe just men )  .  definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i'll part you with my favorite line :   " it's all part of life's rich pattern brenda ,  and you better f*****g get used to it .  "  ahh ,  more people have been called  " brenda "  for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine . 
i didn't really expect much from  " the night listener "  and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the videostore .  however ,  the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension .  on occasion it drags a little ,  but it actually helps to keep you wondering what's going to happen and more importantly :  when .  as the movie progresses ,  the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of  " cat and mouse "  spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no-one seemed to have ever seen in person .  the night listener is an interesting story ,  which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what's real .  however ,  in the end it kind of disappoints and doesn't live up to the potential it could have had .  it doesn't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character ,  which would have been helpful and interesting . 
i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a year . attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first-time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever widening seagal . visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes . sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come .   seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the trashy-but enjoyable shadow man last time we saw him . however attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever ! don't argue for out for a kill , ticker , or even black dawn folks . this is the bottom of the septic tank here .   anyone who says this is steven seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word taste .    seagal is yet another agent/i'm a supreme bad-ass yet again named lawson wants revenge for the killing of his team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public . not to mention the dealers are not from around here .   the whole production from directing to the acting is poor . was this movie shot in the dark ? its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since howling 2 . the action is terrible and very badly done .   the producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most : throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed steven seagal . who seems to show little enthusiasm here . can ya blame him ?   while it has been said that attack force was not the movie stevie signed on for ( originally harvester ) and surely has to be better than attack force . the post-production tampering has not made it more coherent and made seagal look worse . i feel bad for directer michael keusch and writer joe halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill-advised production re-shoots .   so now this leaves seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess . but after seeing how bad attack force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie ? 
back in the day of the big studio system ,  the darndest casting decisions were made .  good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner .  had i been casting the film ,  the part of kralik would have been perfect for charles boyer .  his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing .  stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret sullavan .   margaret sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen ,  he did four films with her .  but is only this one where neither of them dies .  sullavan and her husband leland heyward knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york .  in fact sullavan's husband was stewart's good friend henry fonda back then .   i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non-americans in mutiny on the bounty .  stewart in the mortal storm was german ,  but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out .    but if you can accept stewart ,  than you'll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch .  the plot is pretty simple ,  a man and woman working in a department store in budapest don't get along in person .  but it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other .  also employer frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife .    though the leads are fine and frank morgan departs from his usual befuddled self ,  the two players who come off best are felix bressart and joseph schildkraut .  bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions .  he makes himself very scarce .   and joseph schildkraut ,  who is always good ,  is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan .  you really hate people like that ,  i've known too many like schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day .  sad that it pays off a good deal of the time . 
french production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of september 11 .   the film segments vary widely in content and quality .  two allude to u . s .  complicity in terrorist acts  ( in chile against allende ,  who died on september 11 ,  1973 ,  depicted in the segment by british director ken loach ;  and in palestine by u . s . -backed israelis ,  shown in the segment from egyptian director youssef chahine )  .  two more recall other destructive acts  ( a palestinian suicide bombing in tel aviv ,  shot by israeli director amos gitan ;  the japanese  " holy war "  against the west in ww ii ,  by shohei imamura )  .   ironies abound in several stories .  shadows that darken the new york city apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the world trade towers telescope to the ground in sean penn's piece ,  bringing the man momentary joy .  but in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone .  in mira nair's film ,  based on a real incident ,  a missing young man ,  also in new york city ,  the son of a pakistani family ,  is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist ,  but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers .   there are poignant moments dotted throughout .  loach has his exiled chilean man quote st .  augustine ,  to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage :  anger at the way things are ,  courage to change them .  imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war .  samira makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young afghan schoolchildren ,  exiled in iran ,  trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in new york .  but they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp ,  where two men have fallen into a deep well ,  one killed ,  the other sustaining a broken leg .  this is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds .    idrissa ouedraogo ,  from burkina faso ,  creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots osama bin laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist ,  in order to get the $25 million u .  s .  reward .  he tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans ,  for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes ,  while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute .   it is mexican director alejandro gonzalez inarritu  ( maker of  " amores perros "  )  who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment ,  one that ,  for the most part ,  shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds .  brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers ,  and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground .  the sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot ,  bearing a phrase first shown only in arabic ,  then with a translation added :   " does god's light guide us or blind us ?  "   ( in various languages with english subtitles )  grade :  8/10  ( b+ )  .   ( seen on 10/31/04 )  .  if you'd like to read more of my reviews ,  send me a message for directions to my websites . 
before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube ,  i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to rewatch something i first saw on the tv ads in 1980 :  barbara bach's cleavage .  and since the movie received an r rating ,  i expected to see her nude .  alas ,  no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here :  stacey nelkin who's supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this .  seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as ms .  bach .  they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides .  in fact ,  i don't blame ron leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tight-fisted liceman is pretty embarrassing though i did like the  " seduction "  scene he did with ms .  nelkin .  this also happens to be the debut of ralph macchio who's the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school .  the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms .  bach ,  an arab who worships motor oil ,  and a politician's son who loves his girlfriend candy  ( nelkin's character )  so much ,  he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy .  among the supporting cast ,  tom poston plays a swishy character named sisson who i found partly amusing .  with a screenplay by tom patchett and jay tarses and direction by robert downey sr .   ( whose son robert downey jr .  has a cameo early on in a soccer scene )  ,  up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you're really offended at the scatological and sexual content ,  this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boy-alfred e .  newman-shouldn't be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture .  .  . p . s .  another one of the  " misfits "  was harry teinowitz who was born in my birth town of chicago ,  ill .  he played rodney ververgaert .  he also says one of my favorite lines :   " i'm trying to come .  " 
just another example of why stepehn king's books should not be made into movies .   ( even carrie ,  one of the best ,  is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen .  )  the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer ,  always on a diet ,  who  " accidentally "  kills an old gypsy woman .  in court ,  with the help of the judge and the local police chief ,  he gets off ,  even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving .  the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 ,  with our main character ,  billy  ( the lawyer )  getting thinner and thinner by the day .  though the movie kept with the book ,  for the most part ,  and has your typical king ending ,  the acting was stilted and felt forced .  we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between ,  sort of like reading acts in a play .  king himself made a cameo in the movie  ( sort of like dave barry )  ,  which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that :  authors .  leave the acting to actors .  not that anyone in this movie was that great .  i've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better . 
assassin hauser's  ( john cusak )  mission is to whack a mid-eastern oil minister ,  whose name happens to be omar sharif  ( neikov )  ,  in the country of turaqistan which is run by american interests .  hauser poses as trade show producer to allow him to get to omar .   sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying .  here it does too much :  the government ,  politics ,  music ,  war ,  people not generally accepted by society ,  and did i mention  " war .  "  and ,  that is what we have here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life .  i am still asking myself why i continued with the dvd .  also ,  there are so many cusak family members in this that john cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there ,  or is that just me ?   it used to be that a john cusak movie ,  while a little offbeat ,  was ,  in the end ,  rather good .  not here .  believe that john cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess .  make of that what you will .   there is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun-fire ,  bombings ,  and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point ?  probably .  it just takes too long to set up the hit ,  which is largely forgotten until the last 15-minutes .  in the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast .  and ,  chemistry between john cusak and marisa tormei ?  i don't think so ,  but you know :  the boy  girl thing and they needed something to take up more time .    yes ,  for what they were supposed to be ,   ( offbeat and annoying )  the performances of duff ,  and kingsley were good .  but ,  when i saw dan aykroyd's character ,  in the beginning of the show ,  sitting on a toilet taking a dump ,  i knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well .  i was not wrong .  i am sure some will sing praises of this effort ,  but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so ,  too ,  is a mess  i now remember why i continued with the dvd .  i was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself .  never did .   violence :  yes .  sex :  no .  nudity :  no .  language :  yes . 
this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen .  i'm not exaggerating ,  i told the guy at blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves .  the only thing interesting about this movie is the box .  on the box it says  " from the director of the boogeyman "  so i figured .  .  . eh whatever ,  if this was made recently i'm sure the directing at least won't be too bad  : -\ ,  but after i saw the movie and looked at what  " boogeyman "  they were talking about ,  it's some nonsense from the early 1980's that he made .  great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers .   anyway ,  i think that they just liked the name  " zodiac killer "  ,  and didn't bother to research any of the actual zodiac's crimes or his mo ,  or even the years that he was active .  all of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the  " stories "  about the original zodiac take place several years after the actual zodiac's crimes did .  they also compare the zodiac to  " vampire of dusseldorf "  fritz haarman throughout the movie and talk to fritz's  " son "  quite often .  the zodiac and haarman were nothing alike ,  and it makes more sense to compare him to btk who also shot people ,  not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks .  none of the haarman facts are correct either ,  just a bunch of jumbled nonsense .  his son even says  " don't forget ,  his name was fritz haarman with 2 t's "  .  .  . his actual name just has one !  i think that the writer/director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the zodiac killer and fritz haarman .   " ooh those sound like cool names ,  let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research !  great idea !  "   perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from dsm-iv and getting cured of it .   " i was also diagnosed with dsm-iv and have since recovered "  ,  etc .  for those of you who don't know ,  dsm-iv is the psychological manual for mental disorders .  if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems !  haha .   anyway ,  my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list ,  and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point .  but ,  if you are interested in watching a totally non-fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring ,  full of inexperienced actors ,  and not completely rational ,  i'd say check out this movie .    .  .  . oh ,  and i liked how the killer  " tear gassed "  a few of his victims with dry ice .  nice touch .  .  . 
once upon a time ,  there were different types of movies .  these different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer .  .  .  .   this seems obvious at first ,  but i thought i'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten .  this is just a fun movie for pavarotti fans .  that's all it is .  it doesn't claim to be anything else or anything grander .  people who deride it as something that fell short of a promise aren't seeing the whole picture- literally .  after all ,  hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people  ( bodyguard or the preacher's wife w/whitney houston are 2 examples that spring to mind .  )   first i'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for pavarotti .  there are worse things in this world-- and worse movies .  the singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun .  the movie starts with schubert's ave maria and then leoncavallo's matinatta .  pav sings arias from la gioconda ,  manon lescaut ,  and turandot but also sings popular music such as  " i left my heart in san francisco "  and the song that was nominated for an oscar & golden globe ,   " if we were in love "  w/music by john williams & lyrics by alan & marilyn bergman- all 3 previous oscar winners .   the story isn't that bad .  it was built for pavarotti so of course it's not going to be something that's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer .  it's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago .  when asked to sing again at the same place ,  the  " met "  in nyc ,  he loses his voice from fear .  doctor pamela  ( or pah-may-lah in italian :  )  )  played by kathryn harrold- gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction .  he offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts .   they embark on an affair ,  she knowing he's married & promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman .  despite all that ,  they fall in love  ( thus the song ,   " if we were in love "  )  and with her help ,  he overcomes his fear & goes back to the met where he triumphs .  i won't tell how it ends ,  but it's fairly predictable .  which isn't always a bad thing .    the performances in this aren't that bad .  pavarotti  ( who plays giorgio fini )  isn't an actor ,  so if you're expecting a spencer tracy or tom hanks performance ,  you are deluded ,  not pavarotti .  he knows he's not a thespian .  what he is is cute ,  charming & charismatic .  he is having fun himself ,  and if you can just let yourself have fun too ,  it's not so bad .  one funny line is when he tells pamela  ( harrold )  that she's a  " thirsty plant ,  fini can water you !  "  and of course ,  she says ,   " i don't want to be watered on by fini !  "  kathryn harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi-uptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little .  one of my favorite lines in the movie is :   " life never has to be life size .  "  and there's eddie albert who does his usual good job as fini's manager .  there are several  " themselves "  cameos by real conductors ,  singers ,  etc .  and it is filmed on location at the metropolitan opera at lincoln center .    if you like opera ,  if you like pavarotti ,  or if you can just let yourself go & enjoy a  " little fling "  just like he proposes in the movie- then you can enjoy this movie for what it is .  i know i do- every time .   :  )   
that's what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film .  first off ,  the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing !  those computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back .  the rest of the movie ,  though .  .  .   none of the characters act in a realistic manner ,  especially in the aforementioned ,  despicable 3rd act  ( i promise i won't give it away ,  but trust me ,  it's not worth keeping a secret !  )  .  a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally ,  like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work .  please ,  give the viewers more credit than that !  !  !   some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting .  what would you do ,  after all ,  if you were invisible ?  no one could catch you !  these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from 1933 .  there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous ,  and is not mentioned once later on .  if more attention had been paid it ,  kevin bacon's mad scientist might have made a little more sense .    the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno ,  since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner .  but this piece of work .  .  .  go see something else .  or don't ,  and live with the consequences !   3/10
the bad out takes from  " reign of fire "  strung together ,  without any real story .   dean cain tries to be a real actor ,  and fails again .   in the end the dragons quit in disgust .   barf ! 
there's been a vogue for the past few years for often-as-not ironic zombie-related films ,  as well as other media incarnations of the flesh- eating resurrected dead .   " fido "  is a film that's either an attempt to cash in on that ,  simply a manifestation of it ,  or both -- and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies .  the joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped ,  squeaky-clean ,  alternate-history  ( we are in the wake of a great zombie war ,  and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves )  version of a 1950s suburb .    it's a moderately funny concept on its own ,  and enough perhaps for a five-minute comedy sketch ,  but it can't hold up a feature-film on its own .  the joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again ,  and loses all effectiveness .  the soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders .  the word  " zombie "  is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh .    the very broadness and artificiality of the representation of  " the nineteen fifties "  here can't help but irritate me .  it is so stylized ,  in it evidently  " pleasantville- " inspired way ,  that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950s-ness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959 .  there is something obnoxiously sneering about it ,  as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open ,  down-to-earth ,  and superior the 2000s are .    because the characters are such broad representations of pop-culture 1950s  " types ,  "  it's difficult to develop much emotional investment in them .  each has a few character traits thrown at him or her -- helen is obsessed with appearances ,  and bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father -- but they remain quite two-dimensional .  performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine .  the best is billy connolly as fido the zombie ,  who in the tradition of boris karloff in  " frankenstein "  actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak .    there are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around -- to commodity fetishism ,  racism ,  classism ,  war paranoia ,  et cetera ,  but none of it really works on a comprehensive level ,  and the filmmakers don ; t really stick with anything .    unfortunately ,  this film doesn't really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of  " look !  zombies in 'leave it to beaver ! ' "  for a good hour- and-a-half . 
i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie  " rocked "  .  it is pure cg over-acted crap !  don't send an assassin ,  it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored ,  aggressive ,  venomous snakes on a plane !  the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to .  it is not  " so bad it's good "  it's so bad i'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again .  i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane !  a spoof !  was i wrong .  it's that whole  " it sucks ,  get it !  "  or samuel a .  jackson yells  " snakes on the plane !  thing .  well i'm sorry ,  i don't get it .  it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard .  if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung's cd ,  still live in their mommies basement ,  and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn ,  then rush to the theater and ask for one  ( since i doubt you have a girlfriend )  ticket for snakes on a stupid-butt plane .  to hell with movies like full metal jacket ,  pulp fiction ,  true romance ,  12 monkeys ,  clerks ,  etc .  there's no irony in watching good movies .  the true decline of the western civilization .  calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man ,  or even orgazmo .  i've said enough here . 
this film ,  originally released at christmas ,  1940 ,  was long thought lost .  a very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a cd ,  now for sale .  don't buy it !  the film is unspeakably terrible .  the casting is poor ,  the script is awful ,  and the directing is dreadful .   picture roland young singing and dancing .  and that was the highlight .   perhaps this movie was lost deliberately . 
   i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same .  mainly because of my feelings at the end .  i and all the people around me were simply touched .  this is something you don't often feel  .  we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality ,  lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films .  the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard ,  a man on the verge of a breakdown .  this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous ,  humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie .    the acting from branagh and bonham-carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role .  the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie .    the title comes from richards masterpiece ,  a plane made of junk and his old paintings .  flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end .    a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone .  don't let the subject matter put you off . 
i think that's this is awful produced and directed movie .  benicio del toro shouldn't work in production of movies ,  he should put accent on his acting and that's it .  steven soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution ,  about it's ideals ,  and most important about life of che guevara and so on .  camera is awful ,  like someone with 2 day working experience is shooting with it ,  music is  .  .  . i don't know .  . is there some music in the movie ?  ?  ?  ?  i will not recommended this piece of sh .  .  to no one .  it's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the tv or whatever .  .  .  .  i can't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than 3 stars .  disaster .  .  .  . disaster .  .  .  . disaster .  .  .  . disaster don't watch please .  save yourself from this misery of  " movie " 
i made the big mistake of actually watching this whole movie a few nights ago .  god i'm still trying to recover .  this movie does not even deserve a 1 . 4 average .  imdb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one .  a 1 . 4 is too high .   i had heard how awful this movie was ,  but i really did not think a movie could actually be that bad ,  especially in this day and era .  i figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s .  my god was i wrong .  trust me folks ,  this movie really is that bad .  it is beyond horrible ;  it is beyond pathetic ;  it is beyond any type of word that i can think of for it .  battlefield earth looks like best picture of the year compared to this movie .  snake island  ( which up until now was the worst movie i'd ever seen )  looks like it deserves a few oscars compared to this pathetic effort .   i seriously can not believe that the makers of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a hollywood movie .  this has no business being called a movie .  in the first 25 seconds of the film ,  i seriously thought i was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie .  or better yet ,  i thought it was some saturday night live ripoff skit of the real thing .  i mean ,  it looks exactly like that .  the acting is horrible ;  the whole movie almost looks like it was shot with a 20 year old vhs video camera .  the special effects .  .  .  .  .  .  . well good lord bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie .  the scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy .  i mean seriously ,  my intro to acting class from 4 years ago in college ,  all of us could have put together a better movie than this .  and the worst part of the entire movie ,  where arthur is naked in the bathroom .  oh my god i almost thew up right there .  i have a strong stomach ,  but wow that was horrible .  some people should never be naked ,  and he's one of them .  the plot of this movie just seems to go absolutely nowhere .  they talk about legal issues that we never hear about again ;  ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again ;  arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he's running a porn shop .  everything about the movie is just horrible .   this really doesn't have much to do with my critique ,  but just so everyone knows ,  i am not a gay man .  i do however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals .  and i would support any gay person in my church ,  unlike the cruel priest in this movie ,  who by the way seems to cuss every other word .   ( where is the f* ( #*ing white out ?  )  hahaha but i didn't want anyone to think i hated this movie just because of it being about two gay guys .  it has nothing to do with that :  this would have been just as horrible of a movie if it was ben & jill instead of ben & arthur .   i just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say .  and yes it was even worse than i had read .  let this be a warning to everyone :  only watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be .  if you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment ,  i have no sympathy for you whatsoever .   on a final thought :  how in the world are there 7 movies ranked below this on imdb ?  there is no way there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this ! 
this movie was a horrible excuse for .  .  . a movie .  first of all ,  the casting could have been better ;  katelyn the main character looked nothing like her tv mom .    also ,  the plot was pathedic .  it was extremely cliché and predictable .  the ending was very disappointing and cheesy .   ( but thats all i'll say about that )  .    the nail in the bag though ,  was a scene when katelyn  ( jordan hinson )  was supposed to be crying ,  but the girl couldn't cry on command !  there were no tears streaming down her face ,  just a few unbelievable sobs .  she is not a dynamic actress at all .  she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire  ( sp ?  )  .  thats when the movie went from not-so-good ,  to just plain bad .  it really looked like she was acting .    in a nutshell :  this movie was really bad !  it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990's that everyone's sick of--only worse !   i give it an 'f' ,  because it was just so darn hard to sit through  ( b/t/w ,  i was babysitting when i saw it )  .    however ,  you may like it if your 9 or under .   ;  ) 
this show is not clever .  that's basically what it boils down to .  the  " original humor "  that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny .  in another comment ,  someone quotes a couple hilarious lines .  the standout for me was george h . w .  bush telling the kids they're not supposed to watch any tv besides fox news .  wow .  i thought the episodes i saw were bad .  the fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic .   my problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season .  i'm a liberal republican and i know bush hasn't been a good president .  we all do .  but that's no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time .  i place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'meet the spartans' .  their formula ,  bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit .   again ,  just plain bad .  unfunny ,  and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed ,  but amazing and original shows like arrested development are canned after 3 solid seasons .  please don't watch this crap ,  unless you're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words bush and dumb is comedic gold .    oh ,  and the voice of bush sucks .  all he does is slightly emulate a texan accent ,  and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences .  at least south park admits the voices aren't accurate .  if you want funny political satire ,  watch daily show/colbert .  or look for any political sketches on robot chicken ,  which is fun to watch ,  since the stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done .  look for the george bush as a jedi bit on youtube .  priceless
is this the future that awaits us ?  an overpopulated ,  unforgiving wasteland with a hellish ,  unwanted existence ?  this film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us ,  doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973 .  let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this .  .  .   soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much .  it had likable characters ,  a semi-apocalyptic setting ,  a compelling and thought-provoking storyline ,  and the macho-est macho man out there :  charleton heston .  richard fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant ,  dirty feel .  you're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants .   the characters are wonderful .  charleton heston ,  who has become one of my favorite actors ,  is thorn .  the man created this role of badass ,  yet likable tough-guy .  i could definitely put myself in thorn's shoes .  he sees that something isn't right ,  but everyone around him either doesn't listen  ( more like paid not to listen )  or wants him dead .  edward g .  robinson  ( in his last film ,  r . i . p .  )  plays the lovable old sol ,  who has had enough of this nasty place .  everyone else is great ,  especially leigh taylor-young as shirl ,  a piece of  " furniture "  that comes with the apartment in which she resides .   the special effects are fantastic ,  even for 1973 .  the soylent green factory ,  the futuristic apartments ,  and especially the  " scoops "   ( bulldozers that get rid of people )  were excellent .  the polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty .  the empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling .   one final note is the ending ,  which even now still shocked me .  it is gruesome ,  but if you think about it ,  it's a pretty good idea .   the bottom line :    an excellent 70's science fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy . 
a meltdown at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal ,  rot-faced ,  shambling zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage .  a ragtag handful of uninfected folks do their best to survive this grueling ordeal .  director/co-writer/producer todd sheets displays an appealingly sincere love and passion for go-straight-for-the-throat lively and gruesome horror fare :  he maintains an unflagging snappy pace throughout ,  fills the screen with wall-to-wall crazy action ,  and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum .  moreover ,  sheets certainly doesn't skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over-the-top splatter :  this picture delivers a tasty truckload of flesh melting ,  evisceration ,  lots of gut munching ,  one dude has his heart yanked out ,  and there's even a nice impalement on a tree branch .  sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end  ( for example ,  almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow )  .  granted ,  this flick has its fair share of flaws :  the ragged editing ,  several ham-fisted attempts at pathos ,  and the largely awful acting from a rank no-name cast all leave a good deal to be desired .  top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky kasey rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful daria trumillio .  frank dunlay likewise does well as rugged take-charge army veteran ralph walsh .  best of all ,  sheets' sure grasp of an infectiously slambang sense of unrelenting headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish . 
it's really annoying when good movies like this one go unnoticed .  but i'm glad i did not miss it .   they should re-release it with a lot more publicity .  i do not think they did anything to promote it .  great work paxton .   
i find it rather useless to comment on this  " movie "  for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon . it's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it .  but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance  .  .  .    filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian  " movie "  directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called  " romanian reality "  following the communist era  ( 1990 to present days )  .   under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others  ( who lately find amateurish camera ,  lack of plot ,  lack of directorial / actors's quality etc ,  noise etc .  as being trendy and even art-like )   :  watch & enjoy this  " movie "   ( as i know you will )  but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor ,  don't write an online review for it will misguide ,  irritate and in the end waste their time .   on the other hand this movie  ( among others )  has some value whatsoever ,  an educational one for it sets the example for  :   " how not to make a movie .  " 
i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience .  as we put our boats into the water ,  banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind .  this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature .  we see it in the bow fishing .  we see it in the home made tent .  there is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman  " cracker "  .  the fact that the banker from atlanta  ( ned beatty )  has  " bad teeth "  is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth .  ultimately ,  the struggle of life and death supersedes  " civilized man's "  suppositives about  " the law "  .  this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer ,  but alas not soon enough for the characters . 
in late 1800s san francisco ,  poor well-dressed errol flynn  ( as james j .  corbett )  works at a bank ,  and enjoys attending local  " fights "   ( boxing )  with co-worker and drinking buddy jack carson  ( as walter lowrie )  .  one day ,  pretty alexis smith  ( as victoria ware )  walks into the  " comstock bank "  ,  where mr .  flynn works .  flynn is so taken with ms .  smith's elegant beauty ,  he offers to carry her withdrawal purse .  smith is secretly taken with the handsome flynn ,  but is put off by his brashness .   flynn's good deed  ( actually ,  pick-up attempt )  gets him a complimentary membership in the snooty  " olympic club "  ,  which conveniently includes a gymnasium  ( with boxing equipment )  .  however ,  flynn's presumptuous manner ,  and practical joking  ( he tickles men on the parallel bars )  irritates  " club "  members .  when an english boxing champ visits the club ,  members endeavor to get flynn to fight the man .  they are hopeful flynn will resign ,  humiliated by his defeat - but ,  flynn wins !    first time producer robert buckner puts together a nice package for warner brothers ,  and director raoul walsh .  mr .  buckner was ,  certainly ,  basking in the success of his contribution  ( screenplay )  to the studio's brilliant  " yankee doodle dandy "  .  unfortunately ,  this story is positively ludicrous .  there was a  " gentleman jim "  - this story is supposedly the filming of the real james j .  corbett's autobiography  " the roar of the crowd "  - but ,  this movie must be significantly fictionalized .   flynn is a very appealing leading man ;  he maneuvers the script lightly ,  and should have been recognized ,  by the early 1940s ,  as an excellent actor .  many of flynn's characterizations were  ( are ?  )  overlooked as great performances ,  and this is one of them .  smith does well as his feminine interest ,  deftly transmitting her emotions for the viewer .  director walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant .  the supporting cast is a treasure trove ,  from boisterous alan hale  ( as pat corbett )  to walk-on lon mccallister  (  " paging mr .  corbett "  )  .   ******** gentleman jim  ( 1942 )  raoul walsh ~ errol flynn ,  alexis smith ,  alan hale
hooper is not funny ,  not fasted paced ,  not romantic and non informative .  there is no real drama .  you would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama ,  there was an attempt but it didn't seem real .  no character study ,  no lessons learned ,  it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun ,  they were just trying to act like they were having fun .  there is no reason to watch unless you like to look at burt and want get an occasional glimpse of sally .  prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do .  in fact prancer was the best actor in this movie .  smoky and the bandit was such a fun movie that i was ready to like hooper .  this movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time
when a small hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle ,  the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord .  should the ring end up back in his hands ,  he will regain his power and destroy middle earth .  frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors .  this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story .  regardless ,  this is an epic and wonderfully animated film .   the animation is superbly done with rotoscope ,  which is tracing over live action footage .  ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given .  the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard rosenman that fits every scene .  there are a few plot holes with the script ,  but that has to be excused ,  considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films ,  much had to crammed in the first one .  my biggest gripe is some of the character design ,  samwise was a bit too goofy ,  while the other hobbits act completely normal .  the other characters are actually well written for the screen ,  and the voice actors do a great job ,  i was pleased that legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot .  the rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening ,  while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish .   another problem is that the evil wizard saruman is called aruman ,  thanks to the writers .  overall ,  i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice ,  but there is something charming about it .  ralph bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories .  the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films ,  but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages . 
when you look at this now and hear all the language in here ,  it's amazing this was rated  " pg ,  "  but that's the 1970s rating system for you .  peter falk spews out the lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie !  yet ,  few people consider that offensive ,  and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who  " rate "  them .   the cast is a clue to how profane this film can be :  falk ,  peter boyle ,  allen garfield ,  warren oates ,  gena rowlands and paul sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in  " the sound of music .  "   i like heist movies ,  and a lot of films by director william friedkin ,  but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the  " sleazy '70s "  feel to it ,  visually and audibly .  for those who loved falk in tv's  " columbo "  it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films .  this is far from the only case . 
i was about 12 years old when i saw this classic  " casper the friendly ghost "  cartoon .  figured it was an early one since casper didn't look *right* ,  the same way porky pig doesn't look *right* in the old 1930's cartoons .  but i digress .  .  .   anyway ,  this episode in the friendly phantom's afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names ferdie .  i remember being happy to see casper have a friend ,  as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him ,  screaming  " a ghost !  "   casper and ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows up .  .  .  i hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler ,  but the cartoon is only seven minutes long ,  so you can't really be too ambiguous .  besides ,  anyone who reads the imdb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens next .  .  .   the finale is a bit heartbreaking .  in fact ,  it's probably the saddest i've ever felt watching a cartoon .  but that only means that it moved me ,  which probably explains why i decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others .  or heck ,  the fact that i actually remember this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me -- i haven't seen it since .  but the cartoon does end on an upbeat note ,  and i was pleased to see casper and ferdie happy again .   i'd give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars .  second only to the warner bros .  cartoon  " peace on earth ,  "  this is the most i've ever been moved by an animated short . 
having lived in ontario my whole life ,  in the same town that marlene moore grew up in ,  i've heard stories of her from my parents ,  grandparents and family members .  so when i found out that they would be filming a movie about her ,  and that the beginning would be shot on my street ,  and her house quite close to mine i was excited .   if you read the book rock a bye baby ,  which is about marlene moore you get quite the different image of her as a person ,  she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child ,  with the exception of one of her brothers .  also ,  if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you'd find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution ,  she was always defensive and what would seem like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to .   marlene did not deserve the life she was given ,  with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive .  it was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did .  i still find myself angered that she was put in jail for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her .  as her brother once said ,   " they didn't know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her .  "  i believe in that with all my heart .   rest in peace marlene ,  you deserve it so much . 
i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set .  i am watching them with my soon-to-be seven-year old daughter ,  which makes most of these movies a laugh riot .   i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies ,  after watching white zombie ,  which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema  ( think clive barker's serpent and the rainbow and james bond's live and let die funeral scene ,  not night of the living dead )  .   however ,  even though the title includes the word  " zombies ,  "  it is little more than a love triangle ,  involving anthropologist armand louque ,  who is smitten with claire duval ;  who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson .  what a yawn-fest ,  my daughter fell asleep half-way through .   i had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for -- the allies or the axis ;  but ,  i guess that doesn't really matter .   i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie ;  but ,  of course those were his eyes  ( from white zombie )  serving as the mind-control device for the zombies . 
the rating is only a 5 because it's a movie that could have used better acting and direction  ( or at least music !  )  .  however ,  for the achievements of walt whitman ,  it deserves a 10 .  a previous poster calls the movie cheesy ,  however ,  i think it's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees .  the film makers were apparently more interested in getting the story out there than to have a hollywood shiny feature film .  and for this ,  i applaud them - the fact it is non-mainstream reflects the life of whitman as well .  this film is more documentary than for the sake of acting .  to be fascinated with a story such as this ,  when you rarely hear of these types of stories that shape current day mental health ,  is the most important thing .  i found it a highly enjoyable look at history . 
the wonderful  " z "  channel in los angeles showed this pia zadora film about six months or so after  " butterfly "  .  i had such high hopes for the actress ,  and then she goes from bad to obviously worse in this film .   again ,  it was the 80's and i gotta tell you harold robbin's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers .  jacqueline susann ripped into him  ( she hated his way of writing women )  ,  irwin shaw's work caught on with many women ,  and of course sidney sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came jackie collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books ,  even more so .  which is why this work smelt .  harold robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences .  pia zadora acting in one of robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire .  the supporting cast was not a help either .   oooooh .  .  .  this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later ,  it looks even worse .  i had a hope for pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done .  it would be tough for pia to redeem herself as an actress  ( although john waters casting her in  " hairspray "  was a spark )  although she has a nice singing voice .   hey ,  pia ,  wherever you are .  .  . hairspray may go on tour !  join the show .  you may be the biggest comeback story yet .   i just hope they burn this film for ya if you do . 
in fact ,  these young people were so distasteful that i couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered ,  and that includes clarissa  ( joanna canton )  since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch .   but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background .  it had nowhere to go but down .   even the prosthetics looked fake and the  " blood "  looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch ,  although later on it took on red day-glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing .  i'm sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t since it'll appeal to that bunch .  it sure didn't appeal to me .  blah .  .  .   and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself .  she still looks hot ,  though .  i'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays .   however ,  it is a step up from dante tomaselli's meandering horror  ( 2002 )  in that it has a somewhat coherent plot ,  so i'll give it that much .  that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch .  i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end .  it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film .   lion's gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up .   2 out of 10
i waited almost 25 years to see this movie ,  thinking it might be an underrated work ,  from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been .  it starred one of the best film villains of all time ,  was based on a beloved series of children's books ,  and was a disney studios production .  what could possibly be wrong with it ?  as it turns outs ,  almost everything .   well ,  not everything .  vincent price as rattigan and henry mancini's swanky score are the movie's two saving graces .  price is wickedly enjoyable ,  and mancini more professional than the material deserves .  they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity .    meanwhile the rest of the movie ,  while filled with inappropriately adult situations ,  still suffers from a completely dull script ,  blandly generic voice work ,  terrible songs ,  and lazy animation that wouldn't have been out of place on any of disney's mid-1980s saturday morning tv shows .   this was a complete disappointment to me .  it's amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh .  costing a fraction of this ,  an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running time .   the extra star that keeps this from being  " awful "  goes to price and mancini . 
eric clapton ,  jack bruce and ginger baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called  " cream .  "  those were the psychedelic days of england and america and these guys looked it :  all skinny ,  very long hair ,  wild clothes and loud music .  they played a combination of rock and blues and it was ,  for the most part ,  good stuff .   well ,  these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us .  i was always extremely familiar with clapton ,  of course ,  who has never been out of the limelight ,  but i didn't know what to expect from bruce and baker ,  neither of whom i hadn't seen in decades .  they surprised me .  when he was young ,  baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death .  now he looks healthy ,  in shape and his drum playing was solid .  bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great ,  as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs .  this is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing .   some people criticized this show for being low-key .  i don't agree with that .  i have no complaints .  the concert sounded very good .  the second song ,   " spoonful ,  "  was outstanding ,  the highlight of the concert for me .   highly recommended . 
i used to watch this show as a child ,  and i loved it !  i watched it when it came on toonami years ago .  .  .  . sheesh ,  i sound so old !  i must've been 13 or 14 when it came on .  .  . but anyways ,  it had a great plot line ,  and i'm one of those girlie-girls who watched  ( and adored )  sailormoon ,  and i enjoyed it very much .  the animation wasn't the best .  .  .  . quite amusing in some parts ,  actually ,  and the voice acting was extremely lame in the beginning ,  but it was all a good watch ,  and i found myself sucked into it day after day .   samurai troopers/ronin warriors is a classic ,  and an all-time one of my faves .  go ryo !  !  !  ! 
 " winchester '73 "  marked the first of a series of westerns involving james stewart and director anthony mann .  as in most of them stewart's hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time .    the title refers to a  " one in a thousand "  rifle that is up for competition at a rifle shoot held in dodge city on july 4 ,  1876 .  into town comes lin mcadam  ( stewart )  and his sidekick high spade  ( millard mitchell )  who are on the trail of dutch henry brown  ( stephen mcnally )  for a past dastardly deed .  they arrive just in time to see marshal wyatt earp  ( will geer )  running saloon girl lola  ( shelley winters )  out of town .  it turns out that dutch henry is also in town for the rifle shoot .  lin and dutch henry shoot it out for the coveted prize with lin winning but dutch henry robs lin of the gun and escapes .    lin and high spade trail dutch henry across country where they encounter lola with her cowardly beau steve miller  ( charles drake )  hold up in a u . s .  cavalry camp awaiting attack by the indians led by young bull  ( rock hudson )  who has acquired the prized rifle by murdering wily gun runner john mcintyre .  he had got the weapon by cheating dutch henry at poker .  young bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to steve .    meanwhile ,  back at the ranch ,  lola and steve meet up with notorious gunman waco johnny dean  ( dan duryea )  who kills steve and takes the valued rifle and lola for himself .  when dean meets up with dutch henry ,  he allows him to take back  " his gun "  planning to murder him later .  in the town of tuscosa ,  lin kills dean as dutch henry's plans of holding up the bank go bad and he escapes into the hills with lin in pursuit .  in one of the best final shoot outs ever ,  the two meet in the final showdown .    i believe that this movie was the only one of the stewart/mann collaborations that was shot in b&w .  it is beautifully photographed ,  especially the scenes in the  " wide open spaces "  and in particular ,  the final showdown .  stewart playing against type ,  plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge ,  an emotion that he would carry into future films with mann .    as in most universal westerns ,  this one boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day .  in addition to those mentioned above ,  j . c .  flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant ,  steve brodie ,  james millican ,  john doucette and chuck roberson as various henchmen ,  ray teal as the sheriff pursuing duryea ,  tony curtis and james best as rookie soldiers and edmund cobb ,  chief yowlachie and john war eagle in various roles in the dodge city sequence .    a classic western in every sense of the word .  it was responsible for re-generating stewart's career as an action star . 
don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic .  this movie was shot in a lower budget  , probably against the will of ernest marishka ,  so he had to make due . for example england is portrayed as bordering on germany . by a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alone . they arrived their too quick .  this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented ,  for the movie ,  was austrian .  when she's told that she's queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her ,  where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen ?  why isbn't she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects  ? low budget ! where the audience back then aware of these imperfection ?  i wonder how the critics felt ? durring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbn't excited about it .  durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like  "  my old kentucky home "   ,  and  " old black joe "  .  what ?  civil war songs in the 1830's ?  is romy schneider being portrayed as scarlet ? where's mammy ?  is magna shnieder playing her too ?  is adrian hoven rhett or ashley ?  what was in marishka mind ? well this add to the camp . it's unintentionally satirizing queen victoria'a story .  this is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction germany and england are connected
the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it .  but it is so subtle you don't know how to read it !  are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on .  the little dialogue the film has isn't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film .  if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn't take anything away from the film .  the physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story .   i is a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame .  i first say this film as part of a  " black "  film festival .  after watching the film i was so impressed by the work .  but then i asked myself what next ?  where can someone else see this work ?  the common association of art without purpose isn't to be found here .  you can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish .  the usage of african music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason .  the character development is amazing .  the casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film ;  the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film .   we need to see more of these kinds of films ,  there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board . 
what the *bliep* is it with this movie ?  couldn't they fiend a better script ?  all in all a 'nice' movie ,  but .  .  .  it has been done more than once .  .  .  up till the end i thought it was okay ,  but .  .  .  the going back to the past part .  .  .  *barf* so corny .  .  .  was waiting for the fairy god mother to appear .  .  .  but wow ,  that didn't happen .  .  .  which is good .   i loved big with tom hanks ,  but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who wished that he/she is older/bigger ;  that just is so pasé  just watch till it comes out on tv .  don't get me wrong ,  but it ain't all that
for months i've been hearing about this little movie and now i've seen it .  i find it cute ,  cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie .  troops ,  swingblade ,  any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind .  if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films .  how many times have you heard the phrase ,   " it's animal house meets back to the future "  ;   " it's wall street meets dead poet's society "  ;  or  " shakespeare in love meets star wars "  ?  i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable . 
madhur bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today .   celebrities party endlessly ,  they like to be seen at these parties ,  and to get due exposure in the media .  in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this .  imo there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a  " i need you ,  you need me "  kind of relationship .  however ,  the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa .  anyhow ,  in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column  ( page 3 of the newspaper )  reporter konkana sen sharma .  she is shown as this celebrity maker ,  very popular at the social gatherings .  she has a good friend in the gay abhijeet and in the struggling model rohit  ( bikram saluja )  .  she rooms with an air-hostess  the sassy pearl  ( sandhya mridul )  ,  and a struggling actress - gayatri  ( tara sharma )  .  the editor of the newspaper is boman irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by atul kulkarni .  the movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level .  the rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part ,  the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios ,  exploitation of power ,  hunger for media exposure .  into all this is layered in homosexuality ,  a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot ,  rampant drug use ,  pedophilia ,  police  " encounter "  deaths .  in light of all this pearl's desire to have a super rich husband ,  a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car ,  the bitching women ,  all seem benign ills .   the film has absolutely excellent acting by konkana sen sharma ,  atul kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion .  but the supporting cast is more than competent  ( boman irani is very good )  .  this is what saves the film for me .  mr .  bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash .  i wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively .  he berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful .  we have an item number in the framework of a bollywood theme party ,  the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a western beat .  i hope the next one from madhur bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the hindi film stereotyped ingredients .  the film is a brave  ( albeit flawed )  effort ,  certainly worth a watch . 
the film had many fundamental values of family and love .  it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story .  the script was clear (  it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children ) and was enjoyable and humorous at times .  there were a few charged symbols to look for .  the cinematography was acceptable .  there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today ( which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out )  .  it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it .  although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy .  and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didn't like either but in all it was a good movie . 
i was to young to ever know much about prince but in the past few years i've seen a lot of purple rain novelty tee's and i thought they were cool but i didn't want to buy a shirt i knew nothing about .  so one saturday it came on fuse and i decided to watch it .  i didn't know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out .  in the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as  " the kid "  .  all the performances where great to me but my favorite were purple rain ,  darling nicki ,  and i would die for you .  all the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when doves cried described what he was feeling .  i also like how clever prince was with the way he flirted with apallonia .  i liked when prince and appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her standing and then once she turned around he disappeared !  great movie and now i cant even find one of those tee shirts  :  ( 
what can i say ,  it's a damn good movie .  see it if you still haven't .  great camera works and lighting techniques .  awesome ,  just awesome .  orson welles is incredible 'the lady from shanghai' can certainly take the place of 'citizen kane' . 
the film portrays france's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in western  ( francophone )  africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman ,  france  ( herein symbolically representing her nation )  .  it is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past ,  in particular ,  and a nation's desire to reach out to the 'other' it once 'owned' and moulded .  this is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling  ( or being in transit )  from the present to the past ;  remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities .   the characters all play a symbolic ,  albeit a limited and unconvincing role .  france ,  meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary french society ,  leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a child-in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality .  the rest of the rag-tag ensemble is just forgettable .  the black africans are ,  to say the least ,  offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material .  they are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe-like france wonders seeking a world she never knew ,  and hoping for one that can never be found in cameroon . 
the russian movie ,   " 4 ,  "  follows the lives of three  ( not four )  strangers who meet one night in a local bar .  one is a musician ,  one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl .    " 4 ,  "  i gather ,  is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-soviet russia  ( the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are )  ,  but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it .  there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities ,  selling decades-old frozen meat etc .  - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody's really up to here .   despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes ,   " 4 "  is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs . 
contains spoilers !   i saw an advert for this on a video . then my sister discovered that we had the book so i read it . i rented the video on the same day i finished the book . i thought it was very memorable as was the book .  the cast was brilliant . tara fitzgerald was excellent as helen and rupert graves was hateful as arthur . the costumes , music and settings are stunningly beautiful .   warning ! don`t read any more if you haven`t watched this  on the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added in and some violence . this is why the video is rated 15 .  there are some other things that have been thrown in . after the first part , i felt that the accuracy went downhill .  while the book is better than this , i am glad i have seen it and would reccomend it to people who have read the book , are fans of bronte or like costume dramas ( i am all 3 !  ) as long as you fastforward through the sex scenes .  the book is rather underated . anne brontes books don`t seem to be that widely read or well known as jane erye or wuthering heights which have made it into television and film several times .  another thing . when i read the book  , i was surprised at how much religion ther was in it , but here they had axed that all out !   7\10
i think it's a great movie !  !  it's fun ,  maybe a little unrealistic ,  but fun and dramatic !  !  i would like to see it again ,  if they were showing it in tv !  !  just 1 question :  are we still talking about the same movie ?  ?  ? 
this is the best mob film ever made .  it deserved more then what it got at the oscars .  nominated for things like its score ,  art direction ,  supporting role  ( newman )  ,  this film could have easily been nominated for best picture ,  director  ( mendes )  ,  actor  ( hanks )  ,  supporting actor  ( newman and law )  and won !  !  hanks gives one of his best performances ,  and the kid who played michel jr .  was so good that i'm surprised i don't see him in more movies today .  critics themselves didn't give this film enough credit .  but besides the incredible performances ,  another real star of this film is the incredible music .  this was by far the best score of the year .  it was nominated but didn't win .  this is a great film that should be seen by everyone .  my grade-a+
 .  .  .  mainly because ju-on 2 boasts an outrageous forty minutes' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes ,  that leaves you with 36 original minutes' worth of film .  ho-hum .  i found that deeply irritating - as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff !  - not to mention dull ,  having to watch it all over again .   ok ,  that complaint aside ,  the byline for ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie ,  which frankly ,  over 36 minutes ,  simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline .   there are ,  however ,  some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been ,  had it had some time to develop ;  and some of the questions raised by the original - some ,  but not all - are answered .   so in conclusion - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story ,  go for it - but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast-forward button for forty minutes . 
what a disappointment .  .  .  admittedly the best of the prequels ,  but the story is weak ,  the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces ,  poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly .  there are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films ,  and the emergence of darth vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years .  i won't complain about the abysmal dialogue ,  as this is star wars .  .  .  the original three films had style ,  cult feeling and cracking stories ,  and the strange dialogue added charm .  the prequels were shallow attempts to make more money ,  and this lack of love shows in spades .  utterly disappointing . 
i enjoyed this show for two reasons 1 .  richard dean anderson 2 .  amanda tapping .  these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors .  the replacement of rda in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show .   the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous .  you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling .  this relationship carries over into the program we get to see .   rda gives his 'o'neill' character believable personality .  he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest .  you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances .  still ,  they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous .   there is a lot going on between 'carter' and 'o'neill' under the surface .  they manage to keep the lid on ,  but often just barely .  the episode 'solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television .  the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together .   'carter' and 'jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'o'neill' .  yet 'o'neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound .  he understands what to do without having to think about the matter .  the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders .   the quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10 .  the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest .  ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show .  he had his rare moments with claudia black ,  but that was all .  amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons .  you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby .  she was probably thinking more about the child than the show .   the spin-off 'stargate atlantis' has a few moments ,  but is mostly a weaker effort .  the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original .  the villains  ( wraiths )  are so improbable as to be ludicrous .  maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season .   there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show .  to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci-fi .  the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad .  the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept .   i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too .  in the season 2 opener ,  'daniel jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded .  he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet .  the episode 'hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc ,  yet it is never mentioned again .  this device could have been used in several later episodes on 'daniel' ,  'o'neill' ,  and 'dr .  frasier' . 
it was a good story ,  but not very well told .  i liked the themes and the main story line ,  which wasn't as clear as it could have been .  maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in .  the acting was okay to cheesy ,  some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting .  it took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad .  i only just finished watching it and i'm glad i did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end .  again ,  a good story ,  but the delivery was sub par .  would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy ,  and i do mean ,  a little . 
until today i had never seen this film .  its was filmed on the sets of the old dark house and frankenstein and concerns a small bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers .   frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that won't quit ,  lionel atwill ,  dwight frye ,  faye wray and melvin douglas playing a character named brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmother's maiden name .   this is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time ,  only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up .  from that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it .   leonard maltin and imdb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints .  the trouble is that imdb and maltin can be wrong ,  and in this case i think they are since a source i trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes  ( the overlook film encyclopedia )  quibbling about this i know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long .  personally i think it won't matter that much since its at most five minutes and i doubt very much it will make or break the film .   what ever the running time  ,  if you like creaky old films ,  do ,  by all means do ,  watch this movie ,  its a great dark and stormy night film . 
from the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work  ( richard widmark )  stealing from a woman's purse  ( jean peters )  ,  pickup on south street is relentlessly fascinating to watch .  partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast ,  the b&w photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters ,  and because samuel fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like john  ( asphalt jungle )  huston .  in fact ,  it has the same urgency as the huston film about a heist that goes wrong--but the payoff is not quite as strong .   jean peters is excellent as the hard-edged girl whom widmark describes as being  " knocked around a lot "  .  she gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro-film in her purse for her boyfriend  ( richard kiley )  ,  something the fbi already knows about .  they're on her trail when the theft occurs .   thelma ritter adds realism to her portrait of a woman called  " moe "  who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life .  she's particularly touching in her final scene with kiley .   this one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time .  good noir from fox and notable for the performances of widmark ,  peters and ritter . 
i'm sorry ,  but even tj hooker's adrian zmed couldn't save this sequel .  i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original .  then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene  ( notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs )  ;  and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious .  i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang ,  having lost their  " wheels "  due to their gambling habits in the original grease ,  were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie .  being shamed by that putz character carrington ,  i'd hate to see what they would resort to later :  maybe mopeds ?   i also never bought the hackneyed theme :  hunky-australian-boy-can't-fit-into-outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for -tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look .  it was disney story gone horribly awry .   so ,  it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble-gum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical .  the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it . 
i would not consider myself as one of leonard cohen's greatest fans .  he does however feature as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage .  by far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear leonard's reflections on his own life and career .  warming and humble .    unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didn't converse the nuances of leonard's musical / literary manner .  nick cave ,  jarvis cocker & beth orton were the exceptions ,  even though leonard highly values rufus wainrights interpretations of his songs .   what particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who leonard cohen is and how these musicians connect to him .  a lot is said in this respect ,  but the viewer is not drawn into the person leonard cohen .  this failing is especially evident with the interviews with bono and the edge .  they view leonard as a special icon ,  but can't translate their exact value of leonard cohen .  the collaboration with u2 is a farce .  the entire live registration looks like a rushed job .  and just as in the whole film ,  only leonard cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part .   the entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project .  the use of effects such as echo ,  slow-motion or flashed images are ill placed .  some of the camera-work is dismal .  part of the score hardly recalls any associations i may have expected .  at times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film .  perhaps a reference to his once use of lsd .   some unintentional humor  .  .  .  at some point leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre .  initially he can't recall the genre's name ,  until eventually he says it was punk ,  the punksters really picked up on his music .  the next scene in the film is a live cover of 'i can't forget'  .  .  .    " and i can't forget ,  i can't forget i can't forget but i don't remember who " 
if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic ,  it might  ( i say might )  have been a hit .  have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults ?  well this is it .  every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards .  it would be hard to find another film ,  with this kind of production budget ,  that contains so little of any value whatsoever .  the whole thing ,  from the opening scenes defies logic .  dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical .  ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself .  what is really mind boggling ,  is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash .  wow . 
another reason to watch this delightful movie is florence rice .  florence who ?  that was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen .  i soon found out who florence rice was ,  a real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance .  as they all do in this gripping ensemble piece .  from 1939 ,  its a different time but therein lies the charm .  it transports you into another world .  it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious .  florence rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine .  she is absolutely delightful ,  at the same time strong ,  vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman . watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie .  she made over forty movies ,  and i am going to seek out the other thirty nine .  alan marshal is of the flynn/gable mode and proves a perfect match for florence .  buddy ebsen and una merkel provide some excellent comic moments ,  but the real star is florence rice .  fans of 30's/40's movies ,  don't miss this one ! 
in 1942 a film tales of manhattan told a set of stories that were basically unrelated ,  but tied together with a suit of men's evening wear .  each story began when the  " tails "  were passed from one owner  ( charles boyer ,  for instance )  to another  ( ceasar romero )  .  winchester '73 ,  a superior film ,  and a great western ,  has a similar plot twist .  initially it is about how jimmy stewart is seeking stephen  ( horace )  macmahon for some deadly grudge .  but in the course of the film the two men get into a shooting contest ,  the prize  ( given by marshall wyatt earp - will geer )  being one of the new winchester rifles .  stewart barely beats out macmahon ,  but the gun is stolen from stewart ,  and the chase is on .    the gun passes from hand to hand ,  including john mcintyre  ( as an arrogant trader who fatally does not know when to stop being arrogant )  ,  to rock hudson  ( in a surprising role - and a brief one at that )  ,  to charles drake ,  to dan duryea  ( as the delightfully deadly and psychotic waco johnny dean )  ,  to macmahon .  eventually it does return to stewart .   the film is expertly directed by anthony mann .  every character has a wide variety of experiences .  duryea gets the rifle literally over drake's dead body  ( duryea forces the issue )  .  but he loses it to macmahon ,  who is faster on the draw - not that duryea is stupid enough to fight for the rifle .  as he and shelley winter look at macmahon in the distance ,  winter  ( who watched duryea kill her former boy friend drake )  drops her distaste for the gunman momentarily to ask why he put up with macmahon's bullying for the gun .  philosophically ,  duryea explains he can wait .  some opportunity will come up later on  ( i . e .  ,  when he can safely kill macmahon and get back the rifle )  .    the characters are remarkably human .  winters first appears as the future bride of drake ,  but she sees a really big negative side to him - an unforgivable side .  drake is aware of this lapse ,  and it helps lead to his destruction .  other characters have realistic touches ,  such as j . c .  flippen as an army sergeant who fights an indian attack with steward and steward's friend millard mitchell .  oh yes ,  and with flippen's fellow soldier - tony curtis .  flippen makes one believe this soldier has been on a hundred battlefields before ,  since 1861 probably .  steward had showed emotions in other films .  in it's a wonderful life he showed a degree of anger at times ,  and also a near nervous breakdown when he thinks everything is wrong with his life .  but here he showed a demonic anger - at the expense of a surprised duryea  ( who normally would show such anger himself )  .   the parts of this film fit very neatly together ,  under mann's competent hands .  this is one western that never wears out ,  as the audience watches the travels of a winchester rifle . 
this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they're thoughts are .  i don't know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit .  it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities . put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out .  for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice-over for the first has been removed .  only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder , proving that , after all , animals are more interesting than people
i know this sounds odd coming from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped airing ,  but i love this show .  i don't know why ,  but i enjoy watching it .  i love adam the best .  the only disappointing thing is that the only place i found to buy the seasons on dvd was in germany ,  and that was only the first two seasons .  that is disappointing ,  but that's ok .  i'll keep looking online .  if anyone has any tips on where to buy the second through 14th seasons ,  please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo . com .  i already own the first one .  the only down side is that the dvds being from germany ,  they only play on my portable dvd player and my computer .  oh well .  i still own it ! 
terminus paradis was exceptional ,  but  " niki ardelean "  comes too late .  we already have enough of this and we want something new .   big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time ,  not behind .  why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country ?   we are just born not reincarnated ,  and nobody gives a s**t anymore about old times .  most people dont remember or dont want to remember ,  and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit .  this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi !  maybe younger directors should make the move . 
tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death .  when he survives electrocution the government officials give him a choice to either be electrocute at a greater degree or agree to some experiments .  he chooses the experimentation and is placed in a large metallic cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution .  they can have whatever the want in the room  ( within reason )  ,  but they can't leave .  after a few days there meals are cut down to one per day and the room temp is set up too 100 .  after some more alarms are sounded at intervals so they can't sleep .  one day a 'witch' come into their cell  ( albeit a glassed off portion )  what happens next i'll let you find out .  i may be in the minority here but i liked the build up ,  it was intriguing to me .  now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was i would have rated this so much higher .   my grade :  c+   media blaster's 2 dvd set extras :  disc 1 )  director's cut ;  trailers for  " versus "  ,   " aragami "  ,   " attack the gas station "  ,  and  " deadly outlaw rekka "  disc 2 )  theatrical cut ;  commentary with hideo sakaki ,  ryuhei kitamura ,  sakaguchi takuand tsutomu takahashi ;  cast and crew interview ;  making of ;  original trailer ;  and promo teasers
despite louis b .  mayer reportedly not being interested in signing the young greta garbo to a contract ,  this first american and mgm film for the actress looked quite beautiful .  it's obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make matte paintings ,  as it has all the nice polish and artfulness you'd expect from the best pictures the studio could produce .  it simply looks beautiful--even 84 years later .   as for garbo herself ,  like her other very early american films she ,  too ,  looks different .  while she's quite recognizable ,  her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year later--giving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just didn't see in subsequent films .  i kind of wish they'd kept this look ,  but considering how famous she'd become with the trademark look ,  who am i to say they shouldn't have gone that route ?  !  the film is about garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord .  while the landlady ,  the much esteemed doña bernarda ,  claims it's because the bank has demanded payment ,  it's because her son has fallen for garbo--and what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets !  nice lady ,  huh ?  !  years pass and by now garbo has become a new singing sensation who is world-famous .  when she returns to her hometown years later ,  her old boyfriend  ( who had promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother ,  doña bernarda ,  refused to allow it )  sees her .  his new love for another lady is now tested--will he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame ?  and ,  more importantly ,  will garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly ?  in the meantime ,  a huge rainstorm hits .  the land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge .  cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks !  in a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream ,  he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where garbo is now staying .  she welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes .  then ,  he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe .  she tells him to get lost !  next ,  you see ricardo about to get married to his second choice ,  the daughter of the pork king .  he obviously has little enthusiasm for this--and you feel sorry for the lady ,  as she did nothing wrong .  soon ,  cortez is seen wandering back to garbo's home--he's love-sick and needs her .  in this scene ,  garbo is quite luminous and can't tell him to leave--as they dissolve in each other's arms .  once again ,  he tells her of his love for her .   when doña bernarda learns of this ,  she is not pleased .  evidently ,  a pork queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer .  because of the meddling of this nasty old lady ,  garbo leaves--unwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son .  but ,  cortez comes running--announcing he must have her and won't rest until he has her as his wife .  moments after making this proclamation ,  a family friend talks to cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation .  so much for  " won't rest until he has her for his wife "  ,  huh ?  !  despite cortez being a wimp through and through ,  for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him .  and so ,  he marries the pork queen and lives a very dull life .  when years later garbo meets cortez again ,  he is a dull looking middle-aged man--while she is as beautiful as ever .  and ,  not surprisingly ,  she tells him ,  once again ,  to get lost .   at the time this film was made ,  garbo was not a star in the us and cortez was .  so ,  in light of this ,  it's surprising they gave cortez such an unlikable character to play .  instead of the usual confident valentino-like role they'd been giving him ,  here he is an indecisive wimp--a huge wimp .  and ,  from here on ,  his career was on a slow downward spiral .  as for garbo ,  the role helped establish her as a big star--as she was the focus of the film and played a character much like her later personas .   as for the film ,  the new music composed for it was very nice ,  though a tad repetitive .  the print ,  oddly ,  was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cards--which could use some restoration .   a most enjoyable film--expertly constructed ,  wistful and worth seeing .  and ,  for one of the few times i can think of it ,  i have no real complaints in this excellent film . 
wow what can i say .  i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick ,  but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance  . lorenzo lamas ,  pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control .  it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse .  crazed hillbilles yep !  needless tit shot  ( with a real weird scar )  yep !  crappy soundtrack yep !  i wish i could give the movie -10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes .  seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real .  .  .  .  .  .  the worse thing there is 2more snake eater movies !  .  .  .  .  .  .  guess its in demand . 
thoughtless ,  ignorant ,  ill-conceived ,  career-killing  ( where is the talented angela jones now ?  )  ,  deeply unfunny garbage .  it's no wonder reb braddock hasn't directed anything else since - anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules ,  based on his own script ,  with the help of quentin tarantino himself ,  and creates something like this ,  anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world ,  doesn't deserve a second break .  under the circumstances ,  the performances are good - the actors do what they're told to do ,  and they do it well .  it's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place .    0 out of 4 . 
allow me to just get to the bottom line here :  i've got 3 kids ,  ages 5 to 10 .  i consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals .  i've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times .  i can tell you when the film gets reversed in the wizard of oz ,  the over-18 sexual joke in el dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of rudolph the red-nosed reindeer .  i could probably storyboard nemo from memory alone .   what makes me support the one child of mine  ( it varies )  who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening ?  in a word :  showerman .   moment of silence .  .  .   *sigh*
i don't know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business !  this movie  ( short )  is gross  ( to say the least )  !  it is a bunch of 5-7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins ,  acting like adults  ( and too much so !  )  .  however ,  it is interesting because it is a good example of how  " the good old days "  may not have been so good after all !   ( thank god we have laws against this kind of material now !  )   {this is one short from the  " shirley temple festival " }
i've never been a huge fan of mormon films .  being a mormon ,  i've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos .  i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air ,  the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non-mormon friends .   boy ,  was i wrong .   i figured ,  since this had b-list talent like clint howard ,  gary coleman ,  andrew wilson ,  and fred willard  ( one of my favorites )  ,  this would have to be at least a little funny .  and besides ,  church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such .  but i must say ,  throughout the entire movie ,  it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing .  every joke fell flat ,  and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored .  the dialogue was bland ,  and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen .  every single character but wilson's was less than one-dimensional .  it's hard to believe that after nine re-writes the film was still as mind-numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed .  i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this .  my friends and i were extras in the final game scene ,  so we went to the premiere in washington city ,  ut .  kurt hale ,  the director ,  was there ,  and i must say ,  i avoided all contact with him after the show .  he waited at the door ,  seemingly ready for feedback .  i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life ,  but it left a nasty ,  painful scar that i will never forget .   here are a few specific problems i had :  there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player ,  but these two characters came out of nowhere ,  and were impossible to care about ,  so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame ,  uninteresting characters .  there were many subplots that popped up every now and then ,  each promising the audience the chance for laughs ,  but each one came and went in a puff of smoke ,  ending before you could even start caring .  this was pretty much how the whole movie felt .   this film was a major letdown ,  and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie .  true ,  the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to mormons .  then again ,  it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears .   please ,  do not see this movie .  keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious .  spare yourself the disappointment i went through
i really enjoyed this debut by ring director ,  hideo nakata .  if you've seen ring beforehand then you'll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick .  it's got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant  ( and predictable )  stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre .  if you like films that give you the chills ,  then you will probably like this one .  a good ,  creepy debut by hideo nakata .  8/10
this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10 .  .  for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no  " good plot "  or anything like that ,  thats ridiculous ,  saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot !  you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes ,  for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that ,  if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time .  porn is watched for the porn ,  jackie chan is watched for the action ,  i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained .  sure the middle of the movie was boring ,  very boring ,  but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that .  this did change the way how american action movies were created ,  they have even stollen scenes from this movie .  if you want a true man ,  a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan's ,  hes pure in everyway .  he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park ,  and even in todays movies .  american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more .  police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do .  a masterpiece
many reviews i've read reveals that most people tend to like part one better than part two .  i feel exactly the opposite .  part one played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing che guevara's personality through different types of film stock ,  different locations ,  and cutting back and forth between an interview and the cuban revolution .  for the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting .  in part two ,  che enters bolivia ,  and along with changing geographical location ,  the rules and the structure changes .  gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks ,  the  " documentary realism "  and the treatises .  instead ,  now we are literally trapped with che in a desaturated ,  depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option .  i posit that it's the dark turn of che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer part one to part two .   the change in geographic location also signifies ,  for me at least ,  that che :  part one and che :  part two are ,  in fact ,  the second two acts of a three act structure begun by motorcycle diaries .  motorcycle diaries is che's coming-of-age  ( or more appropriately ,  coming-of-ideals )  in argentina ,  che :  part one is his military leadership in cuba ,  and che :  part two is his downfall in bolivia .  these movies do not completely illustrate his life  ( we're missing his experiences in guatamala and ,  more importantly in my opinion ,  his post-cuban revolution executions )  ,  but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol .  he both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression ,  and revolutionary failings in the post-world war ii third world countries and their hindering by such activities as ,  um ,  the cias meddling .   but ,  yet again ,  all of that is projected on-screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches ,  but through a much more intimate ,  suffering portrayal of che at the end of his thread and his life .  again ,  the rules have changed ,  and in this case it's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all .  the number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated ,  shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape ,  an existential hell ,  where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death .  it's just not that easy of a movie to watch ,  but it's very effective .   --polarisdib
this oddity in the new doris day collection doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes .  what she does do however ,  is shine when she's on screen .  the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day .  jancie rule shows promise and it's a shame she didn't become a big star .  ruth roman handles the role of the  " go-getter "  with aplomb .  better if this was in color .  the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well .  what's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes .  if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you'll like this one . 
i discovered this movie on ifc ,  and i thought it would be interesting .  for  " tiny "  love stories ,  some of the stories really dragged on in this movie .  the fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives ,  including kathy baker and alicia witt .  i have to admit ,  i want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again ,  like in  " strike !  ( 1998 )  ,  "  when odette sinclair's acquaintances started asking about her presumed first time ,  and tweety asked  " was it beautiful ?  "   some might think re-enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie .  i think it would make things even worse .  it doesn't necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention ,  but somehow i just expected more . 
this film has ,  over the past ten years ,  become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences .  the three storyline threads given us by kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures .  the domestic chitchat between bel geddes and widmark ,  the movement between rooms ,  the small gestures such as the phone book barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table ,  those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife ,  all are well crafted and natural .  more than anything else ,  i love their porch ,  that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time .  the second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between widmark and douglas' characters .  it may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all ,  it comes across as real ,  respectful and efficient .  the third thread , the grungy tale of blackie and his tattered little gang ,  gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world . palance's blackie is as cold as a block of ice .  this self-proclaimed business man ,  this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to .  for me ,  this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience . 
this is an hybrid creature born at carl macek mind .  with robotech the second generation  ( robotech masters )  and megazone 23 into one miserable movie ,  that have no logic !  the story is very ,  very bad ,  and you cannot forgive the action of megazone when have nothing to do with robotech .  if this movie have so high rank is for the tv series and not for itself !  !  i did said it ,  the name cannot save this ! 
emory is a cincinatti steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin pillars of his family's existence have been the steel mill and the union .  the mill ,  which once employed 45 , 000 ,  has seen its numbers dwindle to 5 , 000 recently and now 1 ,  as the plant just shut its doors ,  leaving a single security guard .  at first ,  newly-unemployed emory and his pals enjoy their independence ,  hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar ,  where they down  " depth charges "  with reckless abandon .  they think the mill will reopen after listening to their union rep's optimistic spiel ,  but reality starts to sink in when they find themselves selling their personal vehicles in a struggle to put food on the table and stave off foreclosure of their homes .  emory's father - a dedicated union man - is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short-lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill .  meanwhile ,  some of the unemployed men take demeaning make-work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment .    finally the union admits its helplessness ,  as emory explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill won't ever open again .  emory tearfully asks  " what did i do wrong ?  "  as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job ,  union ,  church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn .  he hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor .  tossed out of his own home and stinging from the plant manager's comments that he and his men didn't work hard enough to justify their substantial paychecks ,  emory recruits the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of .  early in the morning they break into the mill ,  fire up the furnaces and work harder than they ever have in their lives ,  producing in one shift enough high-quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from wall to wall ,  top to bottom - something the plant manager thought was impossible .    arriving at the suddenly-reopened plant ,  the stupefied manager looks around him at the tremendous output that came from a single day's work ,  realizing that production like this could make the plant profitable again .  the manager asks emory :   " can you do this every day ?  "  emory is forced to nod  " no "  and the manager asks :   " then what were you trying to prove ?  "  emory explains that the workers' decades of hard work ,  honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day  " we just spit in your eye .  "  emory bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south ,  promising to relocate the family when he finds it .    this is a powerful and honest treatment of the plight of american workers displaced by foreign competition and gives a realistic view of the costs they bear for the short-sightedness of concession-demanding unions and greedy plant owners who extracted every penny they could from their factories but never gave back by modernizing them .  peter strauss as emory ,  john goodman as his best friend ,  gary cole as his college-boy brother ,  pamela reed as emory's sympathetic wife and john doucette as his dying father all turn in excellent performances in this fine picture . 
it's very very funny .  you know ,  just like a comedy is supposed to be .  it also looks very very good ,  like a hollywood spectacular should .  so ,  what more do you want ?  howz about a very very good sally fields .  she is so much better here than in anything else i've ever seen her in ,  and she looks so damn good .  this movie is all you need to understand why she's a star .  those eyes !  like a silent movie star ,  but better .  in fact ,  everyone's eyes are so good .  i used to pretend to be a bad tv soap actor with my girlfriend .  we'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner .  they don't do that at all in soap dish .  great .  the eyes have it !   ( sorry )    there's so many terrific performances ,  its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear .  there's a whole workshop going on with kevin kline on how to overact very very subtly .  got that ?  yeah ,  he's damn good .  so is robert downey ,  jr .  who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the slick ,  slimy executive .  cathy moriarity ,  while not the most gifted actress ,  is so charismatic and riveting ,  especially when she's angry .  and even whoopi goldberg is decent ,  her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little zing .  ok ,  no whoopi bashing ,  i hear ya .   and then ,  there's the hair .  soap dish was made at the end of the big hair eighties ,  so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves .  they get bigger and sillier ,  just like your's did .  yeah ,  we got pictures .   soap dish is better than i thought it'd be ,  better that i wanted it to be .  i'm sick of movies that tell me i'm supposed to care about shallow ,  self centered ,  semi-talented egomaniacs ,  ie .  tv soap actors .  soap dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em .  thank you . 
this two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned .  sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films ,  but what tv shows don't do that these days .  what we got here was a cracking good sci-fi story .  a great big  ( really scary )  monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit ,  some superb aliens in the ood - the best  " new "  aliens the revived series has come up with ,  a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters  ( complete with a couple of unnamed  " expendable "  security people in true star trek fashion )  ,  some large-scale philosophical themes  ( love ,  loyalty ,  faith ,  etc .  )  ,  and some top-drawer special effects .   i loved every minute of this . 
this is an absurdist dark comedy from belgium .  shot perfectly in crisp black and white ,  benoît poelvoorde  ( man bites dog )  is on fine form as roger ,  the angry ,  obsessive father of a family in a small ,  sullen belgian mining town .  roger is a photographer who ,  along with his young daughter luise ,  visits road accidents to take photos .  he is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record - and he decides that his son ,  michel ,  must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him .  michel dresses as elvis and has a spot on a radio show called 'cinema lies' ,  where he describes mistakes in films .  luise is friendly with near neighbour felix ,  a pigeon fancier .  roger is a callous figure as he pushes michel right over the limit during the record attempt ,  which almost results in his death .  interspersed throughout the film are magritte-like surreal images .  it's undeniably charming and well worth your time . 
melissa sagemiller , wes bentley , eliza dushku and casey affleck play young students at middleton college in the town of middleton . the four teenagers form two love triangles . one night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road . not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed . the ghostly nightmare begins .  .  . pretty lousy and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity . it's obviously influenced by  " carnival of souls "  . the cinematography is decent , unfortunately there is zero suspense . 4 out of 10-just another instantly forgettable teeny-bopper trash . 
in the fiji islands ,  the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the valalola resort primal park invites investors and guests for an opening party of his compound composed of hotel and zoo aiming to find partners for his discoveries .  when a bunch of college smalltime thieves puts a virus in the security system to participate in a scavenger hunt ,  the greatest attractions of the zoo  sabretoothes from the prehistoric age developed from dna found in fossils  escape ,  killing the hosts and guards for pleasure .   the incredibly lame and cheap  " attack of the sabretooth "  is one of the worst movies i have recently seen .  the characters are awful and not funny or pleasant and the story is a terrible jurassik park rip-off with a bad collection of clichés .  basically all the lines and situations are poor and stupid ,  but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabretoothes are bulimic and like to kill for pleasure .  my vote is three .   title  ( brazil )  :   " o ataque do dente de sabre "   (  " the attack of the sabretooth "  ) 
i have seen some pretty bad movies ,  and this is right up there .  no plot to speak of ,  it's like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap-opera .  i just wanted to smack that little girl because ,  well lets just say ,  she's real suspicious all the way through the movie .  the monsters running around wearing some bling was funny .  i also saw a bit of  " silent hill "  in there .  and i read that this was done by ,  and or stared a finnish metal band ,  lordi .  so it's no wonder that it didn't make much sense .  it seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more .  the fx are very good ,  the look of the movie ,  the monsters ,  and even the acting also good .  but the story and the telling of it ,  just aren't there . 
if you made a genre flick in the late 80s ,  you basically had a 50/50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison  ( sadly ,  we never got an underwater prison flick )  .  framed for murder by mafia boss moretti  ( anthony franciosa )  ,  derek keillor  ( dennis cole )  ends up on death row ,  right alongside the mob boss' brother frankie  ( frank sarcinello jr .  )  .  but this is the least of derek's problems as rogue government agent  ( and mob stoolie )  col .  burgess  ( john saxon ,  who also directs )  is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus .  this is the only flick saxon directed during his storied career .  for a guy who has worked with tons of directors ,  it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheap-o italian ones .  sure ,  it is low budget ,  but that can't excuse the stilted staging ,  shooting gaffes ,  or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes .  to his credit ,  saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene  ( our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist )  .  cole ,  who looks like a more rugged jan-michael vincent ,  is decent as the stoic lead and franciosa - sporting a really bad rug - gives it his all as the cliché mob boss .  the end takes place at marty mckee's favorite location ,  bronson canyon .  retromedia released this on dvd as zombie death house . 
apparently hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak .  this movie was mind numbingly bad .  the casting was terrible ,  the acting unspeakable ,  and the story filled with holes .  script ?  who needs script ?  i was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as i thought it would be ,  however i got enough shots of t&a to last me a lifetime .  the movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with add  ( who decided to buy a car instead of go to college )  tell a story .  being so poorly scripted ,  i thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first .  the scenes at the racetrack ,  along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of herbie :  fully loaded .  this is the kind of film is what grindhouse modeled itself after .  .  . only the writers thought they were being serious . 
 .  .  . let me count the ways .   1 .  a title-only 'remake' that pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook .   2 .  a plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic .   3 .  a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills .   4 .  a pg-13 rating that insures no gore ,  violence ,  or sex .   5 .  a villain that is not frightening or even mysterious .   6 .  a cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them .   7 .  a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere  ( much unlike the original prom night )  .   8 .  a script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing .    9 .  a series of cardboard performances  ( not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that )  .   10 .  a completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood .   it's a no-brainer horror fans ,  save your money .   bomb out of ****
where to begin ?  how about with the erroneous synopsis :     " x-men origins :  wolverine tells the story of wolverine's epically violent and romantic past ,  his complex relationship with victor creed ,  and the ominous weapon x program .  "   his epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non-violent .   his relationship with creed is so glossed over it's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all .  we are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run ,  to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan ,  and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins .   there is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all .  nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving .    the romantic element of the movie between silverfox and wolverine was forced and abrupt .  we are thrown into a romance so fast that it's over before you can blink an eye .  having just introduced the character ,  silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later .  we are left wondering why we should care about this .  who was she anyway ?   for a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story ,  the romance is surprisingly unexplored .  it was rushed in simply because it was required .   oddly enough ,  when wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find sabertooth .  being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise .   as for the weapon x program ,  lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure wolverine is up and running .  eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple .  surprisingly ma and pa kent aren't alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn .  is it any wonder what fate awaits them ?   in the previous films and the comic books ,  the main reason that wolverines' amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded .   knowing this was the case .  .  . did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates ?   as hinted to in x2 :  x-men united when stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together .  this film sets up the team fairly well only they don't really do much of anything .  no disturbing violence ,  no ruthless actions ,  they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen .    it seems that wolverine wasn't an evil man under stryker at all .  instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother sabertooth which consequently was the violent agent we all thought wolverine was .  eventually he just leaves all together .   no conflict of duality here at all .   idiotically removing that character conflict of good and evil dulled the story immensely .  they may as well have given him rubber claws .   there were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the x-men trilogy ,  including the introduction of one of the lamest deus ex machinas to ever hit a script .   magic memory-erasing bullets .    really ?   apparently they are the only thing to bring down wolverine .  yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all .   another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all .  interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story .  most were in the film for 5-10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of wolverine .   fred dukes  ( the blob but not the comic version )  can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all ,  but a simple headbutt from wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him ?   cyclops optic beams  ( which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers )  can burn through buildings but when fired at sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes .  adamantium trench coats anyone ?   the  ( gravity defying )  mutant gambit ,  instead of utilizing his signature cards ,  is made into some sort of crazy acrobat .  in one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by wolverine .  .  . then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running towards wolverine .  how he regained consciousness ,  ran away a few blocks ,  climbed up a building ,  then ran back to wolverine and sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained .   some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash .  the idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect .   the comic book source material ,  the real origin of wolverine .  .  . is a story worth bringing to the screen .  it doesn't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless cgi junkies .  it is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time ,  began with weapon x by barry windsor-smith .  a much more intense and exciting story .   this fox film should seriously be forgotten .    anyone have that magic gun ?   4/10
i found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis .  when leo ,  the oldest announces that he is hiv+ the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange .   i have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one ;  nor one as likely to shout at each other .  i didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult i found this a thoroughly moving film .   
i registered for imdb just to comment on this movie .    i just got done sitting through this movie ,  and the only thing that impressed me ,  was that i somehow had the will power to not stop it .   i've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not ,  but princess blade has some of the worst fights i've ever seen in a movie .  most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent isn't doing the same .  i've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots .   so now we have a  " futuristic "  action movie with poor action ,  and virtually no sign of the future .    most of the movie doesn't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the princess and the farmboy/terrorist and his disturbed sister .  the movie has multiple plot lines ,  and none of them really pan out to be worth anything .    part of the problem may have been that i watched the dub ,  which was quite bad .  the entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on .  but i got the general idea .   ( knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes )   if you've heard about this being a futuristic action/ninja flick ,  then you've heard wrong .  thats what i thought it was when i heard about it ,  and now i've lost 90 minutes of my life .  don't let this happen to you .  steer well clear of it . 
although it was released way back in 1967 ,  in cold blood still remains the benchmark by which all true-crime films are matched .  veteran writer/director richard brooks  ( elmer gantry )  adapted truman capote's non-fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today ,  thirty-five years later .   robert blake and scott wilson portray perry smith and dick hickock ,  two ex-cons who ,  on a tip from hicock's old cellmate floyd wells ,  broke into the holcomb ,  kansas home of herbert clutter ,  looking for a wall safe supposedly containing $10 , 000 .  but no safe was ever found ,  and the two men instead wound up killing mr .  clutter ,  his wife ,  and their two children ,  getting away with only a radio ,  a pair of binoculars ,  and a lousy forty dollars .  two months on the run ,  including an aimless  " vacation "  in northern mexico ,  ended in las vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car .  but it eventually comes out ,  after merciless grilling by kansas law enforcement officials ,  that these two men committed that heinous crime in holcomb .  tried and convicted on four counts of murder ,  they stew in jail over a five-year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on april 14 ,  1965 .   blake and smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught .  john forsythe also does a good turn as alvin dewey ,  the chief detective investigating the crime ,  as does gerald s .  o'laughlin as his assistant .  in a tactic that is both faithful to capote's book and a good artistic gambit all around ,  brooks does not show the murders at the beginning ;  instead ,  he shows the two killers pulling up to the clutter house as the last light goes out ,  then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies .  only during the ride back to kansas ,  when blake is questioned by forsythe and narrates the story ,  do we see the true horror of what happened that night .  we don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes ,  but we don't need to .  the shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the clutters' faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough ,  so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher-film violence .   brooks wisely filmed in cold blood in stark black-and-white ,  and the results are excellent thanks to conrad hall's expertise .  the chilling jazz score by quincy jones is the capper .  the end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made ,  devastating in its own low-key fashion .  it is a 134-minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation ,  and should be seen ,  though viewer discretion is advised ;  the 'r' rating is there for a reason . 
except for an awkward scene ,  this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along .  except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie ,  this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done .  in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating .  eight out of ten stars . 
'i don't understand .  none of this makes any sense ! ' ,  exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder .  having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie ,  i know exactly how he feels .  the story ,  by the film's director aristide massacessi  ( good old joe d'amato using his real name for a change )  ,  is a clumsy mix of the supernatural ,  murder/mystery ,  and pretentious arty rubbish ,  the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as jess franco's more bizarre efforts ,  but which had me struggling to remain conscious .   opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister  ( with whom he had been having an incestuous affair ,  before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor )  ,  death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman  ( played by ewa aulin ,  who stars in the equally strange 'death laid an egg' )  is seen alive and kicking ,  the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbrück .  after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home ,  where she is tended to by creepy dr .  sturges  ( klaus kinski in a throwaway role )  ,  the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr .  and mrs .  ravensbrück  ( meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin' )  .   'so far ,  so good' ,  i thought to myself at this point ,  'we've had hunchbacks ,  incest ,  some blood and guts ,  and gratuitous female nudity'all ingredients of a great trashy euro-horror ;  what follows ,  however ,  is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings ,  ghostly goings on ,  and even elements from edgar allan poe's 'the black cat' ,  to tell a very silly ,  utterly bewildering ,  and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave .   this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb ,  but given the choice ,  i would much rather watch one of the director's sleazier movies from later in his career ;  i guess incomprehensible ,  meandering ,  surreal 70s gothic horror just ain't my thing !  2 . 5 out of 10  ( purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness )  ,  rounded up to 3 for imdb . 
unless you are an evangelical christian then make like an egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague .   awful - why oh why does imdb list the most favourable reviews at the top of the list - it was due to one of these that i have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this claptrap .   the plot premise started out strong enough - i was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the bible sermons took over .  what a waste .   this film has so incensed me that i have registered with imdb for the first time just to complain about it - i hope at least that by doing so i save someone else's evening .   hay - what a christian act on my part  ; - ) 
de palma's technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film ,  which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques ,  though unfortunately ,  as with many of the films written by de palma himself ,  the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale .    the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband .  she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously near-and the whole thing is revealed to be angie's fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed .  she has a short scene with her son ,  a dead ringer for harry potter ,  which concludes with a joke that  " she'll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter .  "  she then goes to her therapy session ,  where she complains about her dead marriage ,  before attempting to seduce her therapist ,  michael caine .  he refuses ,  and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled .   then begins a bravura 22-minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film .  among the many things de palma gleaned from hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling stories and in typical de palma fashion ,  he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill .  the problem ,  for me ,  is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director's skill .    the sequence begins with angie at an art museum .  she watches strangers ,  all involved in sexual or family activities ,  then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her .  de palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about angie's attraction ,  embarrassment ,  retreating ,  and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab ,  all set to a wonderfully lush score by pino donaggio ,  who also scored carrie .   in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy ,  and gets up to return to her husband .  again de palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered ,  as angie realizes that she doesn't have her panties ,  that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is ,  that she has probably contracted a venereal disease ,  and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle .  it's all very admirable ,  but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor ,  then up again ,  almost in real time .    .  .  . spoilers from here on out !  when angie reaches the seventh floor again ,  she is killed by a big woman with blond hair .  the woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor ,  when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there .  there is a wonderful slow-motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator ,  angie reaches up toward her ,  and the killer's blade is held poised to slash nancy's hands .  then follow some electrifying shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror .  it's all good ,  and by the time we have some dialogue again ,  you think ;   " woah ,  that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative !  "  or maybe you don't ,  but i do .   a younger dennis franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him .  he interviews michael caine ,  making the outrageous implication  ( though it passes as commonplace )  that angie wanted to be killed .  angie's son is there as well ,  and he hooks up with nancy ,  and they set about to spy on caine's therapist and find out who the killer is .   once again there is a strong tie to a hitchcock film ,  in this case psycho  ( just as obsession is a re-working of vertigo )  .  you have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut ,  who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space ,  in this case an elevator rather than a shower .  then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation ,  which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill .  de palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing .    it is very interesting ,  but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around ,  and that is my primary reservation about this film .  it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma's greatest setpieces ,  but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole-hearted affection .   --- check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies ,  cinema de merde ,  cinemademerde . com
i don't have much to add to what has been said before ,  but it's very much a film of it's time ,  and the first  ( and likely only )  time that the studio hung the film totally on the dead end kids .   the warner's gave the boys plenty of help ,  from director ray enright and an 'a' budget ,  to an almost magical cast of supporting actors .  at every turn ,  we get one of those gem performances from real pros .  they are too many to list ,  but it seems like just about everybody on the warner's lot  ( sans the very biggest stars )  walk through this picture .   ( see if you can spot john ridgely )   the only over the top performance is from the always reliable eduardo cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex .  he plays this character almost exactly like that of the thuggie leader in  " gunga din "  .  he's something to watch !  and marjorie main is excellent and gets her best role since  " dead end "  .   my bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like  " city for conquest "  .   hooray for warners ! 
the subject matter seems pretty dated today .  adapted for tv from rona jaffe's book ;  we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence .  four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game mazes and dragons  ( based on dungeons and dragons )  .  one player ,  a young tom hanks ,  enters the fantasy world too deep .  his co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm .   david wallace ,  wendy crewson and chris makepeace round out the game's foursome .  support cast is made up of veteran actors like murray hamilton ,  vera miles ,  anne francis and susan strasberg .   at this date ,  it seems lumbering and tame .  but the highlight of watching is seeing tom hanks between his  " bosom buddies "  salad days and his big splash in splash on the silver screen .  the youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment . 
i saw this picture in 1940 for $ . 11 and i would like to secure a dvd in 2006 the film was the greatest adventure of the time and , like all epics , is still an entertainment marvel  ( b&w and all ) you get a sense of real bonded friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of sam jaffe & eduardo cianelli are outstanding  ( this could not be done today i particularly liked the ending where the colonel recites the end of kipling's poem over the body of gunga din and tells the  " untouchable "   " you're a better man than i am gunga din " they don't make movies of this character today . the only cast member that is still alive today is joan fontaine
when i looked at this years wrestlemania's match card ,  i was so stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement .   it starts .  .  . and it ends .   i'm sitting there ,  angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back .  i mean ,  you watch wrestlemania 22  ( one of my favorites )  which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then .  the one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when hbk tapped out !  !  !  !  that very moment of hbk losing to john cena !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  john cena is such a loser/poser .  it almost ruined wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat triple h !  i couldn't watch wwe after seeing wrestlemania 23 .  i'm starting to watch it again  ( luckily )  .  i again have faith in wwe after wrestlemania 24  ( the greatest i have ever seen )  which was a pure classic wrestlemania .  it definitely made up for 'mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well .   if you have watched any of the wrestlemanias before this one ,  like the ones that turn you into fans  ( wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan )  ,  please don't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave wwe behind .  and if you do watch it and are angry ,  start watching it again and watch wrestlemania 24 ,  it is absolutely classic . 
i saw this film recently in a film festival .  it's the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office  ( inem )  .  i found the story very simple and full of clichés ,  taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy .  the lead actor did a good job ,  he definitely looks like an alcoholic man ,  but ana belen is not believable as a working class woman ,  she looks ,  acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman .  what i mean is that ana belen plays herself .  she does it in all her movies anyway .  the whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor .  the photography is ugly ,  not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio .  the dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times .  the comic situations are typical from gomez pereira ,  but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly .  in my opinion this film is not worth watching .  only if you really love pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit .  anyway ,  i walked out of the theater because i felt i was wasting my time .  the film-maker was by the door .  i wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films ,  specially one that is made to please everybody . 
a simple and effective film about what life is all about ,  responding to challenges .  it took a lot of gall for homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son ,  to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate .  it took also three different challenges for homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future .  the challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite ,  sputnik 1 ,  a soviet satellite ,  a milestone in human history ,  a turning point that homer and his friends could not miss ,  did not want to miss .  then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds .  finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack ,  even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity ,  and even then homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams .  but there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough .  homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need .  if he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship ,  because his friends gave him precedence ,  his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate ,  thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes .  it is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road .  but the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man ,  like mining or football .  the working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father .  if the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day ,  the working class fate i am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap .  here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think .  this might have been the fourth challenge homer had to face :  the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father .   dr jacques coulardeau ,  university paris dauphine & university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
the biggest reason i had to see this movie was that it stars susan swift ,  an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress .  time travel movies usually don't interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft ,  but this movie was fascinating and creepy .  it didn't rely on outrageous special effects and it didn't focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused .  this was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all . 
the toy box  ( 1971 )  bomb  sure ,  i like looking at nude women .  while i prefer hardcore porn flicks ,  i'll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances .  well ,  these aren't the right circumstances .  these aren't any circumstances .  there's supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere ,  but i'll be damned if i can untangle it .  this is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you ,  despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place .  bah -- if i want to see good sex scenes ,  i'll watch the real stuff . 
there's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon ;  the backgrounds are rich ,  lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco details .  the animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time ,  which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day .  however ,  i find it tedious for a number of reasons .   the music :  it's definitely not up to scott bradley's usual standards .  although it's probably supposed to be evocative of a  " great gatsby "  setting ,  it ends up being dreary ,  sleepy ,  repetitious and monotonous  ( repetitious and monotonous are not the same ,  as beethoven's 5th symphony attests )  .  since most people  ( including me )  tend to close their eyes when they yawn ,  there's a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer .   the storyline :  i'm not giving away any secrets that aren't already in the plot summary - country good ,  city bad .  this is a common theme in films ,  both animated and live ,  from this era .  it's a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll ,  which ,  in the present day ,  is reflected in a similar nostalgia for  " values "  that never were . 
if your a fan of airplane type movies this is a must see !  set in the 1920's and 30's johnny dangerously has not only great actors but great lines .   " knock down dat wall , knock down dat wall and knock down dat #@$%#@$ wall .  "   " you shouldn't hang me on a hook johnny "  or  " sounds like johnnys getting laid "  .  its definitely a spoof of the old james cagney movies and references them a lot .  there's a great scene when jhonnys walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape .  listen closely to the fake priests readings ,  its pretty funny .  another great scene is when dom delauise plays the pope .  watch his reaction to johnny after he tips the pope ,  a lot said without making a sound . i recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs . 
alice ( claire danes )  and darlene ( kate beckinsale )  have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to thailand .  due to a incident ,  they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him hong kong for the weekend .  but at the airport ,  alice and darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine and they are sent to prison .  now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship .  this was a pretty good movie ,  i've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained .  claire danes did a great job as usual ,  she is a great actress .  i would give brokedown palace 8/10
 .  .  . intimate and specific .  yes ,  a bit of a cinderella story ,  but only after many convoluted turns ,  earning it's way deeper and deeper into antwone's psyche .  only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial .  this is the stuff that heals nations ,  this is one of our great national stories .  antwone's path to emotional health encompasses a whole breadth of family history ,  the history of slavery and its aftermath .  in his first directorial effort ,  first of many i hope ,  denzel washington confirms once again ,  that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul . 
this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend .  my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store .  we had to get it .  with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night .  i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie . 
most complaints i've heard of this film really come down to one thing :  it isn't versus .  yes ,  the cast and crew is basically the same .  yes ,  kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film's second half ,  but that's about where the similarities end .  versus takes place essentially all outside ,  showcasing kitamura's ability to craft an interesting b-movie in natural locations .  for alive ,  almost everything takes place inside .  in small ,  cramped spaces .  here the art design is thrust into your face ,  and what art design it is !  we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces ,  and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces .  also a key difference is that we don't get much action here until the end of the film .  versus was all about action and cool ,  here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind .  because of this ,  alive is a far more interesting film than versus .  you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed ,  but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters .   i'm now ecstatic that i ordered the dvd despite some naysay .  you should too !  but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus - it's often slow ,  and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it .  i hope media blasters picks it up for subtitled r1 dvd release ! 
the plot : kurt harris  ( jeff wincott )  ,  a bitter ,  ex-cop goes undercover in the  " peacemakers "  after his friend is killed by their leader .  while there ,  he discovers that the woman wants to run for mayor ,  and will do anything to achieve this goal ,  even murder . the cast is good ( jeff wincott is a good martial artist and good actor )  .  .  . brigitte nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays matthias hues also him good martial artist . the direction is good ( the fight scenes also )  . the rest is ok ,  with tony burton who plays a friend of kurt killed from nilsen , and cyndi pass plays a bad girl . from producers of another action/martial arts film ( bounty tracker with lorenzo lamas ) a good action film . the best film of martial law series . 
neatly skipping over everything from the coup in cuba to his undercover entry into bolivia ,  part two of soderbergh's portrayal of che guevara is that of the tragic hero .  as with che  part one ,  this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy ,  so why was the film  ( and particularly benicio del toro's performance )  so loudly praised at cannes ?   james rocchi ,  for instance ,  called it ,  a work of art that's ,   " not just the story of a revolutionary ,  "  but ,   " a revolution in and of itself .  "  the guardian's peter bradshaw called it a  " flawed masterpiece .  "  i return to my original contention for part one  that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure .  and in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero role-models ,  could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one ,  even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life ?  this is the psychological hero enshrined by the great scottish essayist ,  thomas carlyle ,  in his seminal book ,  heroes and hero worship .  heroes can be real or imaginary  ( or somewhere in-between )  .  but should genuinely inspire us to higher goals ,  a higher purpose .  compare this with the unrealistic 'heroes' of standard western storytelling :  where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely-believable reward  usually everlasting love or material wealth  as if by divine studio intervention .  real heroes have an excess of moral courage  not lost ark dare-devilishness or james bond super-toys .  they rise ,  and empower others to rise ,  to be the best that they can be .  in part one ,  che succeeds .  in part two ,  he fails .  it is not for want of moral courage but since a )  not all good plans can succeed and b )  being human ,  mistakes are inevitable .   guevara's intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed .  it is a serious miscalculation .   high in the mountains from la paz ,  the colours are breathtaking .  there is an air of mise-en-scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in che - part one  ( the u . s .  would not allow soderbergh to film in cuba .  )  visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking red cameras .  this is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of 35mm film and the convenience of pure digital .  designed for flexibility and functionality ,  the package weighs a mere 9 lbs .   " shooting with red is like hearing the beatles for the first time ,  "  says soderbergh .   " red sees the way i see  .   .   .  so organic ,  so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena  light .  "  if che had stopped with the successful cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility .  that he fails in bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered ,  not the political triumph .  critics will say  and with some justification - that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin-pot dictatorships .  his development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves  ( and have since been used for both )  .   but for all its praiseworthiness ,  the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension .  we stumble from one escapade to another ,  knowing that he will eventually meet his death .  i found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter .  but the work that has gone into this  interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of guevara's ex-comrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the bolivian operations  make the film a commendable achievement .  it might not be top-flight entertainment ,  but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history .   there is also another very important point in the che 'hero' figure here .  it's about failure .  that if you try your utmost ,  even if you fail ,  your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage .  one could cynically call it a 'martyr' complex ,  and it is found ,  of course ,  in many religious figures as well .  but che does not 'sacrifice' himself .  he does what he does best ,  to the best of his not inconsiderate ability ,  and so provides an example .  success or failure in any particular instance become mere details .   with the u . s . 's longstanding and illegal blockade of cuba  ( all in the name of 'freedom' )  ,  i am tempted to write that che parts 1 & 2 are too good to be wasted on the u . s .  but that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid .  one must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders .  whatever its faults ,  it rehabilitates soderbergh from the populist nonsense of oceans 11 .   but if you haven't heard of che guevara or seen part one ,  or if you can't get past the phrase 'murderous marxist' without frothing at the mouth ,  i might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film .  the same can be said for many who have ,  and can . 
i rented this movie on dvd without knowing what to expect - and as i am about to study film-making in canada of all places ,  i most certainly will bring this up in class .   the story ,  centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself ,  is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on time .   if you simply couldn't laugh during  " hollywood north "  i suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away - you might have serious issues .   besides the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actors deborah kara unger and matthew modine - where they really just acting ?  jennifer tilly  ( playing a hilariously bad actress )  and martin landau ,  also delivered a very edgy ,  yet funny performance .   great film ,  even better cast . 
i saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts .  i must admit ,  i found it pretty decent .  .  . until i started to think about what the characters were saying .  logical problems :   1 .  her boyfriend ,  who seems to be a pretty fit dude ,  makes no sound while being killed .  don't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer ?    2 .  when the remark is made that the gym teacher is  " soooo in love with lisa ,  "  i almost screamed at the screen .  when your best friend's family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with her ,  you don't make comments like that if you have half of a heart .   3 .  as soon as nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead ,  wouldn't the smart thing to do be to get donna ,  boyfriend ,  aunt ,  and uncle into a car and drive far ,  far away ,  then bait the house with the hrt and police force so that the killer has no way to get out ?   i could go on .  and on .  and on .  basically ,  the plot was decent ,  the characters weren't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors .   however .   this movie might be good for teenagers ,  or young couples just looking for a fun night out .  if you don't consider all the goofs ,  it's a mediocre film . 
sequels hardly ever live up to the original .  this definitely proves true in this case .  however ,  if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch .  although the camera work is lacking ,  brian krause's character is annoying ,  and the plot is clique ,  it's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it .    don't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film .  quite frankly it's a bit different .  rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays ,  stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project ,  cabin by the lake .  this movie has a much different feel but it's still great to see stanley back in action .   i'm giving it a 6 out of 10 . 
this movie was promising :  my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war .  it had memories from  " dances with wolves "  for the big prairies ,  indians ,  military fights & from  " barry lyndon "  for the british & candles lights atmospheres .  .  .   unfortunately ,  the script is awful :  the continuity of the story is lacking  ( cuts with  " 5 months later "  ;   " 3 years later "  )  & the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it :  america is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other ;  above all ,  wait for the ending & you understand how to kill a story  ( imagine the same in  " titanic "  )  .   sometimes ,  a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker .  unfortunately bis ,  hudson is a poor one .  he has already committed  " greystoke "  and i find again the same flaws :  no dynamic in scenes ,  in editing ,  in scoring :  it is long ,  dull ,  flat .  .  .  .   i knew that this movie was a disaster for pacino's career :  now i understand .  finally ,  this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me :  a painful one .  .  . 
another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks ,  also aptly .  yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non-critically and black comedy ,  also well worth consideration .   watch the whole thing ,  all three series .  at the end ,  all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel .  the detail and intricacies are staggering .  thoroughly post-modern .  wickedly funny ,  and startlingly tragic .  not for kids .  not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity .  thought-provoking .  at once literal ,  figurative ,  and surreal in disturbing ways .  the blackest comedy i can recall .   and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see . 
this is apparently the second remake of this film ,  having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918 .  and ,  in so many ways it reminds me of the later film ,  a yank at oxford .  both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ,  ultimately ,  show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency .  in this film ,  william haines is  " tom brown "  and his main rival ,   " bob "  is played by frances x .  bushman .  and ,  in a supporting role is jack pickford--always remembered as the brother of mary .  of these three ,  pickford comes off the best ,  as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom's pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game !  all the standard clichés are there and the movie ,  because it was done so many times before and since ,  offers few surprises .  however ,  it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing .   in my opinion ,  for a better silent college film ,  try harold lloyd's the freshman--it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown .  the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era .  another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again  ( such as in westpoint and the smart set ,  among others ) --and if you've seen one of these films ,  you've seen them all .  well made ,  but certainly not original !  and ,  because it is just a rehash of his other films ,  anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films .   4/25/08==i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920 !  !  talk about over-rated !  there are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone's guess . 
german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible :  he's unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made .   lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium .  this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of ew .  i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto ,  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set .  the answer is :  subterranean ;  lommel dug a pit and buried it .   the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies .  only someone who has lived in los angeles ,  where every auto mechanic ,  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered ,  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face .   the main character ,  a villainous beat cop ,  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent .  aside from being a serial killer ,  he is also the oldest beat cop in la .  despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody ,  then drags them into his home  ( which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse )  ,  and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners ,  the lapd refuses to investigate ,  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment .   the sets are excruciatingly bad .  the production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint ;  enough to paint  " precinct 707 "  on a cardboard wall .   since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of european emigres  ( possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands )  ,  bimbos ,  mimbos ,  and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets ,  special efx ,  locations or other production value ,  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms .  sadly ,  they couldn't afford a police car ;  the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental .   more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him .  one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies .  the other fits right in ,  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated .   the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie ,  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her .  don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered ,  just accept lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride .   after much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves ,  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance .  they look exactly as they did before death ,  maybe even prettier ,  with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes .  looking nothing like zombies ,  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway .   at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll ,  and injects large doses of cheesy euro-trash techno into the soundtrack .  we're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise .  stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty .   unlike other zombies ,  lommel's girls speak and function as normal .  .  .  er ,  i mean ,  as they did before becoming zombified .  this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog .  yes ,  a golden shower it is .   i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending .  all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece .  the spirit of ed wood lives on .  .  .  or should i say his geist . 
i love occult horror ,  and the great british hammer studios ,  who delivered one of their greatest films with  " the devil rides out "   ( 1968 )  ,  have proved to be more than capable in this field of horror .  this occult tenth episode of hammer's short running tv-series  " hammer house of horror "   ( 1980 )  ,   " guardian of the abyss "  ,  is indeed a creepy entry to the series .  director don sharp ,  who had previously enriched the hammer oeuvre with  " the kiss of the vampire "   ( 1963 )  and  " rasputin :  the mad monk "   ( 1966 )  and furthermore directed two  " fu machu "  movies starring christopher lee ,  is doubtlessly one of the better-known names among the hhh directors ,  and he also delivers here .  antiques dealer michael  ( ray lonnen )  stumbles over a mysterious old scrying glass .  the scrying glass happens to be the object of desire of a devil-worshiping cult ,  who want to use it for their satanic rites .  when he shelters a beautiful young girl named allison  ( rosalyn landor )  ,  who is to be sacrificed by the cult ,  michael gets into deeper trouble with the cult and their sinister leader  ( john carson )  .  .  .  while this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of  " hammer house of horror "   ( the best one clearly is the brilliant seventh episode ,   " the silent scream "  )  ,  it is a very creepy and atmospheric one .  the plot has several interesting twists ,  and stays suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film .  ray lonnen makes a good lead ,  young rosalyin landor is convincing as the innocent beauty ,  and john carson is truly creepy as the leader of the satanists .  overall ,   " guardian of the abyss "  is another interesting and creepy hhh tale ,  and my fellow hammer fans should not miss it . 
the title creatures wreak havoc at a peaceful little desert town .  that's basically the whole plot for this film ,  and while the scenes devoted to the munchies themselves are somewhat fun  ( in a lowbrow kind of way )  ,  all the rest is just filler ,  and bad filler at that .  from the  " hero "  ,  who is a painful woody allen wannabe ,  to the ultra-dumb town cop ,  it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the film .  there were some times when almost all of them were on the screen together and i was thinking ,   " ok ,  at least the girlfriend is cute ,  but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons ?  "  .  the film is also filled with pop references  ( from ozzy osbourne to linda blair )  ,  which probably made it already dated by the early 90's .   ( *1/2 ) 
this has to be some of the worst direction i've seen .  the close-up can be a very powerful shot ,  but when every scene consists of nothing but close-ups ,  it loses all its impact .    tony scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with ,  the backdrops of mexico ,  the cantinas ,  the beautiful estate where anthony quinn lives ,  and the dusty towns costner rolls through on his journey for revenge .  unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big ,  giant head .  even the transition scenes where costner is driving alone across mexico quickly cut to a close-up .    the score is over-dramatic and intrusive ,  dictating every emotion we should feel .  the story itself should have been handled much better .  among other things ,  too many people pop up out of nowhere to help costner along - it's just bad writing .    it's a typical thriller storyline ,  but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it .  costner's no way out had a somewhat similar storyline ,  but it was a much better movie .    the ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film .  this movie was never going to be great ,  but if we saw more of mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable . 
 " plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms "  ,  informs one dopey would-be victim in  " the seedpeople "  ,  a silly ,  flaccid remake of  " invasion of the bodysnatchers "  ,   " day of the triffids "  ,  and about a thousand udder moovies .  and why are seeds moore dangerous than plants ,  one might ask ?  because ,  according to the same dolt ,   " seeds can chase us "  .  yes ,  i can remember one horrifying incident when the moocow was just a calf ,  being chased all the way home from school by ravenous dandylion seed .  .  .  yeah ,  right .  unfortunately ,  the  " monsters "  in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets ,  some of which roll around like evil tumbleweeds ,  others which sail about on strings .  there's not even the tiniest inkling of terror or suspense to be found here .  for reasons left unexplained ,  the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultra-violet lights ,  even though they can walk about in the daylight ,  which has about 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 times more uv energy .  as you can see ,  not much thought was put into this cow flop .  the moocow says go weed yer garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here .   : =8p
running only seventy-two minutes ,  this small ,  overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations .  taking place almost entirely in various ,  non-descript spots in southern los angeles ,  the story itself is inconsequential ,  but like sofia coppola's  " lost in translation "  ,  the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly ,  find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter .  it also helps considerably that morgan freeman and paz vega are playing the characters .  finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty ,  freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star .  his character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in carson ,  where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film .   out of work for a few years ,  he is embarrassed when he sees dvds of his films in the bargain bin ,  but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff .  of particular fascination to him is scarlet ,  an embittered worker from spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency .  she has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company ,  but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already .  still looking like penelope cruz's amazonian sister ,  the beautiful vega  ( one of the few redeemable aspects of james l .  brooks' execrable  " spanglish "  )  brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to scarlet .  she and freeman interplay very well throughout the story ,  which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at target ,  arby's and a full-service carwash .  nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters .   silberling keeps the proceedings simple ,  but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in phedon papamichael's vibrant cinematography  ( he lensed alexander payne's  " sideways "  )  and the infectious score by brazilian composer antonio pinto  (  " city of god "  )  .  there are fast cameos by bobby cannavale  ( as scarlet's soon-to-be-ex-husband )  and as themselves ,  danny devito and rhea perlman ,  as well as a funny bits with jonah hill  (  " knocked up "  )  as the clueless driver and jim parsons  ( the  " knight "  in  " garden state "  )  as a worshipful receptionist .  the 2007 dvd is overstuffed with extras ,  including a making-of documentary ,   " 15 days or less "  ,  aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes ;  six extended scenes ;  a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between silberling ,  freeman and vega in the middle of target ;  and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the dvd . 
darcy and her young daughter pamela are heading out to the country where her mum's boyfriend peter left his doctor's position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn .  although this inn has a terrible past and pamela learns from one the girl's who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house .  they called her the 'tooth fairy' as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth .  this work on the inn ,  has awoken the 'tooth fairy' .  now she has her sights on pamela and her last baby tooth ,  but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits pamela .   this flick's old folk myth of the 'tooth fairy' doesn't paint her in a very generous way ,  as you would believe when you were a child .  don't they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares !  another one which did fall into the same category was  " darkness falls  ( 2003 )  "  .  i can't compare how similar they are in the premises ,  because i haven't seen the latter ,  but i mostly read they have basically share the same idea .  for a little straight to dvd film ,  this dtv effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and traditionally by the book plot device .  low expectations are needed ,  as i wouldn't class it as an success ,  but i found it be to marginally entertaining .   cory strode and cookie rae brown's story or background for this 'tooth fairy' character is completely bare with it leaning more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural .  silly is a good way to describe what's happening in this poorly scripted story ,  but it never really feels like a fairytale horror .  the dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally hounded .  while the acting is simply sub-par with the bland characters they have to work off ,  but director chuck bowman offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty jolts .  this kinda makes up for the lack of suspense ,  the zero scares and generic tone .  his direction is reasonably earnest and visually able ,  where he gets some atmospheric lighting contrasting well with its slick photography .  the promising opening scene is creepily effective .  his pacing can slow up in parts and there's the odd and unnecessary slow-motion scene put in ,  but nonetheless it never gets too stodgy with something active occurring which made sure that i wasn't bored .   the make-up special effects provided the goods ,  as there's enough repulsive gruel and the tooth fairy's appearance is especially gooey .  the figure of the tooth fairy can look threatening in its black robe ,  bubbling make-up and swift movements .  being on location helps carve out a more natural feel and can get atmospherically rich in its sense of eeriness .  child actors can be incredibly annoying ,  but nicole muñoz was decent in her part .  lochlyn munro and chandra west are somewhat solid ,  but can be a little too causal in their performances as peter and darcey .  the radiantly gorgeous carrie anne fleming is one of their lodgers .  p . j soles shows up in small part as a superstitious neighbour who tries to warn them about the evil that lurks at the inn .   i thought it was a okay time-waster that has a sound concept ,  which just isn't fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff .  watchable nonsense ,  but at the same time extremely forgettable . 
jane russell proved to be a delightful musical-comedy performer in the similarly titled  " gentlemen prefer blondes "  but ,  sadly ,  this film squanders those skills .  there is a budget ,  and nice paris photography ,  but the film just doesn't work .  ms .  russell seems to be playing marilyn monroe .  that leaves nobody to adequately play jane russell .  some of the other players are way out of their element .   there are several embarrassing scenes ;  most of all ,  be warned :  there is a musical number where boneheaded african cannibals  " cook "  the brunettes in a pot ,  after alan young sings in a gorilla suit .   this is an interesting ,  at times embarrassing ,  waste of resources .    *** gentlemen marry brunettes  ( 10/29/55 )  richard sale ~ jane russell ,  jeanne crain ,  alan young ,  scott brady
dennis hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated american actors of our time ,  and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer .  most movies hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree ,  but in this movie ,  hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield .  once i got into the plot of the movie ,  i was hooked ,  but it's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film .   the concept of the film is great - not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer ,  but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer .  the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous ,  but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt .   that's about all that is good you can say about the film .  although hopper did try to act like a tough ,  experienced street smart cop ,  i can't help but feel his acting was below par ,  and there wasn't enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case .  the directing was also terrible - it didn't have the feel of a true film ,  but rather a tv-movie production .  this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down .  when the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion ,  the acting was weak ,  predictable and terribly unexciting .  that's when i knew that 1st of all ,  the action is going to be atrocious .   the angling of the camera was amateurish ,  and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer's little sister had no true distinctive effect .  if it was supposed to be scary ,  it wasn't .  everyone's acting was terrible ,  and even for hopper ,  i didn't feel for his character ,  and i just didn't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter .   the final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team .  once i saw the swat team in action ,  i was thinking ,  finally ,  something good .  but i was wrong .  1st of all ,  the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys .  that is just impossible .  2nd of all ,  apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their hka4 submachine guns with one hand .  had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun ,  these 4 idiots would've been blown to bits because they weren't even aiming at anything or paying close attention .  they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward ,  but it just looks like they're not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around .  3rd ,  swat team members do not yell out commands such as  " keep your eyes open ,  watch out for yourselves ,  are we good to go .  .  . etc .  "  in reality ,  they use hand signals or have radios .  but they're literally yelling at each other - how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you're coming ?  ?  ?  and to top it all off ,  these guys have no plan - apparently they're just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase .  eventually they end up doing nothing .  that was the last straw .  i'm no expert on special forces ,  but basically what i've just outlined ,  is pretty common sense .  when the audience knows the movie is terrible ,  the action pretty much becomes the life-saver of the movie - when you can't even make an effort to make the action great ,  the movie is lost .   i give 2 stars for the concept ,  but the rest cannot be credited .  if you want to watch a crime thriller ,  don't bother with this one .  there's plenty of crime in the movie - but it has the lack of thrill . 
i love watching early colour films - you mean those 40s clothes weren't all grey ?    margaret rutherford dominates this movie .  her  " eccentric "  garb is actually rather attractive and yes ,  she has an amazing hourglass figure .  but i feel she was given her head rather too much .  she probably developed this characterisation over many performances ,  and nobody told her  " if it gets a laugh ,  leave it out .  "  she does too much deranged fooling about when she's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth .  the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery .  arcati behaves like a retired headmistress  ( we'll really put our backs into it !  )  .  the contrast between her breezy ,  commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isn't really brought out .   just because all the actors are english  ( apart from cummings )  ,  the americans feel they have to use the words  " brit "  ,   " stiff "  ,   " lip "  and  " upper "  .  oh ,  give it a rest !  the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks  ( did he make love to you ?  yes ,  but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry !  )  . 
despite unfortunately thinking itself to be  ( a )  intelligent ,   ( b )  important and  ( c )  interesting ,  fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly .  the script makes little sense ,  the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite ,  and john lydon shows us all ,  in the space of one movie ,  why he should never have let himself out of music .  his performance is one-note and irritating .   the only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn .  his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act ,  but mercifully his performance here is restrained . 
i first watched this film when i was a kid and is the only time in my life that i can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene .  i remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation i might add  ( to my surprise i only found it on the web in the states when it was made in england !  )  when i watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same ,  of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too .  this is in my opinon the scariest film ever made ,  hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit pony and trap  ( crap )  ,  pardon the pun .  what is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates i have never heard so many screams ,  blokes as well !  even the sight of the video brings the fear of god into me of that one particular scene ,  and left me feeling that i will never walk alone again in the dark !  !  !  ! 
it took 9 years to complete this film .  i would think that within those 9 years someone would have said , hey ,  this film is terrible .  i've seen better acting in porn movies .  the story is tired and played .  abused child turns into serial killer .  how about something new for a change .  how about abused child turns into a florist ?  at least that would have been a new twist .  why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea  ( especially unoriginal movie ideas )  thinks that they can be a director ?  i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed .  that shows tenacity and spirit .  with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script .  if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer/director from michigan see hatred of a minute .  if you want a good movie from a michigan writer/director stick with evil dead . 
i have not seen this movie !  at least not in its entirety .  i have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all .  one sequence remains in my memory to this day .  a  ( very convincing looking )  spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon .  the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him .  the moon flashes into visability  .   .   .   .  and for a few seconds there it is .  parallel lines ,  squares ,  could it be  .  .  then the light fades and the brief glimse of  .  .  . what .  .  .  has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to earth .  wonderful .  i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie . 
this review owes its existence entirely to a review .  we take a weekly tv magazine to see what is coming up ,  and duly decide what we will watch .  obligingly ,  there are brief reviews of most of the films scheduled to be shown on the five major terrestrial channels .  in addition to the prose ,  each film is allocated a 1-5 star rating .  5 means don't miss  ( superior to 4 for excellent !  )  ,  down to 1 standing for poor .  we have learned from vast experience that ,  with few exceptions ,  stars are awarded for gross taste ,  foul language ,  offensive content ,  promiscuity ,  horror ,  blood & guts ,  and especially killing off the hero/heroine just when everyone was about to live happily ever after .   ( if that isn't done ,  the movie is denigrated as being 'predictable' - the worst insult imaginable !  )   brave new girl was given only 1 star ,  thereby suggesting it was a candidate worthy of our time and attention .  this was confirmed by the reviewer's description of the movie as being a  " truly awful tale "  ,  and ,   " stupid ,  just stupid "  .  we watched it ,  and my wife and i were glad we did so .  the tv magazine reviewer further stated that the movie was  " not a reworking of war and peace "  ,  with which we have to agree .  reading through the imdb reviews for this title a day or two later ,  the urge to pick up my pen  ( so to speak )  to add my halfpennyworth  ( pronounced harf'pen'uth  ( emphasis on the first syllable )  for the uninitiated )  became overwhelming .   why did we take to this movie ?  well ,  it's just a matter of taste .  we like attractive characters ,  believable relationships between them ,  interesting situations ,  courtesy and respect ,  good triumphing over evil ,  and so on .  we liked the integrity and personalities of holly  ( lindsey haun )  ,  her mum  ( virginia madsen )  ,  ditz  ( barbara mamabolo )  ,  grant  ( nick roth )  ,  zoe  ( joanne boland )  and the two male professors involved in the story .  so what if the storyline includes a 'wicked witch of the west' in the form of angela  ( barbara mamabolo )  ,  provided that she plays the part with some conviction .  we appreciated the friendship depicted between the two room-mates ,  with one having a financially challenged upbringing by a loving single mum ,  and the other having every material advantage but receiving little parental time and affection .  is it any wonder that ditz felt the way she did about holly's mum ?  is it surprising that grant should take an immediate interest in holly ,  considering the manner of their initial meeting ,  holly's dazzling smiles and her lively self-possession ?  i think these issues and the events are believable enough ,  but it is necessary to pretend that the scholarship and other circumstances are realistic in order for the tale to have a setting .   my wife and i are greatly blessed by not having any significant musical education .  this enables us to enjoy the sounds produced by instruments and voices without having our critical faculties intruding unduly on our listening ,  and thus spoiling the experience .  we enjoyed both the classical pieces and the pop ,  which came over well on the tv ,  and we weren't struck by any lack of talent .  also ,  it mattered not that holly's classical vocals were dubbed by someone else .   we enjoyed the movie enough to look for a dvd .  the average delivered price we have paid per disk for the movies in our collection currently stands at £4 . 9484  ( rounded to four decimal places )  .  brave new girl was available from a trusted supplier on the amazon marketplace for £1 . 3516  ( rounded to four decimal places )  above this figure .  such a purchase would increase the average .  why i should resent this is a mystery to me ,  but it is a testimony to our enjoyment of this film that we placed an order anyway .  i have awarded this film 7 imdb stars out of ten ,  having docked one for overenthusiastic reception of the performances by the audiences ,  one for britney advertising and one for something else i can't remember right now .   ( in case it hasn't tumbled ,  this review is an anthem in celebration of the use of brackets !  ) 
if you've ever wanted to see a film that stresses style over substance ,  this is for you .  to me ,  son de mar is beautiful to see ,  but there's precious little substance ,  unless mawkish ,  melodramatic ,  manipulative love yarns turn you on .  this may be one of those famous 'chick flicks' you've heard so much about .    we're about half-way through this film before anything really happens :  ulises  ( jordi molla )  goes out to sea looking for tuna ,  and doesn't come back ,  leaving his wife martina  ( leonor watling )  and son to fend for themselves .  then ,  in a furious six minutes of screen time ,  they bury ulises ,  martina gets married again ,  and her son grows into mid-childhood .  this rapid transposition is jarring ,  to say the least ,  and very sloppy :  after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around ,  we're suddenly into a full-blown melodrama ,  all in six minutes .  i think this is called wayward narrative pacing .   five years later ,  ulises  ( as in the wandering superhero ulysses ;  get it ?  )  ,  returns to his 'penelope'  ( watling )  only to find she's married to sierra  ( eduard fernandez )  ,  an inexplicably wealthy guy  ( what does he do to earn all that dough ?  )  who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets .  when martina ,  in great anger ,  questions ulises about his absence ,  he tells her that he'll take her to the island of sumatra someday and she'll understand everything .   and here's the thing :  he doesn't take her to the island of sumatra .  the reference just dies somewhere in the script .  he doesn't really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years .  he doesn't acquit himself as an honourable guy ,  and the movie doesn't fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film .  i can only assume that director bigas luna wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues  ( fish ,  reptiles ,  the sea )  he offers through breathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue .  it just doesn't work .  the narrative 'arc' on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clothesline .   i'm sure jordi molla is a good actor ,  but i just couldn't buy his ulises as any kind of hero  ( which is what the original ulysses was supposed to be )  .  with moist sensuality ,  he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from virgil roughly 2 , 000 times and each and every time it excites martina to explosive orgasm .  this guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriages .  i'm sure virgil would be impressed .  he didn't get laid that often ,  as i understand it .    this poetic 'device' figures prominently in the film ,  and i had no choice but to assume it was a gender reversal of ulysses' famous 'siren song'  ( i . e .  beautiful maidens singing seductively to far-off sailors ,  who were doomed if they answered the ,  well ,  siren call )  .  if this is what bigas luna is up to ,  you can see the problem -- he's offering convoluted symbolism in a snatch-and-grab attempt at high art .  once again ,  it just doesn't work ,  at least in my eyes .   watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor ,  but she gives us a character here who doesn't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth .  it's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a for-rent sign on his face  ( as in vacant )  ,  oily 1960s-style hair that looks more like seaweed ,  and one of those trendy 21st-century 'beards'  ( you know ,  four days' growth ,  no more ,  no less )  .  he's supposed to be a dreamy kind of guy  ( i think )  ,  but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script .    but ,  don't despair ,  this film is great to look at .  just don't try to connect the dots on the red herrings or think too much about what you're hearing in the way of dialogue .  you can do a lost of fast-forwarding on this film  ( particularly in the first 40 minutes )  and you really won't miss much . 
i am a fan of the nightmare series but this one is horrible .  the deaths are so trendy .  if you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated .  i did like the flashbacks .  i think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive .  that would have been more interesting .  this is a movie you can take or leave .  depends on how much spare time you have . 
while filming an 80's horror movie called 'hot blooded' ,  the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer .  after all of this ,  the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust .  so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they're warned by people to keep away from the film ,  as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film .  from this it's labelled as a cursed production .  not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role ,  but not as the daughter but the mother .  but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film's killer .   look what 'scream' started !  hey ,  i enjoy those films ,  but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses .  during this stage the sub-genre came back with vengeance ,  but it wasn't much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts ,  where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise .  'cut' which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick .  but you know what ,  i found it a cheesy delight .  yeah ,  it's gawd awful and highly forgettable ,  but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted .  although i did hate it when i originally came across it ,  but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it .  it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again ,  but this time it wasn't so sweet .   the film came out around the same time as 'scream 3' and 'urban legends :  the final cut' did ,  which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie .  'scream 3' is obviously the strongest of the three ,  but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends :  the final cut .  though ,  it did seem more of a throwback to the 80's slashers than that of one of scream's bastard offspring .  pretty much the film is given b-grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances .  the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense .  while ,  the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it .  she plays the wash-up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send-up performance .  she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly .  the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars  ( that's if you're an australian )  with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts .  also pop singer  ( and supposed actress )  kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up !  nice .  these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim-witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed .  sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue ,  because they have no real substance to be there .   the plot starts off rather interestingly ,  then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up ,  but then it makes a sudden u-turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre .  simply it's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinking oh my .  this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner ,  but sadly it falls along way .  but don't you just love an opening ending .  also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential ,  tongue-in-cheek approach .  predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over-stated at times ,  but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit .  the atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness ,  but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added 'some' spookiness .  the cinema scene is done rather nicely too .   now ,  now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick ,  but sadly there's no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard ,  if lacking but it's more then decent for such low-budget flick .  there are one or two creative deaths ,  but the rest are systematic .  the killer wasn't bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought ,  well the smart-ass attitude didn't sit well with me .  another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut-away editing ,  out-of-place soundtrack and kimble rendall's direction lacked execution and was pretty careless ,  but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness .   the imagination matches the budget that's for sure ,  but heck this lousy slasher wasn't trying to be anything else .  pure schlock that's slightly amusing ! 
this is by far my most favourite movie in the world !  !  !  !  !  i enjoyed it when i was 4 and i still enjoy it at 16 !  !  its an absolute masterpiece !  no video collection is complete without it !  !  !  i enjoy every second of it and not only does the film have some great special affects but its sends a great message to the youngsters of the audience which may sound sheesy but in actual fact the movie is done very cooly in actual fact !  although michael jackson has been in afew movies now ,  people still dont see him as an actor .  in reality he's the most talented actor i know !  he's so talented !  he's incredible !  !  !  moonwalker is a must see !  !  !  !  !  ! 
don't know how this missed award nominations .  great film .  certainly of the calibre of  " beautiful mind "  great acting ,  photography ,  script and drama .  i can't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film . 
will farmer  ( lanter )  plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack ,  and ripley ,  the super government computer ,  designed to profile potential terrorists ,  tracks him because will borrowed  ( by hacking )  some money from his next door neighbor's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in philadelphia .  the next door neighbor whose computer will was fixing ,  has relatives in the mid-east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor's bank  ,  and ripley sees a terrorist connection .  ripley has the power to call up missile strikes .  oh ,  oh !   this version of war games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the war games movie in the early 1980s .  well ,  the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days .  makes sense .  so the movie dazzles us with fantastic cgi on computer screens ,  and once joshua ,  the forerunner to ripley ,  is found operational ,  we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing ,  hoping ,  praying . sort of ,  oh-oh-ing ,  omg-ing ,  and more cringing hoping things will go their way .  in other words we are now experiencing a made-for-tv type movie ,  and it's oh hum time .  go back to the 1980s and watch the original war games movie .  it's much better .    but ,  we really have to ask ourselves :  are we making computers too intelligent where one day ,  in time ,  they will rule us ?  hmmm .  .   violence :  yes .  sex :  no .  nudity :  no .  language :  no . 
thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor .  david morse is the responsible ,  straight-laced cop and 'good' brother ;  viggo mortensen ,  the 'bad' boy ,  is a former soldier and ex-convict .  as an actor  ( particularly in his earliest years )  ,  sean penn seems to have modulated his performances under the method .  turning first-time writer and director for this arty ,  obtuse drama ,  he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process ,  slowing the pacing down to a crawl  ( ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection )  .  this approach might be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters to care about ,  but photogenic morse and mortensen aren't really convincing as siblings .  worse ,  we expect more from prominently-billed veterans charles bronson and sandy dennis ,  who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting .  the picture is balky with turgid sequences ,  a wobbly narrative and confusing editing  ( always slanted to point up the artistic excesses )  .  penn's tricks with the camera show off a talented eye ,  yet they are mostly an irritation .  *1/2 from ****
fairly good movie ,  but not a true story .   rubin  " hurricane "  carter was a notorius liar ,  a murder and was never found not guilty .  new jersey state just didn't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone .  carter got an offer in 1976 :   " pass a lie test and go free "  .  he didn't take it .  this film should never have been made ,  but money talks .  a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white .  why choose a fake story ?   jens
this is a bad movie .  not one of the funny bad ones either .  this is a lousy bad one .  it was actually painful to watch .  the direction was awful , with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly .  keira knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all , and i cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid .  the script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard .  if you haven't seen it , don't .  you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel  . i have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults .  this one is just a waste of time . 
welcome to collinwood is a lot of things ,  but it is none of the following :   a george clooney star vehicle unfunny un-original  and yes i know ,  the basis for the movie is another movie .  but as far as hollywood goes ,  this may rank with their most authentic outputs this decade - and for me ,  it does .   the movie is from start to finish ,  an absolute gas .  here's why .   there isn't a bad performance in the film .  the funny parts are funny .  the edgy parts are edgy .  the script contains ,  not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful .  and it doesn't conform to the hollywood norm  ( you'll see what i mean ,  when you see the film )   when i was a kid ,  i remember seeing advertisements for the film .  this film went under the radar after not grossing much at the box office ,  and isn't even a cult classic .  the reason why transformers 2 ,  is seen as acceptable by average movie goers ,  is because they are used to seeing transformers 2 .  if film's as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multi-million pieces of s**t ,  the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place -   when 'they' say they don't make em like they used to ,  'they' didn't see welcome to collinwood .   a fun ,  mini-masterpiece of caper comedy ,  that refuses to compromise .  one of my favourites . 
i think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like  " my girl "  .   " my girl "  was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters  ( macaulay culkin as thomas j .  )  dies .  the story was over after the first movie .  i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on .  that was senseless ! 
this movie is hilarious .  the problem is that it's not a comedy .  one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a pommel-horse in the middle of a village square  ( which he uses to pummel the bad guys .  )  another is the trek into the  " village of crazies .  "  too bad this movie wasn't made to be a farce ,  or it may have gotten better ratings . 
dressed to kill starts off with kate miller  ( angie dickinson )  having a sexually explicit nightmare ,  later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr .  robert elliott  ( michael caine )  for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated & unfulfilled in her current marriage .  kate then visits a museum & picks up a stranger ,  they go back to his apartment for casual sex ,  when done kate is set to leave but is attacked & killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman .  prostitute liz blake  ( nancy allen )  discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape .  detective marino  ( dennis franz )  says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate's son peter  ( keith gordon )  to track down the real killer ,  clear liz's name & see that justice is done .  .  .   written & directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery .  the script is measured & slow at times but it likes to focus on the character's so you really know them ,  the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off ,  then the film switches it's attentions to liz & no one else gets a look in .  this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing & engaging ,  unfortunately the character's themselves aren't exactly likable .  i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times ,  especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally .  the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill .  it's a good film but it didn't excite me that much & i didn't really find any character to root for or like .  the film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that i didn't really see the point of .   director de palma directs with style & visual flair ,  from the art museum sequence to a car chase & as a whole it's impeccably filmed throughout .  i'd imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it .  i felt the film was a bit flat & uninspired at times though ,  nothing about it really excited me that much .  there is a fair bit of nudity ,  some sex & rape along with a few bits of gore & violence ,  kate's murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight ,  if that's the right word .  however ,  it's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe .   with a supposed budget of about $6 , 500 , 000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film .  the new york locations are nice ,  the cinematography is good & as a whole it's extremely well made .  i thought the music was inappropriate & was far to loud & intrusive .  the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn't think caine had that much screen time .  allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made ,  interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them ,  this & blow out  ( 1981 )  ,  he cast her as a prostitute .  .  .  a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start .   dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn't think it quite lived up to it's lofty reputation .  good but not brilliant . 
i'll be honest- the reason i rented this movie was because i am a huge fan of kyle chandler's  ( most notably from early edition )  .  since he usually plays the good guy ,  i wanted to see him as in a different role  ( out of curiosity )  .  the plot itself also drew me in ;  a wanna-be hitman  ( tony greco- a . k . a .  mr .  chandler )  must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life- or ,  rather ,  the death- of a witness who will testify against someone in  " the family "  .  the movies was nothing like i expected .  it was sick ,  i hated the end  ( if you saw it ,  you'd know why )  ,  and there were so many unnecessary parts .  basically- it was filthy ,  and made little sense .  yes ,  it was a mob movie ,  and yes the guns do go boom .  but there's more to a movie than that .  this film acted as if it didn't have the time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it .  the acting really made up for it- james belushi was pretty amusing as  " the rose "  .  sheryl lee made angel seem as believable as she could get .  she surprised me the most .  and kyle chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to  " the family "  .  if only the script did justice to the actors . 
melvyn douglas and joan blondell co-star in  " the amazing mr .  williams ,  "  a 1939 mystery/comedy that's quite good ,  although forgotten ,  probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939 .   douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job ,  while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed .  what happens in this film is no exception - he's called to a murder scene just as he's about to walk down the aisle yet again .   both stars were excellent at comedy ,  worked together well  ( and often )  ,  and help make this battle of the sexes fun .  edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support .   as you can read in other reviews ,  melvyn douglas doesn't make much of a woman .   entertaining if a little on the long side .   one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas ,  one of our greatest actors .  he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man .  he wasn't lazy ,  but rather ,  a very hard-working actor  ( who made it look easy )  who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career .  he just wasn't cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system .  i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in  " hud "  and  " i never sang for my father "  and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk . 
some of the acting was a bit suspect .  i remember that asswipe alexander walker  ( evening standard critic ,  yeah ok ,  he's now dead )  launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying ni protestants as murderers .  now with respect to all ni protestants ,  this film was loosely based on the shankill butchers  ( who were loyalists ) and who roamed belfast in the 1970's .  believe me ,  they were not called butchers for nothing .  my main moan about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope ,  it's all doom & gloom ,  i mean did the little girl at the end have to die .  maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the tact that not all prods & tiags are bad or wholly good either . 
i find this movie very enjoyable .  the plot is simple and easily digestible ,  the humour is light and clean ,  and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common ,  i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out .  turns out to be very nice .  the performance of the female lead is admirable ;  her portrayal of an innocent ,  naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to david's sophisticated role was very charming .  i also find vera's dancing very ,  very well done .  i find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly .   for those who have had enough of profanity-filled movies of today ,  you will enjoy this movie thoroughly . 
a fierce ,  shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi who wrote  " my beautiful laundrette "  ,   ( this is the best thing he's done since then )  .  it's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much .  they've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels .  the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex .  he has his own motives but kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion .  this is a film in which people and places feel familiar ,  where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen .  in some respects it's a bit like  " sunday ,  bloody sunday "  but it's an altogether tougher piece of work .  the director ,  roger michell ,  allows scenes to build instinctively .  and it is beautifully acted .   as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture .  there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived-in performance ,  and that very fine actor daniel craig displays shadings to his character than even kureishi hasn't tapped into .  if the film strikes a false note it is ,  perhaps ,  in the character of the talentless daughter ,  caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces  ( or should that be the other way round )  and even messier life ,  but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless .  the film is also extremely beautiful to look at  ( dop alwin kuchler )  and must rank ,  unhesitatingly ,  as the best british film of the year . 
there is something in most of us ,  especially guys ,  that admires some really working class small town  " real men "  populist fare .  and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top .  hey ,  a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy ,  but i don't rate movies or actor/directors based on politics or personality .  that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does .  while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director ,  i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since .    okay ,  you have the gist of this there is this good cop ,  a small town trooper ,  joe ,  played against type by david morse ,  who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars .  the bad guy stops ,  gets out ,  shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead .  there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone .  so we know that joe ,  the farmer forced off his land into a cop job ,  is a good basic sort of guy .  then his brother frank shows up ,  he is a sadistic ,  amoral bully ,  fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up .  some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral ,  sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off .  then there is mom and dad ,  marsha mason and charles bronson ,  who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple ,  then die off ;  she by illness and he by shotgun suicide ,  to advance the story for us .  both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob .  but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife .  but joe has a nice wife ,  played by italian actress valeria golina ,  who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut .  for me ,  that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and cool .   but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend's car ,  robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do .  then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them .   so the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater .  accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate ,  except for the 60's era effect ,  to win the hearts of old hippies .  the worst offense is that ,  since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song ,   " the highway patrolman "  ,  that song was not included .    so joe's brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim's spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife .  the bartender is good ole ceasar ,  played by dennis hopper .  so viggo - frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leaves .   so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away .  instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50's junker on some lonely road at night ,  and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe ,  the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence .  oy ,  such dreck !  then to top off this drecky sap fest ,  there is some zen crap about the indian runner ,  who is a messenger ,  becomes the message ,  ala marshall macluhen ?  see what i mean ,  sean has done much better than this so don't be afraid to miss this one . 
rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements ,  facials and performances of  " not humans "  .  this time he is the animal .  marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day ,  nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked ,  so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man .  but on his way to the crime scene ,  he crashes with his car and gets really damaged .  he doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day ,  his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts .  of course ,  we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings ,  are useless .  she is played by collen haskell .  there are no negative characters .  the negative character ,  is destiny if i could use this metaphor .  marvin should find out ,  how to become a normal human being again .  by the way-his animal instincts ,  helps him in some situations .  schneider's performance is a so-so .  the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies ,  called mindless fun as i have written above .  so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in .  he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie . 
curly sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drifter .  she and her father ,  bill  ( jim belushi )  ,  try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists .  in chicago ,  bill decides to jump in front of a car in a pricey parking garage while curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim .  it happens to be a very upscale lawyer named grey  ( kelly lynch )  who is appropriately appalled at what she has done .  not only do the scammers make some cash ,  they get to spend the night at grey's plush apartment .  even then ,  grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell .  grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life .  who better to teach her than bill and curly ,  those savvy experts on life's realities ?  but ,  all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of con men .  or is there ?  this is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected .  curly is certainly as entertaining as shirley temple but much edgier ,  of course .  belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch lawyer .  john hughes ,  as writer and director ,  shows us his magic touch once again ,  as the script is lively and unpredictable .  just watch curly and bill take grey out for a night ,  with no money ,  and see the humorous results .  do you long for happy endings ,  long promised and finally delivered ,  with a few uncertain moments in between ?  this is your made-to-order movie . 
 .  .  . for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c**p must now be compared .   first off ,  the beginning did have elements of style .  .  .  . and if handled well ,  could have become a cult classic ,  a-la pulp fiction or a desi desperado .  .  . but the plot  ( was there one ?  )  begins to meander and at one point completely loses it .   throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english ,  a call center smart alec ,  a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb ,  a levitating ,  gravity defying hit-man and a cop with a hundred  ( or was it a thousand )  black cat commandos on their trail .  .  .  . good ingredients in competent hands .  but this is where i would like to ask the director :  sir ,  what were you smoking ?   im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers .    possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music .  .  . watch the videos .  .  . hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed .  vishal- shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes .    how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy .  .  .  .   as i sign off ,  i want to really ,  badly know how does akshay's bullet wound vanish in a microsecond .  .  . what were you editors doing ?  tashan ,  maybe .  .  . 
i had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie .  it was an epic of adolescence ,  a dream of summers gone ,  a great potential indie film or big budget drama .  it somehow got into the hands of a hack ,  who clearly took notes watching boogie nights and rushmore without actually learning anything at all .  the script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags .  i feel sorry for the actors ,  since the characters in the book were rich and textured ,  but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film .  mason gamble is great when given the opportunity ,  as is dylan baker ,  but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special .  poor people = good ,  rich people = bad .    though it's almost worth watching to see the southern california beach where gary sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in delaware .    it's a good book ,  but an embarrassing turn for first time director mills goodloe .    k . 
during the cheap filmed in video beginning of crazy fat ethel ii ,  i wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover .  unfortunately ,  it was .  the story itself is mindlessly simple .  ethel ,  a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder ,  is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding .  she is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another's soup .  ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food .  ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then .  .  .  . well ,  you get the idea .  if this all sounds like fun ,  it isn't .  this film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting .  the characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store .  to make matters worse ,  half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first ethel movie ,  criminally insane ,  which is little better .  a very poor effort . 
 .  .  .  and the series lets you forget all that .  i am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series .  born in 1958 ,  i learned to drive during the first gas shortage ,  and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979 .  the 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation ,  competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings ,  dreadful music ,  worse clothes .   the funny thing is ,  this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun ,  even for those of us old enough to know better .  it manages to look the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times .  then there are the parents .  the two young lovers in the show - eric forman and donna pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions .  eric's parents ,  red and kitty ,  are not exactly june and ward although they are conventional for the decade .  they represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's .  donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy .  eric's friends fez ,  kelso ,  and jackie round out the group representing nerdiness ,  well-meaning incompetence ,  and snobbishness respectively .  hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs ,  but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents .  i highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of eric . 
this may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time & through time to when one's childhood starts a journey to reminiscences back & forth onwards & upwards , forwards & backwards , up & down & all around . the boy jimmy , h . r .  puffinstuff , dr . blinky , cling & clang , ludicrous lion , & even the evil witchie poo too through & through .  the latter day inspirations of lidsville ,  " the brady kids saturday morning preview special "  sigmund & the sea monsters , and land of the lost both the new & old are what this very show bridged the gap to as well as the donny & marie show , the brady bunch variety hour a . k . a .  brady bunch hour & even the paul lynde halloween special .  maybe even other things in between & beyond the buck just keeps on moving on & on & even beyond expectations & as well as unexpected bounds . now as we get updated in march of '06 we know that jack wild's gone & so now it make's it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgic . including now in august of '06 both when jack wild guest stars as himself on sigmund and the sea monsters as well as when on a latter episode h . r . puffinstuff does too and to recall all of the other nostalgic journeys of all the syd & marty kroft characters as well including the h . r . puffinstuff goodtime club ; the donny and marie show ; the brady bunch variety hour a . k . a .  the brady bunch hour ; etc .  truthfully , stephen  " steve "  g .  baer a . k . a .

this is one strange hacked together film ,  you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one ,  i'm not surprised there's no credits on it ,  who would want to be associated with this film .  the acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over ,  it all makes very little sense .  as i said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn't shot that needed to be ,  and all the music was very ill-fitting library music  ( cheap i guess )  .  very ,  very odd .  i might actually buy a dvd of it though ,  if it could let me in on what the hell was going on ,  and what happened to this movie . 
this couldn't have been better .  the strong restraints on mike sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way .  tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career .  young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel ;  playing the basis character for the story .  and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time .   this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner .  this is a father/son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles .  mike sullivan had no father as a child ,  so john rooney took him in .  although a generous man ,  mr .  rooney involved himself in organized crime .  therefore ,  the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business .  now ,  sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe ,  but at the same time pay back his boss .  the events to follow ,  will test sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate .   with a great adaptation by david self ,  the dialogue comes out seldomly ,  but yet very virtuous .  the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting  ( brilliant art direction by richard l .  johnson & nancy haigh )  covered with a dark rainy  ( snow on the ground )  exterior .  driving the story ,  is thomas newman's wonderful irish score ,  settling in only when necessary .   but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l .  hall's beautiful photography .  this is some of the best cinematography i've seen ;  and i watch a lot of films .  the scene when mike and michael are in the car ,  entering chicago is quite impressive .  the shot starts at the front of the car ,  revealing mike ( hanks )  through the windshield .  it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car ,  to see michael ( hoechlin )  awakening and peering out his side window .  as it continues ,  it trucks sideways and dollys back ,  completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930's chicago .   with a great cast and crew ,  the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film .  i'm talking about sam mendes ,  who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty .   ( won him various awards )  before american beauty ,  mendes worked as a play director for the british theater ,  but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater .  with only two films ,  sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors  ( in a list of about twenty-five )  .   the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly .  the photography ,  acting and story is phenominal .  i'm still waiting for scorcesee's gangs of new york ,  but for now ,  i'm fully confident in saying that this is the  " best film of the year "  .  considering it's competition  ( signs ,  insomnia ,  minority report )  thats a strong statement . 
as with all the other reviewers ,  this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years .  i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story .  i even wrote to the pbs station for more information .  despite all this ,  all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s .   fastward to 2002 ,  after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was ,  a vhs copy of the movie .  there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie .  the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her .  despite owning a copy ,  i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie .  you can find it at :  http : //www . johntopping . com/harvey%20perr/war%20widow/war_widow . html
i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine .  it wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic .  the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands .  directing and acting were awful !  !  i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs .  although the movie started promisingly ,  it got worse and worse .  i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters .  .  i still think that it is worth watching as i haven't seen films subjecting gay porn .  don't keep your expectations high though , then you will be very disappointed .  * out of *****
musings :  pure delight from beginning to end .  not a laugh riot ,  but a more subtle ,  sophisticated humor .  what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors ,  including reginald denny ,  nestor paiva ,  ian wolfe ,  harry shannon and jason robards sr .  .    cary grant is at the building sight of his new home ,  which is at that point ,  being framed .  a young carpenter ,  played by future tarzan lex barker ,  asks him if he wants his  " lallies to be rabbeted "  ,  or some such thing that only a carpenter would know .  grant ,  not wanting to appear ignorant ,  replies in the affirmative .  at that ,  barker yells up to his mates ,   " ok boys ,  he wants 'em rabbeted ,  so .  .  .  . yank 'em out !  "  a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards .  all grant can do is moan .   yes ,  the movie is dated .  you'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home ,  and a place like that ,  in connecticut of all places ,  would probably run a few million bucks .   a classic movie that is really a treasure . 
i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old .  i was a huge comic book reader at the time ,  and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily .  the end result ,  however ,  was underwhelming .   i was aware of the  " emma peel "  diana prince stories ,  as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her amazonian form .  however ,  there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie .  the final costume was an interesting idea ,  but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero .   i saw the movie again in my late teen years .  it hadn't improved much .  cathy lee crosby was more familiar ,  thanks to that's incredible ,  but her acting was no better .  the script had a few good ideas ,  like the rogue amazon ,  and a decent villain in ricardo montalban ,  but it just didn't come together and was still boring .   i think they should have built the back story better ,  and built the show into a more epic climax .  it was too much like a bland spy film ,  crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book .  the amazon elements were intriguing ,  but needed to be expanded .   the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful ,  if a bit too camp and low budget .  the budget was also pretty low here ,  and superheroes don't come cheap .   it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd ,  if only as a comparison and historical document .  even superman 4 is available ,  and it has nothing over this film  ( except chris reeve and gene hackman )  .  it's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions . 
i'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so bad ,  i felt embarrassed for not only the  " actors "  ,  but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock .   from the title ,  you'd expect some great carnage ,  somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog .  instead ,  you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode .  at least i laugh at the three stooges .  while watching this crap ,  i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happened .   needless to say ,  i kept watching stern .   watching this  " film "  i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys ,  2 dv cameras ,  $50 dollars in loose change and a broken pc .  this film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making .  watch this movie if you dare ,  but be warned .  .  . there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action .  this makes  " kazaam "  look like a meryl streep film .   i'm sure germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence .  other countries need to take heed . 
amen to magsel .  there was a lot of confusion going on .  first off ,  how do you know which movie you are purchasing ?  henry cele stars in every one of them .  i bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries .  .  . what a letdown !  !  it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped .  david hasselhoff  ( spelling ?  )  is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film  ( where was his english accent ?  )  and what's with the love story ?  ?  ?  the movie was supposed to be about a young man's rise to military power - not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her daddy .  .  .   if i had paid more than $7 for this movie ,  i would have to call the police - because that would be a crime ! 
what an extraordinary crime thriller !  !  my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival .  it's already my second favourite film of all-time after dr .  strangelove and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my wife .   i don't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions .  a synopsis that i'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers ,  played by phillip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke ,  are planning to rob a jewellery store in westchester ,  new york .  the film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time  ( before ,  during and after the robbery )  ,  and one key scene is repeated at least three times .  ordinarily ,  that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece .  the excitement ,  the tension ,  and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed .  by the end ,  i was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up .  i know that i've used a few clichés in this post ,  but i literally was on the edge of my seat .  i should mention that the non-linear storyline is quite easy to follow .  this isn't the sort of movie where you'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie .   the acting is absolutely brilliant all-around ,  and i doubt i would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn't been so perfect .  a tiny complaint is that hoffman and hawke don't look like brothers ,  but that's a minor quibble that i can easily overlook .  hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with hawke were positively electric .  marisa tomei  ( as hoffman's wife )  and albert finney  ( as the father of hoffman & hawke )  are also very good in supporting roles .  even some cameo performances were so impressive that i can still remember every remark ,  gesture and facial expression by brian o'byrne and michael shannon  absolute perfection .  the robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene i've ever watched ,  and i had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes ,  especially the ones with hoffman .  the music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie ,  often the same notes played over very effectively .  i had the music playing in my head the following day ,  even as i sat through other films .  in addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph ,  there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable  ( major spoiler ,  so i can't describe the scene )  .  otherwise ,  this film is pretty darn close to perfect .   there were about a dozen great films at the festival that i would enjoy watching a second time but before the devil knows you're dead stands in a league of its own .  as an aside ,  the director sidney lumet spoke before the film and he introduced marisa tomei and ethan hawke onto the stage .  tomei didn't speak and she acted a bit shy so lumet asked  " can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy ?  "  that comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene !  ! 
i cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally .  as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema .  i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book  " film "  ,  which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re-read today .  my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin ,  drifters  ( grierson's magnificent documentary )  ,  metropolis ,  the cabinet of dr caligari ,  and ecstasy ;  came first through this book and later at my university art-house cinema .  ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican ,  for condoning eva's desertion of emil ,  her subsequent divorce ,  and the brief swim she took in the buff ,  but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant ,  outstandingly beautiful ,  visual paean to love - a view echoed by many imdb users .  a very lonely young man ,  when i saw it ,  i willingly concurred .  no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos - by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed .  quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial .  ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence ,  against which individual lives are insignificant - perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term 'the lifeforce' .    ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong .  disappointed ,  she returns home and divorces him .  soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding .  she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience .  her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing .  but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself .  after these exciting climacteric sequences ,  a bland ,  predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy ,  collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy .  this story is trite ,  the acting is no more than adequate ;  and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage ,  as did most of its contemporaries ,  long ago .  what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography ,  a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction ,  coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important - it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film .  it is sub-titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub-titles ,  and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward .  this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch .  the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it .  for example ,  the names - eva and adam ;  the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him ;  the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery  ( a bee pollinating a flower ,  a key entering a lock ,  a breaking necklace during eva's virginal lovemaking sequence with adam ,  etc .  )  ;  and the final post-suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society ,  as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on .    as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 - even comparing it with contemporary works i would not reduce this below 8 .  for me the film will always remain a  " must see "  ,   ( although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment )  .  unfortunately in north america contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930's reaction to hedy kiesler's very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood  ( some critics ,  who have clearly not seen such classic films as hypocrites ,  hula ,  back to god's country ,  bird of paradise or some of the early works of d . w .  griffiths and c . b .  demille ,  have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film )  .  this scene was probably part of the original novel ,  and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite it .   two further thoughts ;  firstly this is a czech film ,  released there in 1933 .  its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations  ( i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film - were they removed from the copy i saw then ?  )  .  secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime .  we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience . 
you have to admire brad sykes even if you don't particularly want to ,  a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions .  but keeps on doing it all the same .  even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his camp blood films is given grudgingly and i'm as guilty of this as anyone .  brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix ,  a neat idea ,  a kooky character ,  whatever ,  but without the funds to take it further than base level ,  he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be .  joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film .  coming to a multiplex near you ,  in a parallel universe ,  somewhere . 
this is very much not the sort of movie for which john wayne is known .  he plays a diplomat ,  a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action .  the film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story .   for the open-minded ,  the patient and the thoughtful ,  this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history .   there are two intertwining stories .  the big story is of internalised ,  isolationist japan and externalised ,  expansionist america clashing when their interests conflict .  the small ,  human ,  story is of an outsider barbarian  ( wayne )  and a civilised geisha's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love .  the human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations .   the movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well .  the two lead roles are performed to perfection .  john wayne is excellent as townsend harris ,  striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the japanese .  eiko ando is likewise excellent as the geisha of the title ,  charming and delightful .  the interaction between her character and john wayne's is particularly well portrayed .  this is exactly how these two individuals  ( as they are depicted in the film )  would have behaved .   the script is very well written .  it lacks all pomposity .  and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred .  the characters are real people ,  not self-consciously  " great "  figures from history .  furthermore ,  the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety .  indeed ,  the clash of a traditionalist ,  and traditionally powerful ,  isolationist japan and a rising ,  newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between john wayne and the local japanese baron .  wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in japan ,  and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water .  the baron responds that japan just wants to be left alone .  wayne's character replies that japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping ,  and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway .  a very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right ,  and saw the other as being in the wrong .  the resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history ,  a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future .   cinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century japan ,  before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century ,  is excellent .  a visual treat ,  and an enlightening insight into japan's ancient civilisation .   i highly recommend anyone ,  whether a john wayne fan or not ,  to watch this film if you get the chance .  just be aware that it isn't an action film .  it is a representation of an interesting place and time in history ,  and a slow-boiling love story which  ( much to their surprise )  comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters .  watch this film on its merits ,  without preconceptions ,  allow yourself to be immersed in its story ,  and you will thoroughly enjoy it .   all in all ,  an excellent film . 
what could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor .  fox is ok as nathaniel ayers ,  the julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the walt disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row .  looking for a good story to boost his flagging career ,  reporter steve lopez {robert  " rehab "  downey } gets to know him and tells his story .  taking every element of the classic  " how we hit the skids "  movies ,  borrowing very liberally from  " a beautiful mind "  ,  taking the bogus  " feel good "  attitude of films like  " rocky " -you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie .  it is corny ,  trite ,  utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments .  i hate to say it ,  but this is the kind of movie that ,  if you say you hated it ,  people will give you bad looks .  i really wish i could say something positive about this film ,  but i really can't .  the acting redeems it somewhat ,  but not enough for me to give it more than one star .  strictly made for tv movie stuff .  not worth your time . 
one of the many merrie melodies cartoons that entertained american moviegoers during wwii ,  bob clampett's  " an itch in time "  portrays a hobo flea settling on elmer fudd's dog .  the little guy turns into a real sadist while making a home on the dog's back ,  but elmer warns the dog :   " one more scwatch and i'll give you a bath !  "  meanwhile ,  the flea is setting up dynamite on the dog ! * and that's not the end !  i noticed that in one scene ,  elmer is reading a comic book featuring bugs bunny and porky pig .  obviously ,  elmer and bugs frequently co-starred but elmer never co-starred with porky  ( unless you count the very short  " any bonds today ?  "  )  .  but to me ,  the thought of elmer reading about these other famous characters from his same genre stresses the metaphysical nature of his world ,  as though he knew of their existence within his universe even though they don't appear in this cartoon .   of course ,  i'm probably going too far in my analysis .  i'm sure that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment ,  and it certainly entertains .  as for the  " i might get to like this "  line ,  it sounds as though that was something that the censors wouldn't have allowed but somehow missed ;  i ,  for one ,  don't actually know what it was supposed to sound like .  was it something sexual ?  as for the end ,  had i thought that i'd seen everything ,  i would have been tempted to look for more ,  rather than do what the cat did  ( although it was a neat trick )  .   *the guys behind these cartoons sure had a thing for tnt ,  didn't they ? 
this film is self indulgent rubbish .  watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack .  watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed .  it should be charming but isn't - it's just irritating .  the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor .  the stories within the film are also charmless and sinister .  i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter .  it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us .   although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war .  there isn't even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it .  a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland . 
very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story ,  but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice ,  gruesome make-up effects .  daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl ,  carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13 .  nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she's the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf .  she kills her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital .  she escapes again ,  however ,  and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives ,  doctors and relatives .  it's all pretty to look at and listen too  ( really great soundtrack )  ,  but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast .  luckily enough ,  leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire .  the film is too long ,  too weird and too forgettable .  the biggest surprise comes at the end ,  when suddenly and out of the blue ,  director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts .  yeah ,  right .  .  . 
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves ,  then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie .  now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering .  her eyes are the mirror to his soul --and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are .   those who take things literally will find marleen gorris' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating .  romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded . 
if  " the cabinet of dr .  caligari "  is the father of all horror films  ( and of german expressionist cinema )  ,  this pre-wwi film is the grandfather .  the titular student ,  starving in an empty garret ,  makes a deal with the devil-- the devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold ,  in exchange for  " anything in this room .  "  the devil chooses the student's reflection in his mirror .  he walks off with the student's doppelganger ,  who commits crimes for which the student is blamed .   the film is marred by some limitations arising out of the technically primitive state of 1913 filmmaking ;  the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects ,  but the film is ,  of necessity ,  virtually all shot in shadowless daylight .  but the scene where the reflection walks out of the mirror still packs a wallop .   more interesting for the trends it fortells than for its own sake ,  the student of prague is still worthwhile . 
olivier gruner stars as jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that it's laughable .  bad acting ,  bad plot and bad fight choreography make angel town a turkey . 
despite being a huge fan of fred astaire and ginger rogers' movies ,  it wasn't until about 6 years ago that i first saw 'follow the fleet' .  i knew all the songs from an old astaire/rogers record  ( yes ,  vinyl )  but knew nothing of the plot .   unfortunately ,  while the songs are catchy and ginger rogers' character is sweet and funny ,  you just can't like 'bake baker' .  while trying to make up to his longtime partner ,  he continually sabotages her career .  his character doesn't have the usual humour and elan of the other films' astaire characters .   worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by ginger rogers . 
the quintessential georgian film of georgi danelia ,  ne goryuy  ( 1969 )  aka don't grieve is loosely based on the novel by french writer claude tillier  ( 1801-1844 )   " mon oncle benjamin "  the novel takes place in the country side of the 18th century france .  the great french revolution is still ahead but some of its stormy signs are present in society .  benjamin ,  the local doctor is a soul of a local society ,  the educated ,  friendly ,  democratic person who often treats the poor for free .  it makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account .  he is in love with a beautiful manette who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter  " his small capital "  and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed .  .  .  i never read the book ,  and from description it sounds like a charming very french novel but i am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from 18th century france to the beginning of 20th century georgia-grusiya .  i would think that it was danelia who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native georgia-grusiya ,  the land of long and wonderful traditions ,  including art of making and drinking wine ,  rare music talent that all georgians seem to possess ,  very unique humor ,  and high code of honor .  when we watched the film last night together with my husband ,  he said ,  what a great example of an art film ,  and i so agree with him .  don't grieve is a perfect art movie ,  visually beautiful ,  deep but funny ,  at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic ,  celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness ,  full of interest ,  loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters .  what is the most important ,  the film is warm and gentle ,  it does not look down at its viewers as some of the art pictures do .  you don't have to be a movie buff to love it ,  to live with it ,  to smile and sigh at it ,  to follow the good-hearted young doctor benjamin  ( first role in a danelia film of famous singer and actor wachtang kikabidze with whom danelia would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites ,  mimino )  on his journey through the roads and mountains of georgia .  or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor levan who wanted to be a guest on his own wake ,  to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive ,  and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin .  when i watched the film i thought that it is a sort of movie that federico fellini might have liked .  i was not surprised at all to find the article about danelia where he names fellini his number one director .  i also found out that according danelia ,  the famous soviet directors ,  leonid gaiday  ( the creator of many beloved comedies )  and sergei paraszhanov  ( the visionary whom i don't have to introduce loved another danelia's film ,  fairy tale about american boy huck finn ,  sovsem propashchiy )  felt and spoke negatively about don't grieve while fellini praised it highly .  i dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps maestro fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of don't grieve when he was making amrarcord in 1973 .  just a thought ,  because there is something essential that connects both films .  both artists came back to their roots ,  to the places that they love deeply ,  to the people they remembered ,  loved and wanted to honor .  both films have a lot of smiles through the tears .  both are art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers .  both are masterworks .   i think i am going to add georgi danelia to the list of my favorite directors .  he has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of dramedy ,  even tragicomedies that are funny and bitter sweet ,  poignant and subtle ,  earthy and uplifting ,  gentle and shining .  when i looked up the list of the movies he has written/directed ,  i was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in 1960 with the award winning story of a young boy ,  seryozha .  many of danelia's films are among my favorites ,  as i am sure they are among his legions of fans .  the man behind 'seryozha ,  sovsem propashchiy  ( 1972 )  which is an adaptation of mark twain the adventures of huckleberry finn ,  33 ,  ya shagayu po moskve  ( 1964 )  aka walking the streets of moscow ,  ne goryuy  ( 1969 )  aka don't grieve ,  afonya  ( 1975 )  ,  mimino  ( 1977 )  ,  osenniy marafon  ( 1979 )  aka autumn marathon or sad comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that danelia practically invented ,  and the cult favorite for over 20 years kin-dza-dza  ( 1986 )  ,  is brilliant and deserves our true love and genuine gratitude for the unforgettable moments of cinematic happiness . 
i saw this film when it was first released .  the memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years .  i didn't want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when i saw it ,  so i consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day- sentiment confirmed ,  the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent ,  indecipherable ,  and uninspiring .  a little research reveals that the producer was star leslie caron's husband ,  thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film .  the film's roster of many capable actors - caron ,  warren oates ,  scatman crothers ,  gloria grahame ,  and james sikking among others - suggests that it holds some promise .  but the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay .  the  " mystery "  implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene .  the movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller ,  but never settles upon one or the other .  the sense of suspense is entirely absent .  the main characters settle on playing dry ,  emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever .  the cinematography is pedestrian .  the result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters ,  the plot ,  and ,  in the end ,  the film itself .  i am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase .  i hope that if tcm finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the 4 : 00 am slot . 
i liked it .  .  .  just that .  .  .  i liked it ,  not like the animated series .  .  .  i love it !  !  !  .  the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate ,  but this cartoon was awesome ,  but it really didn't like it that much .  there's too much people talking about bruce being so cold ,  but if this is around 5 years later ,  anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude ,  so to me it isn't a flaw .  batgirl was awesome she really fit there ,  as there isn't more dick grayson as a robin ,  batman needed a good teammate ,  not like the new robin ,  he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child .  but heres what didn't work :  the new artwork .  .  .  it isn't horrible but .  .  .  to me it does'nt work in a series like batman .  this is a dark character ,  with a maniac killer like the joker ,  so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon ,  the joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker  ( but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond : return of the joker )   ,  so this joker isn't near as good .  the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice .  my favorite character :  harley quinn  ( im in love for her )  they put an awesome episode for her :  mad love  ( to me the best episode of this series )  .  here we finally know how she turned harley quinn ,  and how the joker twisted her mind ,  and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series ,  darker ,  no happy ending ,  brutal fight with the joker  ( but too short )  ,  this is how it was to be all the series .  but in general i didn't like how she made harley in this series .  .  .  in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way ,  she get punched ,  she say nonsenses ,  she make flaws .  .  .  c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her ,  not from her .  .  .  and here they put ridiculous  ( like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper )  so in general its a good series ,  it has it upsides and downs ,  the drawn could be better  (  my good !  !  !  kill that catwoman !  !  !  !  )  nice sound effects ,  nice music ,  nice voices and nice episodes :  my favorites ,  mad love ,  jokers millions ,  old wounds ,  sins of the father ,  and cold comfort .  if you enjoyed batman : tas you can watch this but don't spec too much ,  in the other hand if you didn't watched tas ,  watch this first and then watch tas in that way you're really gonna love tas  : d
it has been 16 years since it's original run ,  i would have hoped by now some  " marketing wizard "  would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now ,  or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes .  i can't fathom why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up .  galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots ,  and even better scripts . the animation was above average quality for it's time ,  and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today .  it predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market ,  this may have sealed it's doom too .  i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available . 
i love this movie ,  but can't get what is in this movie tht is not to like .  people who don't like this movie must be richard roeper and roger ebert .  but i can't believe that is mr .  carrey behind all that makeup .  and i am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this .  and there is a new face in the movie .  taylor momsen who plays cindy lou who .  as the opens ,  the grinch  ( jim carrey )  comes out of hiding .  and causes some mean fun to the whos in whoville .  sicne we know that the whos love christmas .  while the grinch does not like christmas .  and even makes fun of little cindy lou who  ( taylor momsen )  who is the daughter of the town's postmaster  ( bill irwin )  .  the movie was directed by ron howard .  and the narrtor's voice is done by anthony hopkins .  and jeffrey tambor  ( muppets from space )  is cast as the mayor of whoville .  who doesn't like talking about the grinch close to christmas time . 
this film illustrates the worst part of surviving war ,  the memories .  for many soldiers ,  men and women alike ,  returning home can be the beginning of real problems .  i am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from wwii .  for one of my uncles the war was never over .  he survived the d-day invasion ,  something akin to the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan .  for him the memories not only lingered but tortured him .  he became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins ,  his sons .  jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war ,  in a different country ,  the result is the same .  when i saw this at the kc filmfest ,  i was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change .  the idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in iraq ,  and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right .   the tag line from the vietnam war film platoon says it all .   " the first casualty of war is innocence .  " 
viggo mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden  ( played well by lane smith )  has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence .  lincoln kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life .  when i think prison movies ,  i always think action movies starring stallone or van damme or high caliber dramas such as shawshank redemption or the green mile .  however i didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of exorcist iii .  prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of renny harlin's career .  the movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of  ( at the time )  unknowns .  lane smith comes off the best because his warden isn't the usual cliché of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations .   *** out of 4- ( good ) 
upon the straight story release in 1999 ,  it was praised for being david lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal .  based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a john deere '66 mower ,  at first glance its an odd story for lynch to direct .  yet as the story develops you can see some of lynch's trademark motifs coming through .   lynch's focus on small town america and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as blue velvet or twin peaks ,  but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down .  the restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that i can think of that features a g rating .  incredibly significant ,  this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced .   the straight story was the first feature which lynch directed where he had no hand at writing .  for many lynch devotees this was a huge negative point .  almost universally acclaimed ,  the only overly negative review by james brundage of filmcritic . com focused on this very criticism ,  that it wasn't a typical lynch film .   " lynch is struggling within the mold of a g-rated story that isn't his own .  "  brundage claims ,  with his protagonist alvin straight  " quoting lines directly from confucious .  "  he argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse .  yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film .  whilst it is true that it is not lynch in the sense of eraserhead ,  lost highway or mulholland drive - all films which i also adore ,  the straight story features a different side of lynch that is by no means terrible .  if you are a lynch fan ,  it is most important to separate that side of lynch with this feature .   the narrative is slow and thoughtful ,  which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination .  alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife ,  children and his brother .  yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks ,  which only adds to the effect ,  which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents .  the conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch .  the natural landscapes of the us are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by angelo badalamenti ,  makes me yearn to go to america .  the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent .  his oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win .  regardless ,  however it is probably the finest swan-song for any actor .    so whilst the straight story features none of lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue ,  the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended ! 
when this film plays on television you might want to save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel .  there's nothing special here that you need to see .  story is about two married couples from arkansas who go on a trip together to reno .  couple number one is lonnie earl dodd  ( billy bob thornton )  who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage .  his wife is darlene  ( natasha richardson )  and she has a low self opinion of herself and they haven't been intimate in a long time .  lonnie has been sleeping with candy  ( charlize theron )  who is the wife of his best friend roy kirkendall  ( patrick swayze )  .  they all drive to reno and the four of them stay in one luxurious suite .  roy and candy have been trying to have a baby and finally candy discovers that she is pregnant .  but roy phones his doctor in arkansas and finds out that he's sterile .  candy and lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos .  this film is directed by jordan brady and he's made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive .  unfortunately brady doesn't show much comedic flair but you can't lay all the blame on him .  this script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level .  just because they're all from the south doesn't mean that they have to be naive and idiotic .  thornton's character doesn't have the sophistication to tip the bellboy more than a dollar .  and swayze's character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day .  penelope cruz pops up as a prostitute and it's a totally worthless and pointless cameo .  she barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines !  i think she was fulfilling an obligation to harvey and bob weinstein who are executive producers for this film .  the only person who actually isn't to bad is richardson .  we watch her become more confident in herself but this plotline in the film is very obvious and cliche .  all of these actors should know better and it's hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it .  it's a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid .  as for the viewers ,  your not getting paid so skip this one ! 
as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool ,  however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb .  even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people .  what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it .  what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale .  the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic .  the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon .  the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter ,  flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix .  dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree .  seriously ,  you just have to wonder why this movie was made ,  if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes ,  if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing ,  and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars . 
if any style of film could be called my  " guilty pleasure "  ,  it'd be this generic fantasy type .  guilty is the wrong word for it ,  though ,  as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time .   " stardust "  is good stock fantasy ,  the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman  ( or gaiman adaptation ,  as it were )  .  it isn't the visual dream-scape of mirrormask ,  it isn't the adult pretension of pan's labyrinth ,  and it isn't the fun-loving classic the princess bride ,  but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing .  fantasy lovers should rejoice--special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now .   the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who ,  in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall ,  goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star .  to make things difficult ,  however ,  tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine ,  and he's not the only one looking for her .  .  .  some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give ,  and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction .   from there it's all pretty predictable ,  but it involves some attractive fantasy elements ,  some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love ,  and the best part ,  robert deniro as a gay pirate .  on that note ,  deniro's performance is spot-on .  .  .  it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people ,  but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character  ( thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting )  .  deniro hasn't been so unique to his own image since brazil ,  and that's saying something .   stardust is the type of movie ,  perhaps ,  that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time .  i can't say it offers anything new ,  but it's not really there to .  it's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most .   --polarisdib
miike makes a children's adventure film ,  not unlike the neverending story .  it's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films .  even the worst miike is better than a good many films ,  though ,  and the great yokai war has a lot in it that's worth recommending .  it's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks .  i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it  ( the dvd includes an english dub )  ,  but ,  like all of miike's films ,  it can tend to move very slowly .  that means you've got kind of a weird unevenness ,  where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse .  the story itself isn't very good ,  either ,  and miike's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head .  most of what i liked came from the technical side of things .  this has to be miike's most expensive movie ,  and it looks fantastic .   " yokai "  are japanese spirits ,  and they come in all different ,  fantastical forms ,  and the costume designers ,  special effects crew ,  and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job .  i've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on  ( yokai monsters :  spook warfare )  ,  and the cheesy rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state-of-the-art makeup and special effects .  i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys  ( or girls ,  in this case )  ,  agi ,  who sports dark eye shadow ,  a tight ,  white outfit ,  a white beehive hairdo and a whip .  she's played ,  incidentally ,  by chiaki kuriyama ,  whom you might remember as lucy liu's teenage henchgirl in kill bill :  vol .  1 .  the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki ,  who provided voices for miyazaki's spirited away and howl's moving castle . 
this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites .  the voices for the animals are wonderful .  sally field and michael j .  fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch ,  but the real standout is don ameche as the old ,  faithful golden retriever .  this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults .  humorous and suspenseful ,  and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry !   ( happy tears !  ) 
lorna green ( janine reynaud ) is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club .  she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon .  it's quite possible that ,  through a form of hypnotic suggestion ,  someone (  .  . a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet ) is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin .  after the murders within her fantasies are committed ,  lorna awakens bewildered ,  often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality .   if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco ,  i'd say it's elegant & difficult .  by now ,  you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about ,  since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream .  franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career ,  as far as film-making style ,  and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience .  and ,  as you read from the reaction of the user comments here .  . some like this decision ,  others find the style labouring ,  dull ,  and bewildering .  i'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head ,  but even franco himself ,  when quizzed by critics who watched  " succubus "  ,  admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it !  some might say that  " succubus "  was merely a precursor to his more admired work ,   " venus in furs "  ,  considered his masterwork by franco-faithful ,  because it also adopts the surreal ,  dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined .  in a sense ,  like the protagonist ,  we are experiencing the same type of confusion .  . certainly ,   " succubus "  is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on .  and ,  a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters .   " succubus "  is also populated by beatnik types and  " poet-speak "  ,  corman's film ,   " a bucket of blood "  poked fun at .  my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party .  . quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually .  great locations and jazz score .  . i liked this film myself ,  although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction .  loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna ,  a wee bit drunk ,  writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig (  .  . equally wasted ) rush her in an embrace of kisses . 
i found myself very caught up in this movie ,  at least at the beginning ,  and any credit i give to this movie ,  is lacey chabert ,  she was fantastic !  !  but thats where it ends .  i seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is ,  and i like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me ,  but i felt out and out lied to ,  they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end ,  they gave no hit to it at all ,  thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning ,  someone did not think at all !   i felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on ,  they also seemed to not answer anything ,  why did jane ( maria )  burn down the professor's house .   its a great pity as i felt it started out as a relatively good movie . 
the documentary presents an original theory about  " guns ,  germs and steel "  .  the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory ,  and defend the theory against common criticism .   i was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series .  they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school .  indeed ,  it does .  in fact ,  i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis .   so ,  if you like knowing why things work ,  if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked ,  if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked ,  you will enjoy this series .  a definite recommendation . 
as someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years ,  i find this movie to be inspirational .  if someone with such a severe case of cp as christie brown has can do so much ,  then there's no reason that i couldn't achieve my own dreams .  daniel day-lewis and brenda fricker both give awesome performances .   
the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend .  her aunt  ( edna may oliver--a person too talented for this film )  didn't like wheeler--a sentiment i can easily relate to .  the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler .  they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king .  at about the same time ,  woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king .  so when wheeler arrived ,  it was up to the boys to fight it out ,  but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people ,  as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime .   i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s .  i have seen and reviewed hundreds ,  if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers !  despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood  ( cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey )  ,  i can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better .  for example ,  there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother's film ,  duck soup ,  yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp .  at times ,  woolsey talked a bit like groucho ,  but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny !  in fact ,  he just seemed to prattle pointlessly .  his only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film .  additionally ,  wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly !  a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as  " who's on first "  which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing .  in fact ,  soon after they started their spiel ,  they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated .  i knew that  " who's on first "  had been around for many years and used by many teams ,  but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist .   once again ,  i have found yet another sub-par film by this duo .  while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly  ( such as silly billies and the rainmakers--which i actually gave 6's to on imdb )  ,  this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey .  where was all the humor ?  ! 
this movie is deeply idiotic .  a man wants revenge for a crime- but when he enacts his revenge- there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time .  what man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera ?   just the fact that this script could never even happen except with someone unable to dress themselves destroyed it for me- but it got dumber !  !  !   i am thinking the script writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and making them miss plot holes you can drive an battalion of armored tanks through .   plot :  a man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones ,  but in the middle of the plot something goes totally wrong ,  and then the unexpected unfolds .   if only these people writing this story hadn't been so dumb as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never happen this way .  to the writers i say- seek help for your serious mental problem . 
i liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage .  it is very clean you can see it with family .  very nicely done .  songs are ok too .  i think the writer director is great .  the movie shows how marriages progress thru time .  they have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story .  some of the dialogs are quite good .  the movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization .  also shows perfect is after all not so perfect .  shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new .  the movie is very well written and directed . 
i am a huge stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that curley is in it .  done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this  ( and larry's not bad either )  .  moe's character is a straight part  ( mostly )  and this movie would be better named  " the curley and larry movie "  .  not that any of the stooges movies were very good  ( in my opinion )  ,  but as one commenter here said ,  how sad it is that this movie had real potential .  the casting was good ,  it was well directed ,  filmed ,  and edited ,  but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some stooges antics and musical numbers  ( which i guess were good back then )  thrown in .  the best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash  ( which is subject to debate )  is to wait for curley/larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it . 
tobe hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer .  like any other horror fan ,  i loved the texas chainsaw ,  but i think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title ,  you should have at least more than one hit movie .  i can't really think of any other movie hooper has done  ( on his own ,  don't count poltergeist )  that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world .  and this movie ,  night terrors ,  just backs up my point .   poor robert englund ,  i give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material he was given .  he did what he could .  as for the movie itself ?  pure drudge .  unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes ,  a story that must have been penned in an our ,  and really just awful scenery ,  music ,  and cinematography .  nothing in this film is redeemable .  don't waste your time .   overall ,  1 out of 10 .  i feel sorry for hooper ,  his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started .  i hope that he's able to pump out at least one more good flick ,  that way he can do his cult status some justice .   
having read another review ,  i thought this movie would actually be good .  i do enjoy the  " b "  movies ,  but this couldn't even be classed as such .  the photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie .  but the editing left much to be desired .  it was very choppy and staccato .  whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job .  the music was awful ,  specially anything atmospheric or scene setting .  if the acting had been better ,  they could have pulled the movie off .  unfortunately ,  i've seen better acting in porn flicks .  if you want to see a  " b "  vampire movie ,  check out 'blood ties' .  you'll be much more entertained . 
unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's slasher trend .  pretty young girls in peril .  i have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road-trip shots ,  you actually think for a second there's going to be quality in the production .  watching  " unhinged "  was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it's warm-up .  some of the most awkward ,  badly lit ,  overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a valium overdose .  i wondered why they didn't just put the cue-cards on camera so the actresses wouldn't have to constantly shift their gaze .  the two main girls were obviously chosen for their t&a factor rather than talent .  laurel munson as the main chick terry is as exciting as watching paint dry .  two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill .  janet penner and virginia settle as the crazy/creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for worst acting ever .  long pauses ,  weird expressions ,  emphasis on the wrong word ,  it's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films .  the scenes shift suddenly with long black-outs you could drive a mack truck through .  cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky .  eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer .  but ya know ,  it grew on me .  i felt sorry for it .  i wanted to hug it ,  kiss it's boo-boos and make it better .  the ending doesn't make up for the damage it's caused but i grinned anyway .  i have my own theories regarding the whole  " banned "  hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor .  otherwise pass . 
what a bad ,  bad movie !  i tried watching without fast forwarding .  .  . that failed .  after about 30 minutes i stopped the movie ,  went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was .   ( only 84 minutes ,  whew !  )  it was a confusing ,  boring movie .  i don't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one !  !  the one funny thing is that i watched  " the killer cut "  version of the movie .  the box boldly states  " more blood !  "   " more sex !  "   " more terror than the theatrical release !  "  yikes !  if this movie was horrible with all those claims i wonder just how lame the  " un-killer cut "  was ?  ?  ?  if you want to see a great movie about the world of the living & the world of the dead watch any of the night of the living dead series !  ! 
two women ,  sick of their controlling husbands ,  taking a vacation in italy for a month with two other very different women . they come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by merchant - ivory .   great scenery and the location isn't bad either .  seriously ,  a very good period piece 7 of 10
i didn't like this film at all !  first of all , i don't know why ,  but everyone here says ,  that clémence poésy's play is excellent ,  which in my opinion is absolutely wrong !  she is not like natasha :  another appearance ,  another character .  .  .  what's worse ,  she is a very unexperienced actress and that's why she wasn't able to play this role !  she disfigured the heroine completely !  that was really disgusting to watch her play !  to my mind ,  that would be much better to give this role to a russian actress ,  because that would be much easier for her to understand the russian soul for a russian person .  unfortunately ,  kutuzov looked like a drunk man ,  who hasn't shaved 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye .  .  .  (  thank's god ,  in this film there're some actors ,  whose play was awesome !  i suppose ,  that alessio boni coped with his task very well !  i was pleasantly amazed !  he is one of the few people who's read the book ,  which is very important for the play .  in addition ,  i liked plays of our russian actors ,  that was really wonderful to watch them )  )  the only thing i liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses !  my advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense ,  the aim ,  with which leo tolstoy wrote this masterpiece ,  and maybe realize the whole idea of the book .  .  .  1 from 10
with rapid intercutting of scenes of insane people in an asylum ,  and montage/superimposition of images ,  and vague ,  interwoven narratives ,  this is a very hard movie to follow .  apparently a man  ( masue inoue )  takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife ,  and maybe to rescue her .  but she's clearly mad ,  huddled on the floor ,  with a vacant expression much of the time and fear ,  misery ,  and confusion written on her face the rest of the time .  the film-maker switches to her point of view sometimes ,  and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby ,  or clutching at a drowned child .  she's tormented by something .  when the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks ,  the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things ,  showing us what mad people see and then how they react .  and the place is swarming with mad folks ,  laughing ,  hiding ,  and in one case dancing frenetically night and day .  at one point the man tries to take his wife outside ,  but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell .  gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he's interrupted in another attempt to steal her away ,  and he kills the doctor and many attendants ,  and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud .  when he wakes he is relieved ,  and mops the floor .  some fascinating shots of japanes life ,  streets ,  buildings in the 1920s . 
certainly not horrible ,  but definitely not good .   cry ,  the beloved country  ( 1995 )  was directed by darrell roodt and written for the screen by ronald harwood  ( adapted from the 1946 novel by alan paton )  .  starring james earl jones and richard harris .   the film is about pre-apartheid south africa ,  and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining .  the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo  ( james earl jones )  receives a letter from johannesburg saying that he must come immediately ;  he later finds that his son has killed a man .  the rich farmer/landowner james jarvis  ( richard harris )  finds that his son ,  a fighter for black rights ,  was the one killed by kumalo's son .  in this they connect .   i cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name ,  for i have not seen it .  or the 1974 musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it ;  both look better than this one .  but cry freedom ,  on the other hand ,  i have seen ;  it has a much more urgent air to it ,  like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry ,  the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going .  very  " wishy-washy "  .  i refuse to compare the film to the novel  ( except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film )  because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means .   frankly ,  this movie blew .  well ,  i guess it wasn't that bad ,  --five-out-of-ten ,  -- but it wasn't that good either .  both of the leads ,  both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history  ( but that can be blamed on he screenwriter ,  ronald harwood ,  who is also oddly off is game with this film ,  having also written the sublime the pianist ,  and being julia )  .  among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time ;  there is little ,  if any ,  tension with any moment of the film ,  racially or suspensefully .  the music doesn't help .  the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film .  one upside is the cinematography ,  with many rather good or great shots ,  but unfortunately ,  this does not help the film too much .   the last ,  striking words of alan paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film .  it is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown .  i don't know what nelson mandela might have seen in this film .   thanks for your time . 
loved it !  what's not to like ? --you got your suburbia ,  you got your zombies ,  you got your family issues ,  you got your social dilemmas ,  you got yourself one fine retro-1950's-style flesh eating under class held at bay by an uneasy worried about whether they're the next meal upper crust .  you couldn't ask for more .   cast is superb .  carrie ann moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife .  she's both wanton ,  and criminally conspiratorial .  every fellow's dream .  k'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence ,  and somehow succeeding .  he's a genuine screen presence .  very photogenic ,  and natural .  without naming them all ,  the rest of the cast is wonderful .  henry czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona .  billy connolly is delightful as fido .  a fine actor :  i wish that he had played the title role in  " braveheart ,  "  with gibson directing .  my sense is that his william wallace would have been closer to the actual character .  his fido is contained ,  yet accessible .  a nice touch .   in short ,  a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals ,  values ,  social pinnings ,  feelings ,  growth ,  coping in uncertain times ,  and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions .  a true reality show . 
as an actor i really like independent films but this one is amateur at best .   the boys go to vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in vermont ?  pines yes - palms no .  and the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees .   when the boys are leaving vt they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is federal express .  did they ship themselves overnight in a crate ?  come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur .   the christian brother is far gayer than arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo .  the two should have switched roles .   the minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible .   applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
mina kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing ,  to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies .  the director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible .  the music and dancing is of the highest possible quality .  you may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background : other girl dancing ,  a drunk falling down stairs ,  much activity ,  but he knew that we would be watching mina dance and i'll bet unless you viewed this many times ,  you didn't notice . all in all ,  perfection . j . q . 
this wretched movie shows that not even some of gollywood's best can salvage a true landfill deposit .  .   i could spend much time describing everything that was bad about this effort ,  but that would require more time and i've already wasted 91 minutes watching .  .  . it .   looking at it now ,  after brando's death ,  shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors had become .   donald sutherland ?  why ?    i have to fill more lines to get this accepted .  i have to fill more lines to get this accepted .  i have to fill more lines to get this accepted .   don't waste your time with this movie .  i'm overdue to do something interesting .  bye . 
wow !  i remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s .  they usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students .  as i watched this film i felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s .  however ,  then i find out that this film was made in 1989 ?  say what !  well ,  the nostalgia factor ends right there ,  this is just bad .  the plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools .  which is odd ,  in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant .  in fact ,  the main character lives in a mansion .  makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive ,  have they never heard of property taxes .  oh ,  but here is the kicker .  the school board says that they will keep the school alive ,  if the students can raise $200 , 000 .  so the seniors go about doing this .  hmmm ,  you raise $200 , 000 but instead of saving that for college ,  you put it towards saving the high school that you are a senior in ?  and why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out ?  and .  .  . ahh forget it ,  this film was stupid and made in 1989 !  ? 
spoilers i guess .    the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie .  i just couldn't get over it .  and what is wrong with mark wahlberg's character ?  if i suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes ,  i'd be all like ,   "  aaaahhhhhhh !  !  !  run for your lives !  the monkeys have inherited the earth !  "  but he's all like ,   " talking apes ,  okay .  next ?  "  that's pretty jaded i'd say .  he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis .  besides that ,  this is rick baker's best work yet .  this film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field .  3/10 . 
why do i constantly do this to myself ?  i mean ,  really ,  it's right there in the title -  " the incredible melting man "  .  what else would i expect ?  i have to admit ,  i'm a sucker for just about anything i come across on the monster hd channel ,  but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary rick baker .  as for creepy ,  i'll give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out .  now they were truly scary .   something i could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monster's victims wouldn't simply just run away when faced with virtual annihilation .  like the chick in the cabin .  you know ,  there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time .  incredible steve-o couldn't muster much more than a brisk walk ,  so why not just blow right by him ?  i don't know ,  maybe i'm missing something .    this flick had some of the feel of a 'tales from the crypt' episode ,  but 'tales' usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you didn't see coming .  this was one picture that you couldn't quite get a handle on coming or going .  for example ,  in an early scene ,  you can clearly make out that melting man's eyeball fell out of his head ,  so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story ?  i guess we're not supposed to ask .   at eighty four minutes ,  this picture was about an hour and a half too long .  when it was all over ,  i was ready to take up general perry on his earlier suggestion -  " i could really use a drink about now "  . 
baseketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier , comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny , and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v . s the evil rich guy . the one and only thing i didnt like about baseketball , was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie , but , if the kid wasnt in the movie , some of the funny scenes wouldnt have existed . if you have read any pro reviews about this movie , exclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film . baseketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want . 8 out of 10 . 
i saw this movie at the edmonton international film festival ,  with the great dr .  uwe boll in attendance .   the film is ,  simply put ,  very ,  very bad .  and no ,  not in the usual uwe boll  " so bad it's actually entertaining "  way ,  but just plain bad .  the plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life  ( because of a past criminal record ,  apparently )  ,  can't get a job ,  and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife .  this man turns to his cult-leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus .  al qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys ,  and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence .   the acting is awful  ( except for dave foley ,  who really tries ,  despite it all )  ,  the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion ,  and people taking a poo .  it's supposed to be satire ,  but i'm not sure of what .   think  " airplane !  "  ,  but done by the creators of south park ,  and without any jokes . 
dear dear dear dear dear .  .  . me !  i had the strength to see it through .  .  .  but why ?  !   the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good .  but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing .  this was some kind of tremors for kids .  i can't believe this movie was made at all .  . seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind  ( for kids )  and they just did whatever they could with it .   what audience is this movie for ?  i can only think of 12-14 year olds .  if you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie .  it's not only slow ,  but it's so utterly boring .  the characters are overacted  ( not just a little either )  and so stereotyped it's fun for a while .  . but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen .  you know everything that is going to happen too ,  cause yes .  .  . you've seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids .  i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced .  it's so bad .  . so wrong .  . so .  .  . crap .   but ok ,  we did get a laugh now and then .  not just at the silly plot holes ,  but some scenes where worth a replay or two .  .  . or one scene that is ,  where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys .  . it's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly .  still makes me grin when i think about it .  but that only happened one more time sadly .  . and that's when the  " badass "  gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully .  .  . that and one comment  " they spring from the ground like some demonic trout !  "  at this point we where almost crying with laughter .  but after that .  . nothing could ever top that .  .  (  ?  )  .  . so it's pretty much downhill from there .    so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting .  if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie .  .  . he's either a  " plant "  ,  vegetable or someone very evil .  this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far .  looking forward to seeing tremors 3 ,  it's bound to be box office hit compared to this .  .  . this .  .  . *goosebumps* no .  . i'll leave it at that . 
i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch .    they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team .   another scene is like during their failure at the simulation ,  kevin gets joaquin to clam down .   i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff .   otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff .   the dvd i have watched feels edited for television . 
carlo verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism .   then something happened ,  and he turned into just another dull  " holier-than-thou "  director .   il mio miglior nemico can more or less be summarized in one line  " working class = kind and warm ,  while upper-class = snob and devious .  but love wins in the end "  .   such a trite clichè for such a smart director .   there isn't really too much to talk about in the movie .  every character is a walking stereotype :  the self-made-man who forgets his roots but who'll become  " good "  again ,  the scorned wife ,  the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest-but-poor guy .  .  .  acting is barely average .   severely disappointing under every aspect . 
what an unusual movie .   absolutely no concessions are made to  " hollywood special effects "  or entertainment .  there is no background music ,  not special effects or enhanced sound .   facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire .   i sort of viewed these movies  ( parts 1 and 2 )  as an educational experience ,  not really something to go and get entertained by .  its quite long and in places dull .   but i suspect that given the lack of any plot development ,  i don't think its very educational either .   its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening ,  since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why che's band was moving around the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at .   i would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character ,  but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end .  the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare . 
americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial ,  we tend to lose interest really fast .   i found out an exciting fact from this film :  someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule !  and guess what ,  they really would like to be doing something else  ( the viewer has similar feelings )  .   surprisingly ,  when i was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film ,  i found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging .   i just don't usually watch that much late night tv ,  so i can't recommend this film ,  unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life . 
 " the garden of allah "  is a prime example of  " popular women's literature "  ,  turn of the xxth century style ,  combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of catholic guilt .  just as jane eyre couldn't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins ,  or the heroine of  " rebecca "  couldn't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife  ( and her castle burned down around her )  ,  or poor psyche couldn't leave well enough alone and had to extract cupid's secret at all costs ,  domini ,  the devout catholic heroine of this piece of tripe ,  can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows .  like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours ,  this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book :  basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late .  the logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act .  it is paul claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards .  oh well .  .  .  it could have been much worse and it often was .  .  .   without the religious overtones ,  the film's plot is that of your basic porn flick :  oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic ,  shapely but naive catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery ,  all passion spent ,  leaving her to clean up his mess .  and i really resent another commentator's comparison with anatole france's  " thais "  ,  a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of catholic sexual repression ,  some of which transpired in massenet's opera of the same name ,  thankfully .   but what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism ,  of course ,  is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering ,  vibrant life .  imperishable technicolor photography that will outlive us all ,  a truckload of worthy character actors  ( including one cute dog )  ,  a music score by max steiner that seems determined to accomplish the  " composed film "  that michael powell  ( who ,  ironically ,  had a bit part in the 1927 silent version )  always dreamed about ,  tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic ,  operatic exoticism ,  a dream-like atmosphere where material considerations are no object ,  characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next ,  dialog is sparse ,  vague and suggestive ,  the art direction is close to celestial ,  flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent ,  the heroine's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats ,  saints ,  doomed but horny sinners ,  mystics or poets .   ahh .  .  .  hollywood !  the mgm dvd presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable .  the bit rate is very high throughout ,  the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2 . 0 mono sound truly does justice to max steiner's score and to boyer's penultimate confession .   a historical note on this sort of  " women's subject "  :  the following year  ( 1937 )  ,  julien duvivier ,  visibly inspired by  " the garden of allah "  ,  directed  " carnet de bal "  ,  where a very similar clothes-horse butter-won't-melt-in-her-mouth heroine  ( widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic alpine lakeside villa )  wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book .  she finds them all in time ,  only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood ,  overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences .  it was duvivier's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later . 
there seem to have been any number of films like this released during the 70's .  and the fact that i cannot recollect the title to a single one of them off-hand is a measure of their impact .  these are what novelists would call 'pot-boilers' .  they are scarcely more than a vehicle for keeping movie-stars in the public eye .   we have micheal caine ,  peter ustinov ,  omar sharif ,  rex harrison and william holden ;  more than enough names to get bums on cinema seats .  every taste in hero is catered for .  though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed .   their talents are simply thrown away ,  and i wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense .  this sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a cv .  sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round .   it was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset .  that ludicrously mismatched jaunty-jazz theme music ,  which also percolated up every time some incidental noise is needed ,  had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator muzak .  who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central africa ,  or the endless sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop ?  definitely a serious goof-ball .  ennio morricone would have known what to do ;  and his results would have oozed enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points .  this director should have taken the trouble to watch 'lawrence of arabia' ,  or even sergio leone's westerns ;  he might have learnt a few things .  but then again ,  probably he wouldn't .   alfred hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film 'frantic' .  it was later remade with equal panache staring harrison ford .  in each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible .  here ,  when michael caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and bravado ,  rex harrison kept popping-up out of no-where like some wily old genii ,  to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled .    at least the photography was rather good ,  with excellent use of the often beautiful environment .  but then the dumb music must pipe-up and blow to atoms what little ambiance this created .   action scenes were also contrived and stilted ,  with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a first-year drama class .  and ,  of course ,  the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment - as you do .   and that's about as much comment as this item deserves .  except to say that the script was pretty wretched as well .   stick with your hobby on this one .  even if it contained your favourite movie-stars ,  you're sure to be disappointed too . 
in carmen ,  saura once again seeks to establish a dynamic rapport between reality and fiction ,  between the actual passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance portions of the opera carmen and the scripted passions from the story of the fictional carmen ,  the famous fatal mix of a free spirit  ( read disregard for fidelity )  and her ability to drive men mad with desire .  saura used this same vehicle fiction/reality in an earlier black-and-white film ,  bodes de sangre  ( blood wedding )  .  but ,  whereas the tensions between the dancers rehearsing blood wedding showed to advantage how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed through directing their emotions into their roles ,  in carmen ,  the parallel between the petty ,  libidinal urges of the dancers of the troop during rehearsals and the spirit forging to do with the mythic carmen never comes even close to being believable .  it remains a gadget ,  and ,  for that reason ,  a bothersome distraction .  one really needs to see blood wedding next to carmen to appreciate the comparison .  however ,  it hardly matters ,  the melodrama saura tries to impose upon his carmen ,  because the flamenco dancing and guitar music of the rehearsals_ which are 95% of the film _by some of the best known flamenco dancers and musicians ,  more than repays the price of entry .  a flawed film ,  and a wonder :  perfect for doing a drill in keats's 'negative capacity' ,  perhaps ? 
i am a big fan of arnold vosloo .  finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie ,  not just a bit part ,  made me happy .   unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos .   i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired ,  but arnold is an excellent actor ,  i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired .   i love arnold vosloo ,  and he made the film viewable .  otherwise ,  i would have written it off as another lousy film .   i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary ,  but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good .  but the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad .  there are some glitches in the film  ( continuity )  but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film .   all in all i enjoyed the film ,  because arnold vosloo was in it .   jackie
this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny .  when i saw this film ,  i saw it for john candy and assumed ,  incorrectly ,  that it would be hilarious .  instead ,  there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat ,  unfunny moments .  and ,  to top it off ,  candy delivered some of the crudest lines i had ever heard up to that time .  so ,  despite a potentially funny cast and story idea ,  we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult ,  though teens will probably find a few laughs .  it's really a shame--it could have been so much better .  i mean ,  with eugene levy ,  joe flaherty and john candy it should have been wonderful . 
super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd / bigscreen / 5 . 1 channel sound system .  the imax camera puts you right in the race car ,  where you cruise around various tracks at high speed ,  reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix  ( if only that would appear on dvd !  )  .  i enjoy watching it again and again .   the only minus ,  and why i didn't give it a 10 ,  is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up .  the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine .  you won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges . 
i only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it .  a group of tourists ,  supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada ,  run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other ,  and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes ands wrong turn .  only problem is ,  unless i miscounted ,  there's only one mutant on display ,  and he isn't all that impressive .  sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago .  some gory but silly deaths help ,  but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief .  the ending is predictable and has been done to death .  no pun intended . 
i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue ,  but was pleased to find a fast-paced script ,  an underlying moral ,  excellent portrayals from all the actors ,  especially peter finch ,  amazing special effects ,  suspense ,  and beautiful cinematography--there's even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban .  not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic ,  before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work .  all the supporting players round it out ,  and i do wonder who trained all those elephants .   speaking of the stone-buddha sequence ,  you really can discern that it's vivien leigh in the long shots .  her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor's .  the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots ,  where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk .   if you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring ,  spend a few hours with elephant walk . 
i've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt it .   the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg's expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg ,  oprah winfrey ,  danny glover ,  and margaret avery .  akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettie .   you'll experience every human emotion while watching this film .  i laughed ,  cried ,  and got angry .  like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins .  but this movie ,  without a doubt ,  is definitely one of the best films of all time . 
director/star clint eastwood's  " sudden impact "  is an intriguing addition to the  " dirty harry "  series - a combination of crude film-making and genius .  it's mediocre and silly in parts ,  brilliant and classic in others ,  with compelling ,  gripping pacing .  there are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up  " make my day "  scene recalls the  " do you feel lucky "  one ,  one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's scorpio ,  an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harry's partner - just to name a few .   harry callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department ,  still mean ,  still tough ,  but now he's older and wearier .  his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice ,  the two things not always being compatible .  this  " incompatibility "  is the underlying theme of the series .  the first film posed a simple question ,   " what about the victim's rights ?  "  -  ( do they outweigh those of the criminal ?  vice versa ?  depends ?  )  .  that film's answer was controversial ,  prompting a sequel  ( the highly enjoyable  " magnum force "  )  which set out to draw the line between harry's brand of justice and pure ,  heartless vigilantism .  dirty harry ,  like many of clint's other roles ,  is the personification of vengeance ,  the protector of the the defenseless .  this movie however brings it back to the victim ,  in this case jennifer  ( portrayed by sondra locke )  ,  who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men  ( and one woman )  who committed the crime .   without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie ,  i will say this - i mentioned earlier that  " sudden impact "  echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series  ( the confusion concerning the captain's last name is an example - an intentional prank ,  i believe )  .  the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante ?  and is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights ?  the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series ,  one which i personally  ( as a fan )  found quite moving .  that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the  " dirty harry "  collection ,  the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film .   ( not to knock  " the dead pool "  - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan ,  rather than a character-defining film like this one )  .   this movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the reagan era found harry and his ilk quite appealing ,  and the president himself frequently quoted  " go ahead ,  make my day .  " 
by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over ,  as films were moving in a different direction ,  comedically and otherwise .  with television looming on the horizon ,  hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time .  where ,  one wonders ,  would movies have gone had television not come along ,  or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years ?  mr .  blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed .   ad man jim blandings ,  along with his wife and two daughters ,  are living in a nice but way too cramped new york city apartment ,  as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs .  so he buys some property in connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications .  well ,  almost .  had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind .  then again he might not have .  you decide .  on this frail premise a wonderful film results ,  full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one .  nothing comes easy in this life ,  as mr .  blandings learns ;  but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way .  there is ,  after all ,  the long run .  but ,  blandings asks himself every few minutes ,  how long is long ?   this movie is a delight .  it is not ,  i suppose ,  a masterpiece in the capra-mccarey tradition ,  but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures ,  and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically .  there is real warmth in the picture ,  and a good deal of  ( w . c .  )  fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically ,  but not so much as to leave a bad taste .  the people in the film are all very smart and affluent ,  but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class .   lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr .  and mrs .  blandings to perfection ;  while melvyn douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend ,  who often has to bring up unpleasant topics ,  such as how the real world works .  there is ,  too ,  a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia ,  which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years ,  as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place .  these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural connecticut .  in a few short years things would change ,  as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear ,  destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns ,  which soon would be connected by highways ,  littered with bottles and cans ,  their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city . 
i probably give this more credit than it deserves because it's halloween ,  i was just at  " knott's scary farm "  and i was in a mood to watch a really cheesy halloween movie .   oh ,  and it only cost me one dollar .   usually i'll ffwd through a movie like this to get to  " the good stuff ,  "  but i resisted the urge here and i'm still not sure why .  it was obvious from the opening shots this wasn't a  " real "  movie ,  not even a b-movie .  it's more in the category of the decoteau  " horror "  movies like  " the brotherhood "  that are shot on film-look video for about 50 cents  ( in fact ,  i was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something )  .  there were no cutaway shots  ( too expensive to do multiple camera setups )  and flat lighting but .  .  . it's hard to pinpoint .  there's something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a half-decent movie .  the fact that he's doing even a half-decent job is commendable ,  and this movie has it's share of merits--the acting isn't bad ,  the photography is pretty good  ( if too bright to be scary )  ,  there are some surprises ,  and the whole thing is sort of .  .  . different somehow .   a bunch of college kids are  ( for some unknown reason )  stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house .  a creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell .  this results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be ,  and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering .  along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplot--it's interesting that this couple seems to be the most well-rounded in the movie .  yes ,  there's a sex scene but it isn't salacious--or at least no more so than you'd find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex .  it's rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation .    the other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the  " stupid kids have sex and get killed "  vibe of the 80's slashers .  it's hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist ,  the genre has been done to death .  i'm not sure if it's good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre ,  without irony ,  as if it was still a living genre ,  but i appreciated the attempt .   which is why i sat through it ;  sometimes you just want to watch a mindless ,  no-budget ,   " a-for-effort "  horror film .  there really was too much set up ,  not enough gore ,  endless plot-holes ,  dead-ends and clichés and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisioned .  .  . but at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool .  i'd pay to go to that haunted house if it existed ,  and didn't mind paying a dollar to see it on dvd even if i'll never watch this again .   oh ,  and **possible spoiler** ,  but there was great ,  brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin :   " i used to be claustrophobic .  but i've changed .  "  ha ha ,  good one . 
i own 2 home entertainment stores and i've seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it .  how bad was it ?  let's just say that sofia coppola deserved an oscar for her performance in godfather iii when compared to giada colagrande's in this movie .   it was robotic and uninspired .  her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the 'rubber house' he had given her .  once there ,  she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her .  within a day ,  she starts a relationship with leslie ,   ( dafoe )  the caretaker of the house .  even though she is married to dafoe off screen ,  her scenes with him were cold and unemotional .   if there was a plot ,  i missed it .  not even willem dafoe could save this movie from the amateur ,  cinematic train wreck that it is . 
ok ,  the story - a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is mildly interesting one .  anyway ,  ideas are nothing  ( everyone has some .  .  .  )  - the execution is everything .   this is what bothered me with this flick .  and it did bother me immensely .  the rhythm  ( directing ,  editing )  was slow ,  the pace was uneven and the climax expected .  we have seen those frigging highways five ,  six ,  seven times - why ?  norton character's troubles were seen as a childish game ,  not enough deep to understand his problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him .  is he a coward ,  a manipulator or just a loony ?  references to the  " taxi driver "  were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick  ( or to e . n .  for that matter )  .   and imho ,  it is cowardly executed at the end .  cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in mid america .  this guy should have killed the kid ,  blamed the father ,  create a real havoc .  or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc .  ,  but no ,  we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony ,  the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony ,  of course ,  dies .  the happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed ,  safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop-corns ,  undisturbed .   and that scene where the loony enters the movie ,  oh my god ,  i would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that !  you do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew .  creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying .  again ,  if you're a 16 years old girl somewhere in kansas nowhere or whatever-where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age ,  ok ,  then you might enjoy this movie and its  " message "  . 
this has to be the worst film i have ever seen .  i bought the dvd and it didn't work ,  well the dvd worked fine ,  its just the film didn't ,  in fact its so bad that i think non of the actors have worked since  ( or before judging from the acting )  .  there is no real plot to speak of and no real horror .  the production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone .   all in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didn't know any better  ( which have been an improvement )  .  there are only two lines in the film that are funny ,  both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute .   ( although they hardly merit watching all 76 minutes for )   as for the marketing of the dvd i feel thoroughly cheated .  i mean reading the back i expected it to be bad :   he chose his weapons .  he selected his victims .  he picked his nose .  he turned into a girl !   but i thought it might be funny .  also the case claims it is digitally re mastered ,  i would love to have seen it beforehand ,  the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper .  the case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie ,  in what way ?  ,  disgusting production ,  acting .   this film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes ,   ( if you are considering buying this i would say buy `bad taste' instead it is a much better film and is funny ,  also it has peter jackson the director of the lotr in it .  )   incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors  ( or director patrick j mathews )  and what they have done since ,  please post here as i would love to know ,  purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there ,  or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act
this sweeping drama has it all :  top notch acting ,  incredible photography ,  good story .  it is often compared to  " braveheart "  because both movies take place in historical scotland .  even though i love braveheart ,  i think this is the better of the two films .  jessica lange gave an incredible performance  ( should have been nominated for an oscar )  .  liam neeson is fantastic in the title role .  tim roth plays one of the most evil ,  despicable ,  characters in film history  ( he was nominated for an oscar )  .  john hurt is excellent as lord montrose ,  another dislikeable character .  i am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play .  this is a story of a dispute over money between rob roy and his clan ,  and lord montrose .  rob roy is a self made man ,  who will not solve his problems with montrose if it violates his sense of honor .  montrose ,  who ,  inherited his title ,  has no sense of honor .  and that is basically what this story is all about ;  honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility .  this movie is very entertaining ,  it should appeal to all .  it has romance ,  action ,  beautiful scenery ,  and has a exciting plot .  one of my favorite films . 
 " steve "  ( chris hoffman ) gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother wes went missing .  while they are there ,  a reptilian creature in the shape of a man ( reminded me a lot of the gillman from creature from the black lagoon ) awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one .  a biker ,  ellen ripley-type time female bad-ass ,  kat ( chase masterson ) has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in ,  while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage .  kat knows more than she's telling ( she also suffered the loss of a child )  ,  but there's another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of .  this creature might just be more human than they realize .  . and it's former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since wes' death .  kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin .   thankfully ,  a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it's eyes .  the film has dawson's creek-type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie .  the direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scares .  the cast is rather life-less and uninteresting .  pretty maggie grace ( the fog remake )  might be the only draw for this film . 
 " this story is dedicated to women ,  "  according to the introduction ,   " who have been fighting for their rights ever since adam and eve started the loose-leaf system .  "  when  " politics "  was filmed ,  the nineteenth amendment ,  guaranteeing women the right to vote ,  was only a decade old .  and ,  the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group .  advocating prohibition ,  and shutting down speakeasies ,  was a main concern for women at the time .   good-natured marie dressler  ( as hattie burns )  becomes politically active ,  after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy .  she wants the liquor-selling joints closed ;  and ,  is drafted into a mayoral run ,  after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally .  ms .  dressler is supported by her tenants ,  best friend polly moran  ( as ivy higgins )  and her stuttering husband roscoe ates  ( as peter higgins )  .  dressler's run for mayor of lake city draws opposition from men in town ;  so ,  dressler orders the women to go on strike ,  denying them ,   " everything "  in the  " parlor ,  bedroom ,  and bath .  "    the film sounds much better than it turned out .  the humor ,  frankly ,  isn't too good ;  and ,  it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations  (  " you look like madame queen "  refers to an amos and andy character )  .  and ,  the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well ,  this time .  producers might have considered making the film more dramatic ,  focusing exclusively on dressler and the characters played by william bakewell  ( as benny emerson )  and karen morley  ( as myrtle burns )  .   **** politics  ( 7/25/31 )  charles reisner ~ marie dressler ,  polly moran ,  roscoe ates
gundam wing is a fun show .  i appreciate it for getting me into gundam and anime in general .  however ,  after watching its predecessors ,  such as mobile suit gundam ,  zeta gundam ,  and even g gundam ,  i find wing to be gundam lite .   characters :  an aspect long held by gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity .  this does not happen in wing .  heero is top dog at the beginning ,  and he's top dog at the end .  personalities do not change ,  growth is never achieved .  the best character is zechs ,  who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series .  but suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason .   mecha :  wing has great suit designs .  the gundams are super cool ,  with the epyon being my favorite .  i even consider a few of the oz suit designs to be on par with some of the classic zeon suits .  but sweet suit designs doesn't quite save the series from boring characters .   conclusion :  in the end ,  wing has cool fight scenes ,  though riddled with recycled animation ,  but shallow plot and character development .  enjoyable ,  but not moving like previous gundam outings . 
yikes .  this is pretty bad .  the play isn't great to begin with ,  and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as peploe doesn't decide how she wants to treat the material's theatrical origins  ( we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc .  )  and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you're watching a film ,  whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material .  mira sorvino's central performance is breath-takingly poor :  stage-y and plummy ,  it's as if she's playing the part via helena bonham-carter's merchant ivory oeuvre .  only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but it's hard to watch a film for one performance alone ,  even if that performance is as light ,  truthful and entire as shaw's .  ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn ,  and diana rigg's daughter ,  rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that .  sadly ,  none of bertolucci's magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence . 
this movie was not so much promoted here in greece , even though it got good actors  ,  great script and rather good photograph was not a so called  " blockbuster "  movie in my country .  the movie itself is very powerful , it's about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home-village after been released from a 5yo prison time ( drugs )  the end is rather sad .  .  .  .  mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well .  .  .  lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency .  .  .  7 out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression ! 
well ,  what was fun .  .  .  except for the fun part .   it's my second least favorite so far ,  i even thought it was worse than 'lazarus' and 'ghost in the machine' .   let's start with the good .  the teaser ,  it was incredibly well done and also emotional .  being the great animal lover that i am ,  it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode .   but then there's all the bad ,  and believe me there is a lot of it .  little made sense ,  so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated ?  whaaa ?  ?  ?  the dialog was also pretty awful .  there were about one or two quotable lines .    and worst of all ,  having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me .  in the end .  .  .  what's the point ?  they all pretty much died .  we didn't learn anything ,  we weren't entertained ,  and i couldn't even find sophia's death sad .  .  .  just very frustrating .   * star .  shame because season 2 was doing so well . 
nominated for the oscar  " worst script ever "  in my opinion .  there's no decent story ,  rediculous acting ,  very lousy humor .  by every means possible ,  if you have little self respect please don't waste your time seeing this movie .  although u can see the actors can act ,  it leaves you dumber after watching it .  precious braincells are being killed watching this crap .  .  .   i warned u  don't see this movie
this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen ,  and i have quite an appetite for awful  ( and good )  movies .  it could  ( just )  have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue-in-cheek --à la rocky horror picture show ,  which was really very funny .  other movies ,  like plan nine from outer space ,  manage to be funny while  ( apparently )  trying to be serious .  as to the acting ,  it looks like they rounded up brain-dead teenagers and asked them to ad-lib the whole production .  compared to them ,  tom cruise looks like alec guinness .  there was one decent interpretation -- that of the older ghoul-busting broad on the motorcycle . 
paul armstrong is a liberal ,  scottish-born ,  professor of law at harvard ,  known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty ,  who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl ,  a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver ,  an eleven year old white girl .  earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan ,  a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders .  armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row ,  hoping to persuade him to confess to joanie's murder ,  thereby saving earl from the electric chair .    at first all goes well .  sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction .  as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film ,  it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer .   " warning !  major plot twist ahead !  "  and so it proves .  the anticipated twist soon materialises .  earl ,  it transpires ,  is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted ,  and probably of several others as well ,  but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom ;  sullivan will confess to joanie's murder if earl will murder his parents .   ( just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained )  .  armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved ;  earl has a grudge against armstrong's wife ,  herself a lawyer ,  who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape .     " just cause "  is an example of the auto-cannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge ,  cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others .  the first half owes an obvious debt to films like  " intruder in the dust "  and  " to kill a mockingbird "  ;  about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black ,  whereas in earlier films he would have been white .   ( police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity )  .  the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costa-gavras's  " music box "  ,  although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end .  the finale ,  in which a lawyer ,  his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client ,  is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of  " cape fear "  ,  which also take place in the swamplands of the american south .  ed harris' characterisation of sullivan as a bible-quoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niro's character in the scorsese version of  " cape fear "  ,  made four years before  " just cause "  .     ( there is a postscript .  just as  " just cause "  borrowed heavily from several other movies ,  seven years later its central plot twist was ,  in its turn ,  to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle  " high crimes "  )  .    the trouble with this style of film-making-by-numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them .  the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts ,  and  " just cause "  is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it .  harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances ,  largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady .  blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the  ( supposedly )  innocent young man of the early scenes ,  but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones .  sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better ,  but neither is good enough to save the film .   ( connery and harris were to act together in another ,  better ,  film ,   " the rock "  ,  the following year )  .    there is another problem with  " just cause "  .  the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal  " issue "  movie ,  anti-death penalty ,  anti-racist and critical of heavy-handed policing .  the second half looks more like the work of a die-hard reactionary ,  preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards ,  that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair ,  that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes .  the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the  ( presumably unwanted )  effect of reversing its political stance ,  or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it .  a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency .  4/10
**spoilers** a bit ridicules made for tv movie has sexy and middle age gold-digger isabelle collins ,  susan tucci , doing a number on every man she comes in contact with in the movie .  first winning over their hearts then their wallets and then ,  when their no longer any use to her ,  thrown in the wastepaper basket like a used up kleenex tissue .   isabelle's first victim is non other then her abusive ,  on keeping isabelle from raiding his bank account ,  husband stewart ,  john o'hurley .  it's later in the movie when isabelle gets very friendly with former plumber and now yacht salesman richard davis ,  philip casnoff ,  that she ,  without really telling him ,  has the totally love-sick richard get a contract out on her unsuspecting husbands life .  getting this ex-convict ,  in fact as soon as he's released from prison ,  daggett ,  nicholas campbell ,  to do the job on stewart richard soon finds out that he didn't get exactly what he paid ,  $15 , 000 . 00 in cash , for .   getting a little too greedy daggett not only blew stewart's brains out but took a solid gold watch ,  that stewart offered him in order to spear his life ,  as well .  the watch was easily traced to daggett as he tried to pawn it at a local jewelry shop where he was quickly arrested .  with doggett spilling his guts out on who hired him to whack stewart it doesn't take long for the long arm of the law to arrest stewart's ,  by hiring doggett ,  killer isabelle's husband to be ex-plumber and yacht salesman richard davis !  davis' arrest by the police happens just as he and isabelle took the vows of matrimony in a local church !   isabelle manipulates everyone ,  exclusively men that fall head over heels for her ,  to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work .  always playing the part of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client isabelle seems to live a charmed life always one step ahead of the law and police .  no matter what she does isabelle covers her pretty behind so well that it's almost impossible to pin her down on any ,  in having others do them ,  of the many crimes that she commits ,  through a second party ,  in the film .   after screwing ,  figuratively as well as literally ,  her first husband steven her second husband ,  for less then ten seconds ,  richard and finally her ,  or richard's ,  attorney gavin kendrick ,  kamar de los rey ,  isabelle knows that it's only a matter of time before the police get wise to her .  with the d . a getting both richard and kendrick to turn evidence against her isabelle now knowing that everything is fast closing in on her makes her final move .  getting everything in order ,  by transferring all her cash overseas ,  isabelle and her 10 year-old daughter ruby ,  lauren collins ,  shoot down to the passport office in order to get clearance ,  passports ,  to get out of the country .   it's then when the cagey and clever isabelle makes her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the movie .  isabelle is told by the passport clerk ,  don carrier ,  she'll have to wait a full 48 hours for her ,  and ruby's ,  passport to clear !  just enough time for the police to find and arrest her !  outlandish ending that goes against almost everything and every ethic that's in a film noir or crime movie .  an ending that will not only blow your mind but your concept of what's right and wrong in the world ! 
i first read the book ,  when i was a young teenager ,  then saw the film late one night .  about a year ago i checked it out on imdb and discovered no copies available .  i then hit the web and found a site that offers war films ,  soooo glad that i did ,  ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why i wanted to see it again .   in my opinion to really enjoy the film i suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film .  the book is no longer in print but i did track a copy down via e-bay ,  the author alan white was a commando/paratrooper during the 2nd world war taking part in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book .  it is written by someone who knows and this fact i believe gives the book and film authenticity .  i have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film ,  not as good as the book .  there are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book also ,  which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war .  the film illustrates this exceptionally well .  i have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch ,  in that order .   if you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and i only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see ,  one of my all best war films ,  ever ! 
i have seen bad films but this took the p*** .  made no sense ,  and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds ,  oh and i think one has a low sperm count .  its that good .  a welshman plays a sweary cockney .  a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy ,  and some lesser lights play dim tarts .   and there are some russian gangsters .  oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs .   avoid this film like the plague . 
i rented this movie this past weekend ,  cranked up the surround sound system ,  and got some great sound from special affects .  this movie is a great movie rental ,  the special affects where enough to scare my fiance ,  but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated .  i didn't go to the movies and see this ,  but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie .  i would recommend it ! 
caught this by accident on a t . v .  showing - and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was .  by comparison ,  the original  " a man called horse "  was spell-binding because it held one's interest throughout .  but this piece of nonsense - words fail me .  it was bad enough to have some kind of a  " story "  presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread ,  but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so-called  " sioux "  spoke .  for goodness sake ,  couldn't the film-makers have found enough north american indians who were also actors and near-actors to perform as  " indians "  in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used ?  i also found it quite embarrassing watching richard harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera ,  telling him to run and jump from pointless point a to pointless point b just to make up film footage and minutes .  absolutely terrible in all respects ! 
well ,  they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied .  i don't know if stella james  ( sean young )  qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac ,  but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men .  she's still exploring ,  trying to find  " more data "  so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it ,  though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now .   ( i can't agree ,  however ,  with anyone who says young is too old for the role .  if she is ,  we should all age so nicely .  )  for the most part this film left me cold ,  though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see .  and unlike the recent 'eyes wide shut , ' at least something happens in this one . 
was it a thriller ,  as i thought when i saw the cover at the video library ?  no .  was it a 'food fr thought' as the author was maybe trying to make it ?  not really .  so what was it ?  it was a very average movie ,  that had great potential ,  and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points ,  beginning middle and end ,  with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy ,  who although he seemed overzealous at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall .  it was nice cinematography ,  with good colours ,  cool hi-tec stuff ,  beautiful scenics but leaves you lost about where it's going and where it has just been .  and with a feeling of let's just quickly wrap it up in the end .  ok to watch if there's nothing else on tv . 
doppelganger has its moments ,  but they are few and far between .   essentially ,  this is a grade b blend of pop-psych thriller ,  ghost story and horror .  drew barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past  ( most of her family has been murdered and she was ,  in at least one case ,  the prime suspect )  ,  or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder ?  george newbern is her new room mate ,  and most of the action centers on him .   newbern's character is pretty sympathetic ,  and both he and barrymore do decent work  ( though not exactly good )  .  the mediocre to  ( at times )  totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion .  leslie hope's character is memorable ,  but so irritating that you will want to forget her .   the plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated  ( one story arc is psychological realism ,  the other is supernatural horror )  outlandish climax which is so badly conceived ,  acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previously .   overall ,  the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of m .  knight shamalyan's first undergraduate film class .  the acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them - at least until the film derails utterly and completely .   my recommendation - send your doppelganger ,  but avoid a first-person encounter . 
 " nada "  was the most inadequate follow-up to  " les noces rouges "  which , with hindsight , appears now as the last good movie of chabrol's golden era  ( 1967-1973 )   " nada "  is chabrol's first real attempt at a wholly political movie ; its previous work  " les noces rouges "  had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in french provinces .  " nada "  includes terrorists , ambassador , hostage-taking , a lot of blood , not really chabrol's field . a heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grâce  : only duchaussoy , who had already played with the director  , and maurice garrel are up to scratch . viviane romance  , one of duvivier's actresses  (  " la belle equipe "   " panique "  )   , is wasted as a madam  ( gabrielle )  . italian actors  ( fabio testi , lou castel ) are awful .   with  " nada "  this a second period of barren inspiration for chabrol  . it would be  " violette nozières "  before he was again at the top of his game . 
give this movie a break !  its worth at least a  " 7 "  !  that little girl is a good actor and she's cute ,  too .  jim belushi is a comic genius .  you can't help but feel good at the end !  i wish there were more wholesome shows like this ,  that you can enjoy with your kids ! 
well ,  i can once and for all put an end to the question :  'what is the worst movie ever made .  .  . ever ? ' it is flight of fury ,  starring and co-written by steven seagal .  sure there are lots of famously bad movies ,  but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously .   it is a romanian-made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood .  it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become .  this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry ,  knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again .   it was released only on video  ( i can't imagine why )  and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling . 
an unusual take on time travel :  instead of traveling to earth's past ,  the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet .  they beam down to this planet ,  whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours  ( that's cutting it close !  )  .  in some kind of futuristic library ,  they meet mr .  atoz  ( a to z ,  get it ?  ha-ha )  and his duplicates .  it turns out ,  instead of escaping their planet's destruction via space travel ,  the usual way ,  the inhabitants have all escaped into their planet's various past time eras .  mr .  atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection  ( check out the discs we see here ,  another trek prognostication of cds and dvds !  )  .  when mr .  atoz prepares the machine  ( the atavachron-what-sis )  ,  gallant kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the planet's version of earth's 17th century ,  where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery .  there's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time ,  using phrasing of the time  (  "  .  .  . you're a bully fine coo .  .  witch !  witch !  they'll burn ye .  .  .  !  "  )  .  spock & mccoy follow kirk ,  but end up in an ice age ,  5000 years earlier .   kirk manages to get back to the library first .  the real story here is spock's reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors ,  the warlike vulcans of 5000 years ago .  this doesn't really make sense ,  except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change  ( even so ,  spock & mccoy weren't 'prepared' by atoz - oh ,  well ;  it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from 'millions of light years' away ,  instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical vulcan )  .  in any case ,  spock really shows his nasty side here - forget  " day of the dove "  and remember  " this side of paradise "  - mccoy quickly finds out that his vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged .  spock also gets it on with zarabeth ,  a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment  ( a couple of trek novels were written about spock's son ,  the result of this union )  .  all these scenes are eye-openers ,  a reminder of just how much spock conceals or holds in .  it's also ironic that ,  only a few episodes earlier  (  " requiem for methuselah "  )  ,  mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens .  kirk ,  meanwhile ,  tussles with the elderly atoz ,  who insists that kirk head back to some past era  (  " you are evidently a suicidal maniac "  - great stuff from actor wolfe ,  last seen in  " bread and circuses "  )  .  it all works out in the end ,  but ,  like i mentioned earlier ,  they cut it very close .  a neat little trek adventure ,  with a definite cosmic slant . 
i'm not a fan of the left behind book series - the books are written at a 6th-grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science ,  technology ,  and politics .  while the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture ,  their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous  ( an example is their explanation for the russian/arab invasion of israel )  .  also ,  the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel .  still ,  i found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of revelation .  for a similar reason ,  i watched this film adaptation .  i am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor .  the acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over-acting .  the script is rather bad ,  though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis .  the characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped .  events feel scattered and disconnected .  the dialogue sometimes sounds rushed .  at least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory .  here ,  the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book .  the pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed ,  and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded .  the music is schizophrenic .  at times ,  it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture .  at other moments ,  it reminds me of sitcom and mini-series music .  and still other bits remind me of a poppy mtv soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film .  i can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane ,  but that's it .  the other scenes involving the disasters after the rapture are far from compelling .  the film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face .  in all ,  i found the movie just as disappointing as the series .  this is not the film to rally christians around it .  i hope that this film does not get any attention at the theaters next year .  it would be more unnecessary bad publicity for christianity .  for an example of a compelling ,  intelligent ,  well-researched series based on revelation that presents a realistic and christian world view without offending the secular reader  ( who after all should be whom a christian is trying to reach )  read the christ clone trilogy by james beauseigneur .  it's a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality . 
i felt brain dead ,  i'll tell you .  this is the worst film i have ever bought .   ( in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name )  .  the performances are so terrible they are laughable .  the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire .  the script promotes that kind of tv movie ,  stare into the middle distance kind of acting .  the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani ,  they have one look each ,  and stick to it .  plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this .  the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes .  avoid like a plague . 
ok .  .  .  .  i just have 3 words - cheesy ,  cheesy and cheesy !  the only redeeming feature of this movie is dean cain .  other than that - it's cheeseball supreme !  !  !  !   the movie does have some promise in the concept - an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon - basically giving us more of  " jurassic park "  meets  " reign of fire "  .  .  .  .  .  there are some great possibilities ,  but they just don't follow through .  .  .  .  the special effects are decent - even though you know the dragon is cgi ,  it doesn't horribly look like cgi .  .  .  .    i wouldn't lay the blame on dean cain  ( although he is one of the producers )  ,  i'd lay more of the blame on phillip roth - the director and writer .  it's his job to make this film .  .  .  .  and ,  unfortunately ,  he failed . 
i've been a fan of all things bill maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting .  of course ,  i am catholic ,  come from a well-educated family and go to church of my own volition ,  which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of bill's opinions .   bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative .  he's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i . e .  one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion  ( or ,  more accurately ,  by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of god )  ,  but that said he never looks at its positive side .  quite frankly ,  i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of calcutta where mother theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor .  she's dead now of course ,  but he could easily visit the jesuit priest in east la who runs homeboy industries ,  which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills ,  get their tattoos removed ,  and to become responsible members of society ,  or he could visit usc's institute for advanced catholic studies ,  which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians ,  diplomats ,  and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day .  of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion ,  and it's so much easier to continue to make snide ,  superficial jokes .   that fits into the other large problem with bill's movie ,  which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is .  in this movie ,  you have maher the cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational christian truck stop service ,  in a night club with a dutch guy who smokes pot all the time ,  with the minister of a storefront church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ ,  and with an actor playing jesus at a  " holy land "  theme park .   what you won't see in bill's film ,  beyond some superficial speculation alongside a ph . d in grand central station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses ,  is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like notre dame ,  byu ,  or wheaton college ,  who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter .  you won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of c . s .  lewis ,  g . k .  chesterton ,  or any papal encyclicals ,  and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non-abrahamic  ( judaism ,  christianity ,  and islam )  faiths whatsoever .  all you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending ,  snobby elitist from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut-level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w .  bush  ( twice )  lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it .   i get a lot of what bill's saying ,  but for someone possessing his intellect and influence ,  this film was nothing less than pathetic .  anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the teletubbies . 
i never met a single person  ( out of hundreds )  who hated this movie .  bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur ,  or a victim of one .  this film has everything .  ask yourself ,   " are you a fan of .   .   .   ?  "  then go see  " laputa "  .   it's not my favorite movie ,  but my favorite is directed by the same person  ( hayao miyazaki )  .  in any case ,  this one ranks among my top five .  and i've seen a lot of movies . 
very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that i really didn't care who would fare the best  ( or was that the purpose of the film ,  to portray some smooth talking cold-hearted new york city folks ?  )  no romance here ,  no comedy either .  acting is very flat and a very predictable plot .  what annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies .  man ,  can't you see that the more you quote ,  the less significant your own movie becomes ?  try to be original yourself !  a small budget is no excuse at all ,  first-time director neither .  crappy ,  crappy ,  crappy .  no wonder it only cost me one buck .  .  . 
ok i caught this film halfway through ,  but . oh . dear . god . it . sounds . like . they're . all . reading . from . scripts .   especially that guy who is now in teachers and the book group ,  although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to !   ( the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting ,  scripting and general plausibility )  it quite clearly appears to be a cash-in on human traffic ,  but whilst that is not the best film ever ,  it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest-yet-hopeless gcse students trying to get a pass grade .  not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash ! 
a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only ,  the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids .  as a matter of fact ,  with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces ,  at least for continuity's sake .   speaking of ann sheridan ,  she is the one true shining light of this movie .  to paraphrase a cliché ,  ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd !   another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan .  unfortunately  ,  this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background .  for a better example of the sheridan-reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row . 
satan's little helper is one of the better b horror movies i have seen .  when i say better i mean the story .  the film hatches a new plot ,  something that's not so cliché in the horror genre - something fresh .  but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it .  questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie .   the film first caught my attention while i was cruising the horror section in hmv .  i was tired of all the so called  " terrifiying "  hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different .  the cover art for satan's little helper immediately caught my attention .  as you can see ,  the image draws you in - it's chilling !  i knew it was a straight to dvd release - but i took a chance .  i mean ,  i just seen  " boogey man "  the night before - so it couldn't get any worse !  after i watched the movie ,  i was semi-satisfied .  i loved the plot of the movie .  it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend ,  so he could kill .  in some sick deranged way ,  he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror .  it was a great idea to set the film on halloween night .  this way ,  no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid .  they would simply think he was his guardian .  but ,  this is also where the  " plot holes "  begin to surface .   if your son came home with a  " friend "  he met trick or treating - that's fine .  you wouldn't think anything of it - if he was 9 !  ,  or round about the same age as him .  if however ,  he appeared with a strange man in a mask ,  you would be startled and protective of your child .  you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself .  you would ask why he is with your son .  he doesn't know him .  you would tell him to please leave .  he isn't a family friend .  he's a stranger .  now ,  we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers .  in this case ,  the mum is completely fine with it .  huh ?  they never seem to think it's a tad odd that the  " man "  doesn't speak - at all .  gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend ,  but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word .   the film goes down hill from there .  the thing that got me the most was ,  all the mum said was  " do you want some cider ?  "  .  i can't count how many times she says this in the movie .  it's like ,  oh you're dying - we have cider though ,  it's all good !  !  the movie started promising ,  and failed to deliver .  it was more of a horror/comedy ,  and even as that it fails to deliver .  i guess you could call it a  " dud "  ,  " flop "  etc .  .   the best thing about the movie is the cover art .  though ,  something tells me that's not worth the 12 dollars ! 
when i was at the movie store the other day ,  i passed up blonde and blonder ,  but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie .  who knows ?  i mean ,  i'm sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it ,  blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up .  but when i started watching it :  executive producer pamela anderson ,  wow ,  i knew i was in for something scary .  not only that ,  but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness :  pam anderson and denise richards ,  not to offend them ,  but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20's ,  not their 40's .  the story was just plain bad and obnoxious .   dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's ,  they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world ,  it's just really sad .  but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins ,  the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their  " ignorance is bliss "  attitudes .  they are set up to make a  " hit "  on a guy ,  and they think they're just going to  " show him a good time "  ,  but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls .   denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before .  i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy ,  but it was more than stupid ,  it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary .  would i ever recommend this ?  not in a million years ,  the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as  " sex kittens "  ,  it's more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell .   1/10
even without speaking a word ,  billy connely is wonderful as a zombie .  .  .  carrie ann moss as  " mom "  ?  ,  even better .  zombie girlfriends ?     "  .  .  . my father thied to eat me .  .  .  i never tried to eat timmy .  "    and i thought dawn of the dead was good .  it's kinda like airplane meets  ( meats ?  )  night of the living dead ,  sponsored by zomcom .  .   and don't forget my head coffin  and fido in an aloha shirt is just way cool !   and yes ,  the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on .    sufice it to say ,  it all really works ! 
'p'  ( or club-p )  should really be called 'l' for lame .  every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much-hyped logline :   " thai lesbians fighting monsters .  "  rather ,  this is the tale of a khmer country girl who's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd  ( but specific )  rules :   " don't walk under a clothesline ,  "   " don't eat raw meat ,  "  and  " don't accept money for your powers .  "  well ,  guess what folks ,  the girl moves to bangkok to raise some money as a 'bar-girl' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the 'foreign johns' who pay for her services .   while this film can't even be released in thailand due to it's controversial subject matter most american audiences will find this ho-hum horror pic a cross between  " showgirls "  and  " interview with the vampire "  as directed by walt disney .   if not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the mpaa could probably rate this for pre-teens only .  there is literally broadcast tv adult fare ,  although you'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a thai porn star in real life .   as for the 'lesbian' angle ,  there's one brief smooch and a couple of  " i love you's "  to prove that the two main stars really are a couple  ( on brother )  .  and the p-bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts  ( there's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth  .  .  .  ooh ,  phallic imagery )  .   no nudity ,  no real monster  ( unless you count a five foot high thai spirit with yellow eyes )  ,  and no way any adult should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on dvd .  you've been warned ! 
canadian filmmaker mary harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the sixties and the hollow avaricious eighties .  with  " the notorious bettie page "  she points her unswerving eye at fifties america ,  an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of joe mccarthy ,  while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade .  harron and her co-writer guinevere turner ,  are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol .  this is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body .  if the details of bettie's life were all the film was concerned about ,  then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin .  clearly ,  harron is more interested in america's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now .  together with a fearless lead performance by gretchen mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of w . mott hupfel iii ,  she accomplishes this goal admirably ,  holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own  " enlightened "  21st century attitudes towards so-called pornography .  as america suffocates under a new conservatism ,  this is a film needed more than ever . 
a tour deforce !  ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit toooooo sweet !  starting with the great cinematography ,  color ,  costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie .  i have seen several adaptations of this great novel ,  but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot !  it is a masterful fagan ,  never leaving his character to do a song .  you never really know if you like him or not ,  the same feeling i got in the book .  in other versions you hate him from start to finish .  bill sykes .  .  .  .  when you read the book hes a mean one ,  and so he is in this movie .  oliver reed was masterful .  his wife directed this masterpiece .  i went and saw his last movie ,  gladiator based on his many fine performances ,  not to see the headliners .  the music fits the times and the mood .  who will buy this beautiful movie ?  you should ! 
at the beginning of the film ,  you might double-check the dvd cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times ,  but no worries .  it's not  " memoirs of a geisha "  that you purchased ;  just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be .  still ,  the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie ,  as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery .  he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri  ( ritual suicide through disembowelment )  .  cut to present day ,  when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago .  from then onwards ,  this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional .  let's start with the good aspects ,  namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all-time favorite british horror wench  ( well ,  together with britt eckland ,  linda hayden and ingrid pitt )  .  the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent ,  imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter .  the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff .  the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress !  in this  " possessed "  state ,  she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests .  so ,  strictly spoken ,  it's not really  " evil "  that dwells in the house ;  just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands !  obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening ,  especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in  " ghostbusters "  .   " the house where evil dwells "  is probably the least scary ghost movie ever .  throughout most of the running time ,  you'll be wondering whether director kevin connor  ( who nevertheless made the excellent horror films  " motel hell "  and  " from beyond the grave "  )  intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top ,  like  " motel hell "  maybe .  but then again ,  everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her lines with a straight and sincere face ,  so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed .   " the house where evil dwells "  is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning .  i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds ,  but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights .  well ,  those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders  ( or are they crabs ?  )  in the daughter's bedroom .  how totally random and irrelevant was that ?  if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation ,  make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep .   trivia note for horror buffs :  keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba . 
another aussie masterpiece ,  this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural ,  and it does very well .  it doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks ,  it focuses more on emotional impact .  a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney & co .  bring to life .  it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside ,  and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago .  strange things begin to happen in the house ,  and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared ,  who was actually a mass murderer .  highly recommended .  8/10
i imagine that the young people involved in the making of  " necromancy "   ( aka  " the witching "  plus a bunch of other titles )  must have felt a little weird being on the set of a horror movie with the man who :  participated with john houseman in the production of a proletarian play  (  " the cradle will rock "  )  ;  scared people into thinking that aliens were invading  (  " the war of the worlds "  )  ;  and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time  (  " citizen kane "  )  .  and now orson welles was starring in a third-rate flick about a satanic cult .   there's basically nothing creative about this movie .  lots of nudity ,  but the background music always proves really distracting .  even if the movie wasn't particularly predictable ,  it still wasn't worth seeing .  how low welles had sunk .  fortunately ,  over the final thirteen years of his life ,  he narrated the documentary  " bugs bunny superstar "   ( about the warner bros .  cartoons of the 1940s )  and hosted the documentary  " the man who saw tomorrow "   ( about nostradamus )  .  i recommend those two ,  but not this one .  just avoid it .   also starring pamela franklin and michael ontkean . 
ah ,  clichés ,  clichés ,  clichés ;  they're a main part of a wide variety of horror films . this one ,  has a lot of them . still ,  it's stephen king ,  one of the best masters of horror .  this movie was really good ,  just too predictable .  and what horror movie doesn't have stupid people ?  this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken .  pet semetary i found to be creepy a little .  the way everything is set up was really spooky ,  but not terrifying .  for the most part ,  the acting was somewhat believable ,  the suspense wasn't that suspenseful ,  but the entertainment level is set at a major rank ;  my eyes were practically glued to the screen . all stephen king fans must see this movie ,  but as for anyone else ,  expect an okay thriller . 
literally every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors ,  contemporaries ,  and those to follow .  bad special effects ,  a weak storyline ,  ridiculous amounts of blood and gore ,  annoying and pointless characters ,  all that you can expect .   " attack of the sabretooth "  is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering smilodon cats for an attraction .  the cats escape and begin to kill people ,  the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them ,  and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats .   special effects-wise ,  the film is about an average achievement given its budget .  the sabretooths are portrayed through poor cgi .  amazingly ,  though ,  the cats look more realistic in an up-close ,  detailed shot rather than the longer ,  more distant shots where the cgi is better concealed .  their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful .  just as you'd expect ,  they attack ,  rip off some arms and legs ,  and leave very little behind .  this is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock .   the plot and characters are just as horrendous .  we have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt .  and take it very ,  very seriously .  even so much as to trespass on private property ,  tamper with security systems ,  and steal .  why are they taking a simple game so seriously ?  did i miss something ?  was there money involved ?  or were they sent to do it ?  i don't know ,  i could barely follow the film .  but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it .  even so ,  they went too far for normal .    " attack of the sabretooth "  is a very poor film .  even for a low-budget sci-fi flick ,  it is a very poor and cheap example .  it will bore most viewers to tears ,  might be attractive for some ,  and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through .  and keep in mind ,  this is not a comedy ,  this is a cheap horror flick ,  so it's not suppose to be comical . 
a very good movie .  a classic sci-fi film with humor ,  action and everything .  this movie offers a greater number of aliens .  we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces .  the emperor is somewhat an original character .  i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese .   ( excellent references )  i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga .  in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls .  i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi-wan .  it gives a sadness and a tear .  the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie :  when vader turns on the emperor .  luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi-wan ,  yoda and .  .  . his father  ( 1997 version not hayden christenssen )  .  the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia .  there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending .  i felt there was much more than meets the eye .  and as always the john william's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe . 
there aren't too many times when i see a film and go ,   " huh ,  what ?  "  ,  but this was one of them .  maybe after seeing zabriskie point i felt much the same way woody allen felt after seeing 2001- he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period ,  realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on .  michelangelo antonioni ,  in one of his few tries at making films inside of the us  ( after red desert ,  he did blow-up ,  this film ,  china ,  and the passenger ,  all filmed outside his native italy )  ,  i could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium .  the results show that he doesn't lack the means to present images ,  feelings ,  tones ,  colors ,  sounds ,  and a visual representation of this era .   " a director's job is to see "  ,  antonioni once stated .  whatever that means ,  he doesn't disappoint for the admirer of his post-fifties work  ( i say post-fifties since i've yet to see any of his films from before l'avventura )  .   what he does lack is a point ,  at least the kind of point that he could bring in blow-up and the eclipse .  you get the feeling of what is around these characters ,  what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness ,  however in this case the characters and the actors don't bring much conviction or purpose .  antonioni ,  coming from the school of hard-knocks ,  neo-realistic film-making ,  does do what he can with his mostly non-professional cast  ( those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters )  ,  but the two stars mark frechette and daria halprin seem as if antonioni's under-directing them .  perhaps that was the point .  the story's split into three acts ,  thankfully not too confusing ,  as mark escapes his existence around the boiling ,  dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60's la area ,  and daria is sent out from la to drive to phoenix for some business meeting .  they meet by chance as mark's plane  ( how does he know how to drive ,  maybe a little background info there ?  )  and daria's car meet up ,  and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert .  aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene ,  much of this act isn't terribly interesting .    the two leads are fair enough to look at ,  but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity ?  the ideas that come forth  ( in part from a screenplay co-written by sam shepard )  aren't too revealing ,  except for one brief instant where drugs vs .  reality is brought up .  then the film heads towards the third act ,  as mark decides to do the right thing ,  under disastrous circumstances ,  and daria arrives at her boss' place ,  only to be in full disillusionment  ( not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film )  .  although the film took its time telling its story ,  i didn't have as much of a problem with that as i did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer .  i understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the self-confidence of the  " anti-establishment "  ,  but maybe antonioni isn't entirely fully aware of it himself .  in some scenes he as director and editor  ( and the often astounding cinematography by alfio contini )  find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground .  not to say the technical side of zabriskie point isn't involving to a degree  ( this may make some feel drowsy ,  as antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say francis ford coppola is )  .    the deserts ,  skies ,  city ,  and even the faces in close-ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame ,  bringing us in .  the soundtrack is equally compelling ,  with a master stroke including a sweet rolling stones song at one point ,  and then a crushing ,  surreal pink floyd song  ( re-titled from 'careful with that axe eugene ,  one of their best pre-dark side )  in the explosion sequence .  if only the performances weren't so one-sided i might find this to be on par with blow-up or the eclipse .  it's an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand ,  and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie/radical movement of the late 60's .  but hey ,  what may be boring for an american such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the us ,  such as say ,  italy .  and it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing . 
in france ,  it's considered polite from french critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films brian de palma left behind him .  however ,  a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects  " carrie "   ( 1976 )  ,   " the fury "   ( 1978 )   " scarface "   ( 1983 )  without mentioning his borrowings from hitchcock .  here ,  in  " dressed to kill "  ,  it's impossible not to think of  " vertigo "   ( 1958 )  for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in  " psycho "   ( 1960 )  .  about our involved film ,  i don't want to revive the old debate :  does de palma rip off hitchcock ?  instead ,  i would tend to be generous and to classify  " dressed to kill "  in the category of de palma's winners alongside  " sisters "   ( 1973 )  and  " obssession "   ( 1976 )  .  with however some reservations and they're the ones i previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between de palma's rabid fans and his detractors .   if there's one sure thing in  " dressed to kill "  which can generate general agreement among film-lovers ,  it's de palma's virtuosity in directing .  he wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do .  his sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura .  the audience is easily glued in front of the screen .  this is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures .  by the way ,  in  " psycho "  ,  there were also long silent ,  suspenseful parts .  .  .   but the main drawback in de palma's 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot can't be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic ,  corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories .  the prostitute is the sole witness of the crime .  then ,  she's suspected by the police and has to act on her own  ( with a little help from the victim's son from the scene in the subway onwards )  )  to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence .  apart from the fact that de palma uses a type of character who for once isn't demeaned at all ,  it's a menu which smells the reheated .  and the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one .  yes ,  it's superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function ,  one figures :   " it's almost gratuitous filler "  .  perhaps de palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows  ( and even before )  who the killer is .   the two central mainsprings in de palma's set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism .  the latter theme is well present in  " dressed to kill "  from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie .  and the filmmaker isn't afraid to film his main actress and wife nancy allen in her underwear .  i find his approach about this theme rather doubtful .  but maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and de palma wanted to stir his peeping tom side .   i don't want to demean at all de palma's work .  his prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects .  twenty six years after ,  the controversy he aroused amid movie-goers isn't ready to subside . 
i blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that i paid as much as i did but i would say that it's at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting .  it is not a good movie in any way but i must say that i was pretty darn entertained .  i guess it could be called so-bad-it's-good .   as i said ,  the acting is awful ,  i feel like i could have done a better job showing ,  at least ,  any emotion .  the story is nothing new and has been done better .  i guess i just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type film .  i would say rent this or download it but definitely don't buy it .  it is not worth more than one watch . 
this is the best of the 43 films that rainer werner fassbinder made ;  his most successful at least .  he was one of the leading directors in the new germany after wwii .   hanna schygulla was magnificent as the cold ,  calculating maria bruan ,  who lost her husband to the war ,  found him after she took an american soldier as a lover ,  lost him again after he went to jail for her ,  and found him agin at the end .  her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end .   such is life .  things come and go ,  and you do the best you can .  you can give up or adjust you way of thinking to survive .  even though maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do ,  she never stopped loving hermann ,  which makes the end such a tragedy .   excellent drama . 
laid up and drugged out ,  as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract ,  with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi-oblivion ,  i happened to catch this movie on cable .  i wouldn't want anyone to think that i paid to view it in a cinema ,  or rented it ,  or  heaven forfend !   that i watched it straight .   having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of the house ,  battling chariot  ( type 27 )  ,  the hanged man  ( type 041 )  ,  and other impossible sentinels ,  my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen .   it doesn't .   the banal plot revolves around a group of  " crazy kids "   a la scooby doo  attending a remote island for a world-shaking  " rave "   whatever that is .   ( you kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your pat boone )  after bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there  ( a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric )  ,  they find the  " rave "  deserted .   passing mention is made of a  " house "   presumably the titular house of the dead  but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence .   a fallen video camera acts as flashback filler ,  showing the island in the throes of a  party ?  !  is that it ?  oh ,  so this  " rave "  thingy is just a  " party "  ?  in the grand tradition of re-euphemizing  " used cars "  as  " pre-owned "  ,  or  " shell shock "  as  " post-traumatic stress disorder "  ,  the word  " party "  is now too square for you drug-addled ,  silicone-implanted ,  metrosexual jagoffs ?    it is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies .  intelligent thought stops here  i don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation .  zombies can't die  they're already un-dead .  they do not bleed ,  they know no pain .  unless their bodies are completely annihilated ,  they will continue being animated .  at least ,  that's what my jamaican witch priestess tells me .   which means that a  . 45 shot into their  " hearts "  is not going to stop them ,  nor will a machete to the torso .  and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not bring forth gouts of blood .  at least in the video game's logic ,  the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated ,  leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itself .   yet each actor-slash-model gets their matrix-circular-camera moment ,  slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum .  seriously ,  these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers from  " return of the jedi "  ,  who get knocked out when ewoks trip them .   i suppose the film's writer ,  mark altman ,  having penned the not-too-shabby  " free enterprise "  ,  felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference ,  in the character of jurgen prochnow ,  who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill .  there is also a reference to prochnow's primo role in the magnificent  " das boot "  ,  when one of the untrained b-actors mentions that he  " looks like a u-boat captain "  .   "  .  i wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on any of the snide references to other films ,  as when prochnow declares ,   " say hello to my little friend "  ,  presaging his machine gun moment .    aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the sisyphean futility of the video-game concept  ( i . e .  the game ends when you die  you cannot win )  ,  this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart .  accordingly ,  everyone dies in due course ,  except for a heterosexual pair of attractive white people .   a better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through acting school ,  although ona grauer's left breast did a good job ,  as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes :  priceless !  i especially liked the final scene with ona trying to act like she's been stabbed ,  but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast .   attempting to do something more constructive with my time ,  i pulled out my digitally-restored ,  35th anniversary ,  special edition ,  widescreen anamorphic dvd of  " manos :  the hands of fate .  "  ah ,  yes !   the drugs were suitably brain-numbing - now here was some quality film-making   ( movie maniacs ,  visit :  www . poffysmoviemania . com ) 
good story .  good script .  good casting .  good acting .  good directing .  good art direction .  good photography .  good sound .  good editing .  good everything .  put it all together and you end up with good entertainment .   the shame of it is that there aren't nearly enough films of this caliber being made these days .  we may count ourselves lucky that writers/directors like john hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices heard .   whenever i notice that i'm watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfying i have to conclude that something about that film is right . 
this is my all-time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film .  the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever .  not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two ;  like i'm putting all my eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance .  if i remember correctly ,  this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart  ( sorry for the sentimental cr*p but i'm woman so get over it ) all in all this film gets an 8/10 from me .  the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome . 
don't waste your time on this dreck .  as portrayed ,  the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture .   " gothic "  was entertainment at least ,  this is crap .  if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other ,  this may be right up your alley .  lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk ,  and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering .  mary shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever ,  but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect .  what a waste of time .  see gothic instead .  i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter ,  but didn't catch the title .  i was hoping this was it ,  but no such luck .  not recommended . 
wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a 'king of masks' for his mastery of sichuan change art .  liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person .  liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wang's mind .  the film is about prejudices ,  male domination ,  state of art ,  values and most importantly warmth .   i can't recommend this film enough .  the whole film is in loops .  everything has a significance .  its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes .  a total satisfaction .  for five minutes it is an artistic film ,  next five minutes its a sad film ,  next five minutes its a thriller .  it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face .  last scene on the rope is phenomenal .  story and script is flawless .  actors are brilliant .  both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed .  very impressive .  it was not even nominated for oscars .  that year 'english patient' got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category 'kolya' won .  'kolya' was just ok and about 'english patient' the lesser said the better .  watch it 9/10 . 
anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies .  this film is riveting and doesn't have a boring moment .  why ?  because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis .  i repeat--intelligent dialogue !  that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer's films ,  and that is why a lot of people don't like them .  they prefer action .  fine ,  let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films ,  while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this .   rohmer has always been accused of being  " talky .  "  well ,  he is ,  but to me that's a compliment ,  not a criticism .  shakespeare was talky ,  too .  is there a talkier play than  " hamlet ?  "  whenever the subject ,  or theme ,  of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values ,  there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values ,  an that is largely what this film is all about .  aristocracy and noble birth vs .  egalitarianism ;  loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path ;  the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life ,  even if the person possessing that life is not so nice ,  or even despicable .   ( anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky ,  or  " crime and punishment ?  "  )  these are what this film is all about .   the two leads in this film are impeccable ,  as if they were born to play these roles .  lucy russell ,  who is english and speaks french as her second language ,  is especially brilliant .  do yourself a favor and see this riveting film .  it may be the last film by this screen master . 
it pains me to write such a scathing review but by not doing so i'm simply encouraging these people .  first off ,  just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing .  in fact in this case ,  the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being squandered on a one legged race horse with the shits .  have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre ?  ever heard people laugh and thought  " what the dickens are you on "  ?  well even these twats weren't laughing .  things got so bad by mid way my cat took his first ever bath .  this is not film ,  this is children .  .  .  . no monkeys making images that leave you feeling like moving to france .  got to go ,  there's a clown at my door .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
and gi joe go stuck in the water ,  i die of laufther every time i see this movie ,  and then a big brown shark came ,  this is comedy at it's best ,  this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else ,  andrew dice clay ,  jerry ,  tucker ,  rock ,  they can't thouch the man the myth the legend eddie murphy ,   yo eddie we want more  more more more more more more  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video ,  not film .  the story is convoluted ,  and the production is amazingly sloppy .  note ,  for example ,  that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in vermont ,  where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony ,  the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees .  their ceremony - in vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants ,  including palms ,  which wouldn't last five minutes in the new england climate .  on yet another airplane trip ,  the establishing shot depicts a fedex cargo plane taking off .  presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage .  as for the plot ,  this movie expects you to believe that victor ,  the devoutly christian brother of arthur ,  is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his brother is gay .  not only that ,  but the pastor eventually sets victor up with a hit man to have ben and arthur killed  " to purge their souls of sin .  "  apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the ten commandments .  were it not for jamie brett gabel ,  who is surprisingly effective as arthur ,  this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all . 
i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of 2007 .  i am absolutely crazy about the show .  i think the entire cast is excellent .  it's one of my favorite show ever .  i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule .  that is really sad .  i hope they will bring it back  .  .  .  maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby ?  or is it only my wishful thinking ?    i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks ,  similar to mine .  i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up . 
okay .  .  .  it seems like so far ,  only the barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint .  beware ,  this writeup is *long* .   for those not in the knowing  ( mostly the non-belgians )   :  tom barman ,  director of this film ,  is the frontman of deus ,  one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in belgium .  basically ,  they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale .  then ,  egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart ,  with barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the deus-monicker .  the way it always happens in such cases ,  the post-breakdown deus was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original .  they tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album  " the ideal crash "  in 1999 ,  presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting .  they didn't quite make it .  however ,  egos were still pretty big it seems  :  big enough for barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies .   more often than not this sort of thing is a very big mistake ,  and this film does not make the exception .  and barman clearly went for *art* on this one ,  another very big mistake .  for one thing ,  he's a musician ,  not a movie director .  for another ,  deus at it's best made fun and provoking music ,  but never anything close to what i would consider *art* .  it shows .   so ,  what's this movie about ?  basically ,  it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people ,  doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in antwerp ,  as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting .  the characters are shallow ,  the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings .  humor ?  the whole film made me smile  ( slightly )  about 3 times ,  and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh  ( not quite loud )  .  mood ?  the film just doesn't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all .  mystery ?  well ,   ( *minor spoiler* ) the idea of the  " wind-man "  ,  inspiring the name of the film ,  is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very ,  and has been done a thousand times before  ( anyone remember johny destiny - one of tarantino's worst appearances on film to date )  ( *end minor spoiler* )  .  and well ,  its *artistic* ,  so don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous .  in other words ,  except for the few smiles ,  it bored me out of my shorts .   so what remains ?  well ,  the soundtrack is pretty good ,  though it suffers from some of the same problems that other ost's have shown lately  :  first ,  it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the cd .  second ,  it gives the impression that barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs ,  which simply doesn't work .  in the end ,  it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs .  and sadly ,  it's barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention ,  though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as i'm concerned .  all in all ,  it just stands to show that barman knows more about music than movies .  camera work is okay as well ,  though not anything that would make you scream out with joy .   the only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor .  since i originate from antwerp ,  it was fun to play a kind of  " guess-the-location "  game .  i would hardly consider this as a quality though .   all in all ,  another chance lost for flemmish film .  i keep on noticing that lately ,  the best belgian movies have been coming from the french part of the country .  this is mostly because at least ,  they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional  ( the brothers daerden come to mind )  .  maybe the flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too . 
`castle of blood'  ( aka `castle of terror' )  is a well-crafted ,  surprisingly spooky entry from italian director anthony dawson .  exquisite black and white cinematography ,  flawless dubbing ,  superb casting ,  fairly logical scripting ,  deliberate pacing and a surprise  ( though totally appropriate )  ending set this one apart .  only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between elizabeth  ( barbara steele )  and alan  ( georges rivière )  mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie .   while visiting england ,  edgar allan poe sits in a pub ,  telling one of his ghostly stories to count blackwood .  recognizing the great writer ,  alan ,  a young news reporter ,  requests an interview with poe .  during the course of the conversation ,  poe reveals that all of his stories are true .  incredulous ,  alan expresses his skepticism about life after death .  count blackwood offers to bet alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in blackwood's castle ,  a night following halloween when the dead walk .  alan cannot afford the bet ,  so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager .   unlike mario bava's overpraised `black sunday , '  ( aka `the mask of satan' )  ,  `castle of blood' is fairly restrained ,  making the few moments of violence even more dreadful ,  especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible italian space movies from the 60s .   it's a pity the only version of this film i've found is badly deteriorated  ( and recorded )  pan and scan version .  even so ,  it is well worth seeing ,  and cries out for a modern remake ,  perhaps with christina ricci or jennifer love hewitt in the role of elizabeth .  watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with robert wise's `the haunting' . 
 " land of plenty "  is not a film .  it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wenders .   many felt it in  " the million dollar hotel "  and now  " land of plenty "  makes it perfectly clear ;  not only has wenders lost it ,  he's actually turned into a bad director ,  creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes .   one might argue that the  " time you lose it "  comes for every director ,  but wenders' case is extreme .  it's as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - only to get sloppish results .   in a few words ,  this film does not deserve your time . 
an unusual film from ringo lam and one that's strangely under-appreciated .  the mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes .  a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse .  several horses get chopped up .  it's very unexpected .   the story is very simple ,  fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple .  the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood .    the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak .  blood is everywhere .  the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time .  sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it's never bad enough to ruin the film .    find this one ,  it's one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties .  just remember it's not child friendly . 
we have a lake .  we have an animated meteor crashing .  we have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers .  okay ,  so let's call this movie the crater lake monster .  what else can we add ?  hmm ,  two idiots called arnie & mitch to define the ultimate definition of  " comic relief "  .  we also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to .  aw crap ,  we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy !  no worries ,  let's introduce some guy with a moustache ,  have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy ,  then have him pop up somewhere near the lake ,  have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food .  that should work .   a complete ,  clumsy mess ,  this film .  its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you .  the first film to feature dave allen as a  " stop motion supervisor "  .  after this one ,  he joined forces with charles band for several years until the the mid-nineties ,  when band ran out of money to pay him ,  i guess .  the dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny .  unfortunately ,  that's about the only good thing that can be said for it .   good badness ?  yes .  the mind-bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list .  if not ,  arnie & mitch will do the trick .  3/10 and 8/10
i came at this film with high expectations .  i was aware of greenaway's work and 'the tempest' and was interested in an adaptation .  i first wanted to switch off after ten minutes ,  but felt that it would be unfair .  there was a representation of a storm ,  but where in your mind do you conceive a small boy peeing over a toy boat ?  it is symbolic of what ?  i continued another ten minutes my finger twitching over the 'off' button ,  somewhere something would capture my interest .  this is not shakespeare ,  it is not cinema .  there is a time and place for it ,  but i will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of shakespeare .  after twenty five minutes i gave up and that was the end .  i then read all the comments on this website and the pretentiousness of the film is only matched by its defendants .  'its a painting .  .  .  .  . then put it in a gallery' ,  'it's a ballet .  .  .  .  . keep it on the stage then' .  shakespeare can be done intelligently ,  and the plays were performed to mass audiences ,  they were accessible ,  and this version helps put a wedge between shakespeare and the general population at large - and i do not think that the bard would be happy with that . 
the sentinel represents everything about the soul-lessness of hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days .  i cannot possibly think of one good thing about it ,  it's all so generic ,  so factory-made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting ,  undeserving public .   a plot about a secret service agent planning to assassinate the prez could well be entertaining .  if handled by a good director or caring cast that is .  douglas is the one who is framed .  basinger is the first lady ,  with whom he is having an affair  ( an undeveloped ,  unresolved plot contrivance )  .  sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't .  and longoria is nothing .  a woman with a fortune of maybelline and .  .  . that's it .  i guess there are less requirements for women when entering the secret service .  as usual in a film like this the role of the prez himself is nothing more than a tool ,  a token and is very badly written .   clark johnson's ,  he who gave us the equally as pathetic swat back in 2003 ,  mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap tv-movie .  douglas ,  basinger and sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-in their performances from afar .  eva longoria ,  the most over-exposed woman of the 21st century ,  is basically only in this to attract to the desperate housewives audience .  her role is 100% pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development .  she barely has 2 lines to rub together .  a truly shameless marketing ploy .   if you're a glutton for punishment then don't let me stop you .  but it is time and money you won't be getting back . 
when i learned of sir alec guinness' death ,  this was the first of his many films i thought of re-seeing .  what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years .  and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame .  his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears .  both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites . 
daphne zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher ,  and the light fades quickly .  if not her ,  than what other reason to watch this .  five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition .  problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting ,  and the group are short a few people .  then ,  a killer is on the loose .  i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one .  it had a fair set up ,  or maybe that was just daphne zuniga in it .  the film is too slow ,  and almost as silent as a library .  most of the acting is below average ,  and the  " point-of-view "  moments are so old news .  acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as  " hellraiser "  and  " entrapment "  scored this ,  in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie .  still ,  it seems higher than the movie deserves .  so ,  other than young and zuniga ,  this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel . 
this movie has a great message , a impressive cast ,  ellen burstyn ,  samantha mathis ,  jodelle ferland (  was 4 years old when she made this movie )  ellen burstyn and jodelle ferland have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up-coming emmy awards in new york ,  peter masterson-director- has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also .  april 1 ,  2001 ,  jodelle ferland 'won' ,  best actress in a tv drama ,  at the young artist awards ,  in studio city ,  ca .  i can see why they have 3 nominations .  mermaid is a true story ,  during the cridits they have the real family on the set ,  something you don't see often .  you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores .  do watch it , you'll be glad you did . 
it takes patience to get through david lynch's eccentric ,  but-- for a change-- life-affirming chronicle of alvin straight's journey ,  but stick with it .  though it moves as slow as straight's john deere ,  when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging ,  the painful regrets and secrets ,  and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation .  richard farnsworth caps his career with the year's most genuine performance ,  sad and poetic ,  flinty and caring .  and sissy spacek matches him as his  " slow "  daughter rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad .  rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family . 
you might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made-for from the beginning ,  since the credits list susan dey as  " special guest star .  "  um ,  why would a one-off mow like this have a guest star ?  well ,  if you stick with it ,  you'll find yourself paying attention to little else but ms .  dey's butt ,  wiggling in a flowered bikini as the  " partridge family "  house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes .  susan's derrière is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo-disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene .  sadly ,  susie and her tush fight a losing battle :  the jiggle-tv craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off ,  so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role .  in 1976 fat freddy silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as susan's audition tape for  " charlie's angels .  "  as is ,  our susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber ,  neurotic women .   the view beyond susan's heinie ,  it must be said ,  is not very compelling .  the scenery is nice ,  and photographed in a bizarre ,  hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera .  nope .  it's just a typically suspense-challenged 70's made-for-tv thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash ( and collect some cable residuals ,  though they obviously didn't know that at the time )  and show off their  " range .  "  here we're treated to a tv-scale nuclear family ,  squaring off against tv-scale thugs who can't decide whether they're a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult  ( thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in dune buggies )  and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television :  don't mess with dennis weaver  ( see  " mccloud "  and  " duel "  )  .  the only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage-son character of steve ,  played by the long-forgotten  ( if ever-remembered )  kristoffer tabori ,  who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is  ( supposedly )  menacing his family .  but steve ,  as played by tabori  ( gosh ,  why didn't we see more from this wunderkind ?  )  ,  is actually just grumpy and moody and isn't one bit conflicted when big d gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial  ( and literal )  sand .  for the sleep-deprived and susan deyniacs  ( there must be some of you out there )  only . 
one star .  that's all this documentary deserves .  i haven't felt this disappointed in watching a movie ,  let alone a documentary ,  in quite some time .   i'm a big fan of the  " walking with .  .  .  "  series ,  including it's nigel marvin spin-offs ,  for all their gleeful fun yet informative information .  and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures ,  the subject is still interesting and unique to explore .  having seen all the other docs from the series ,  i figured i need to see this one as well ,  especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places .   well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc .  .  .  what were you thinking ?  !  lol .   though the information that they were able to get through was interesting ,  the presentation failed in every other way possible .  it had a terrible flow ,  was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say  ( with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place )  ,  horrible effects  ( that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects )  ,  and overused mtv-style camera effects .   speaking of the makeup effects ,  one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man-in-suit horror movie .  well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous .  none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions .   the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way ,  or looks remotely real .  it doesn't even look like it was taken seriously .  it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had .  remember the episode in  " walking with dinosaurs "  of the fate of the ornithochirus  ( sp ?  )  ?  that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it .  it's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all .  when you are more engaged in the subject and it's own personal story ,  even one that is just speculation ,  you care more about the facts surrounding it .   the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration  ( at least in the bbc version i saw )  and the music .  otherwise ,  do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh  ( which i did frequently ,  but usually followed by rolling eyes )  .  this does not belong on the shelf with the other  " walking with .  .  .  "  docs .   and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series ?  hmmm .  .  . 
no ,  i've never seen any of the  " santa slasher "  series ,  i . e .  'silent night ,  deadly night , ' the original 'black christmas' or this one ,  'christmas evil . ' i've heard all about their reputation ,  or ,  mads  ( mothers against deranged santas .  )  i thought i would rent this one as i've heard it pop up as a reference on a 'fat guys at the movies' segment .   mothers should be against this ,  but not for the ooooohhhh  " killer "  santa ,  but for the fact this movie was just plain crap .  boring ,  long  even at only 92 minutes ,  crap .   little boy sees santa arrive down a chimney in 1947 ,  deliver presents ,  eat some goodies and miraculously ,  float up the chimney .  boy goes to bed ,  but returns to living room to witness mommy and santa  ( sort of )  getting it on .  apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life ,  though the scene was about as steamy as when ralphie's dad got the  " leg lamp "  in 'a christmas story . ' he was sooo disturbed ,  he went to the attic and ,  well cut his own hand .   fast forward to the future !  now ,  it's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory .  we get a whiff of him being a little off-kilter ,  and he stalks both kids and parents alike .  who's naughty ,  who's nice ,  blah blah .  it takes a good two-thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that's not foreshadowed from frame one .  no movie should take that long .   i will admit ,  this movie had its tension building ,  but only because i kept expecting him to do something ,  anything to anyone .  when he finally does ,  well ,  punish  " who's naughty ,  "  it's as graphic as a  " garbage pail kid "  card .  and i haven't mentioned the wtf ending .  i'm thinking it was a metaphor ,  but in reality ,  it's just as weird as the rest of the movie .   ( take the brother who's upset his sibling is killing ,  and his solution isuh ,  killing .  )  don't open this mess ,  even on christmas eve ,  or evil .  again ,  i didn't watch the other  " santa-slashers "  but this one sucked bad .  it built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present . 
there are numerous films relating to ww2 ,  but mother night is quite distinctive among them :  in this film ,  we are introduced to howard campbell  ( nolte )  ,  an american living in berlin and married to a german ,  helga noth  ( lee )  ,  who decides to accept the role of a spy :  more specifically ,  a cia agent major wirtanen  ( goodman )  recruits campbell who becomes a nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the hitler regime .  however ,  the deal is that the us government will never acknowledge campbell's role in the war for national security reasons ,  and so campbell becomes a hated figure across the us .  after the war ,  he tries to conceal his identity ,  but the past comes back and haunts him .  his only  " friend "  is wirtanen ,  but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor campbell .  .  .   the story is deeply touching ,  as we watch the tragedy of campbell who although a great patriot ,  is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him .  not only that ,  but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him ,  have many secrets of their own .  vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere ,  with campbell's despair building up and almost choking the viewer .   nolte plays the role of his life ,  in my opinion ;  he is even better than in  " affliction "  ,  although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self-destruction .  sheryl lee is also excellent ,  and the same can be said for the whole cast in general .   i haven't read the book ,  so i cannot appraise how the film compares to it .  in any case ,  this is something of no importance here :  my critique is upon the film per se ,  and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 9/10 . 
good movie ,  very 70s ,  you can not expect much from a film like this ,  ,  sirpa lane is an actress of erotic films ,  a nice body but nothing exceptional savant to a pornographic actress from the body disappears ,  but the '70s were characterized a small breasts and a simple eroticism .  not demand a lot from these films are light years away from the movies today ,  the world has changed incredibly .  the plot is simple and the actors not extraordinary .  and the brunette actress has a single body ,  has one breast slightly bigger .  be satisfied .  papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm  .  .  .  download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them . 
i saw this film in its premier week in 1975 .  i was 13 years old and at that time i found it adequate and somewhat fun .  i then came to discover the world of doc savage through the bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories .  i had no idea before any of this of the realm of doc ,  but i fast became one of the most avid doc savage fans you could ever meet .  i read  ( and still own )  all of the bantam books ,  i started going to comic book cons  ( along with star trek and doctor who and all manner of geeky fat kid events )  and had a wonderful time with each adventure i took with doc and the original fab 5 .  philip jose farmer's book - the apocalyptic life of doc savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day i have very fond feelings regarding my doc phase .  in so saying i have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat .  it is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up .  the screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story .  these stories from the 30's were short and if one looked at lester dent's  ( aka kenneth robeson )  outline for writing them ,  they broke down into perfect 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment .  one would have thought that with george pal and michael anderson at the helm ,  it would have turned out better .  the spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there ,  but then fall short .  it is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character actors  ( guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film )  who all acquit themselves very well .  paul gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and bill lucking is a television perennial .  all the rest have fallen off the map sadly .  i do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero ,  but i fear i will not watch it much as it is too painful .  i would say 0 but i give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction  ( doc's answering machine at the end was a nice touch )  and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun . 
this is the least scary film i have ever seen .  how the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film .  the blob moves so slowly that an o . a . p in a zimmerframe could escape it .  the blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten .  if you havent seen this film i recommend you do ,  its far too funny to be taken seriously . 
* !  ! - spoilers -  !  ! *  before i begin this ,  let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the  " authorized version "  of this movie ,  remade by stephen king ,  himself ,  in 1997 .   both advantages made me appreciate this version of  " the shining ,  "  all the more .   also ,  let me say that i've read mr .  king's book ,   " the shining "  on many occasions over the years ,  and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work ,  stanley kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling  .  .  .  and scary .   kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film .  in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay ,  itself ,  he acquired the title  " magus "  beyond question .  kubrick's genius is like magic .  the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999 .  among his other outstanding credits are :  eyes wide shut ,  1999 ;  full metal jacket ,  1987 ;  barry lyndon ,  1975 ;  a clockwork orange ,  1971 ;  2001 :  a space odyssey ,  1968 ;  spartacus ,  1960 and many more .   the torrences  ( jack ,  wendy his wife and danny ,  their son )  are living in the overlook hotel for the winter ;  jack has been hired as the caretaker .  it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow ,  until spring when the overlook reopens its doors .  it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway .   the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging .  it lent to the atmosphere ,  by having a dark ,  yet at the same time  " welcoming "  atmosphere ,  itself .  the furnishings and furniture was all period  ( late 70's - early 80's )  ,  and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant .  it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook ,  it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world .   the introduction of wendy and danny's characters was a stroke of genius .  you get the whole story of their past ,  danny's  " imaginary friend ,  "  tony ,  and the story of jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice ,  neat introductory scene .  there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie ;  obviously ,  kubrick saw that from the beginning .   closing day .  again ,  the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel  ( this time ,  with family in tow )  ,  the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange .   the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking ,  even as the  " staff "  is moving things out ,  you get a chance to see the majestic fire places ,  the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings ,  dormants and crown moldings in the architecture .   " they did a good job !  pink and gold are my favorite colors .  "   ( wendy torrence )  even the  " staff wing "  is well designed and beautifully built .   the maze was a magnificent touch ,  reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian .  when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center ,  seeing wendy and danny entering ,  it's a magickal moment ;  one that tells you right away ,  there are heavy energies in that house ;  there's something seriously wrong ,  already starting .   " i wouldn't want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out .  "   ( the hotel manager )   scatman cruthers ,  as dick halloran ,  was genuine and open in his performance .  his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful .  you could actually believe you were there in the hotel ,  taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and  " doc .  "  his explanation of  " the shining "  to danny was very well delivered ,  as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel .  it was believable and sincere .   the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself ,  with the mountains looming behind ,  the cold air swirling about ,  mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel ,  adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie .  it also marks the  " half-way-to-hell "  point ,  so to speak ;  the turning point in the movie .   shelley duvall's portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful .   ( so what if she also played olive oyl ?  !  it just shows her marvelous diversity !  )  honestly ,  before i saw the movie on the big screen in 1980 ,  i said ,  "  what ?  olive oyl ?  *lol*  ( popeye was also released in 1980 .  )  but i took that back as soon as the movie started .  she's brilliant .  in this fiend's opinion ,  this is her best performance ,  to date !   ( although i did love her in steve martin's  " roxanne ,  "  1987 .  )   once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you ,  the viewer ,  need to be in possession :  the torrence's past ;  danny's broken arm ;  tony ;  the history of the hotel itself ;  the fact that danny is not  " mental ,  "  but rather clairvoyant instead ,  and the general layout of the hotel ;  all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences ;  the movie never stops scaring you .   the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker ,  delbert grady  ( the girls having appeared several times to danny ,  first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel )  were icons with which danny could identify ,  and of which he was afraid ,  at the same time .  they were haunting  ( and haunted )  ,  themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed ,  in a rather graphic and material way .   kubrick's tony was written as an attendant spirit ,  like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father .  he was .  .  .  " the little boy who lives in my mouth .  "  he would manifest in the end of danny's finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny .  not like in the book ,  i realize ,  where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy ,  trying to save his father .  kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony  " took  .  .  .  danny  .  .  .  over .  "  the idea of danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't .  .  . scary .   the  " woman in the shower "  scene ,  done by lia beldan  ( about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before ,  or since )  as the younger woman and billie gibson  ( who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since )  ,  was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting .  it was dramatic ,  and frightening .  abhorrent and scary .  when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands ;  the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real .   jack quickly embarks on his trek from the  " jonesing "  alcoholic to a certifiable insane person .  the degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick .  jack's instant friendship with lloyd the bartender  ( as only alcoholics ,  would-be mental patients and drug addicts do )  portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him ;  namely ,  alcohol  .  .  .  " hair of the dog that bit me .  "   ( jack torrence )  in jack's case ,  it's bourbon on the rocks ,  at no charge to jack .   " orders from the house .  "   ( lloyd the bartender )  nice play on words .   when wendy find's jack's  " screenplay "  is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over ,  albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles .  .  . when he asks from the shadows ,   " how do you like it ?  "  and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand .  .  . is so poignant .  it's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is .  .  . how messed up jack is .  it's very scary ,  dramatic and delivers a strong presence .  that coupled with danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood ,  imposed over the scene between jack and wendy ,  and with the confrontational ending to this scene ,  make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie .   the  " redrum "  scene .  wow .  what do i say ?  what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young ,  troubled son standing over them with a huge knife ,  talking in that freaky little voice ,  exclaiming  " redrum "  over and over ?  even if it had no meaning ,  it would still be as scary as the 7th level of hell .  it was something everyone could  ( and has )  remember ( ed )  .  speaking of memorable scenes .  .  .   nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history .  his ad-libbed line ,   " heeeeere's johnny !  "  was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror .  it also goes down in horror movie history .   the ending .  .  ?  kubrick's ending was perfection .  i felt it ended beautifully .  no smarm ,  no platitudinous whining ,  no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie .  just epitomized perfection .  that's all i'll say on the subject of the ending .   who cares what was taken out ?  !  look what kubrick put in .  rent it ,  watch it ,  buy it .  it's a classic in the horror genre ,  and for good reason .  it rawks !  !   *me being me*  .  .  .  take this movie ,  and sitck it in your stephen king collection ,  and take the 1997  " authorized "  version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section .  that's where it belongs .   .  :  this movie rates a 9 . 98 from the fiend  :  . 
slaughter high is intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick .  a prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt .  a few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him .  now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining ,  but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors .   the acting is horrendous ,  however ,  actually not as bad as one would suspect .  though it doesn't help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable .  the lead ,  carol manning  ( caroline munro )  is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she's the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for .  not to mention ,  the geeky guy is almost too geeky and i think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his ,  so when he gets mauled ,  does anyone really care ?    there is much unintentional laughter potential .  munro's lack of acting talent is quite apparent ,  which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast .  however ,  the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose munro ,  who is in her mid 30s at the time ,  as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers .  and then when it comes to later life and munro is playing around her real age ,  the rest of the cast do not pass as adults .  this all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking  " i'll get you .  "  with that being said ,  slaughter high really isn't a very good slasher flick ,  but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it .  perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans ,  but don't expect dilemma ,  suspense ,  or any credibility from it .  horrible !  !  ! 
when i remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it .  it was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview ,  its stunning ,  and then when it comes out ,  you hear nothing and totally miss it ,  and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it .  man on fire was one of those movies .  i was curious on a rental one time ,  and i decided to take it home with me ,  my precious blockbuster rental in my hands .  i watched it ,  and witnessed such a beautiful movie .  it is like none other .  .  . drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular .  the cinematography done by tony scott is extremely well done and unique ,  unlike another movie .  the subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices ,  and the music is very intriguing for the setting .  i got into this movie ,  and ended up buying it as soon as i could scurry out of the household and head over to best buy .  i've watched it several times now .  denzel washington  ( creasy )  does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live .  dakota fanning  ( pita )  puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start .  they bond and become good friends ,  until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood ,  la hermandad .  creasy  ( denzel )  tells the mother of dakota fanning that he will hunt down the killers ,  fearing that pita is dead .  this is where creasy really shows the person he can become .  he uses his contacts from pita's kidnapping and creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit .  my favorite line of all ,  is in this movie ,  when christopher walken tells the afi agent that  " a man is a work of art ,  in anything that he does .  .  .  . cooking ,  whatever .  creasy's art is death .  .  . he's about to paint his masterpiece .  "  he plays a very unique roll of creasy's old partner and friend .  after finally pursuing the brother of  " the voice ,  "  leader of la hermandad .  creasy arranges a meeting to trade pita for himself and the voice's brother .  in the end ,  creasy dies from being shot earlier ,  and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss .  it is a very sincere and sad ending ,  but a great one .  i love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick .  the story is in depth ,  everything is explained from beginning to end ,  and nothing corny at all in any way or manner . 
i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles  ( e . g .  good will hunting ,  the fisher king ,  the world according to garp )  .  these are my favorite robin williams movies .  but seize the day ,  although well-acted ,  is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie  ( even worse than death to smoochy ,  club paradise ,  and alladin on ice )  .   every good story is going to have its ups and downs .  this movie ,  however ,  is one giant down .  i don't need a feel-good hollywood cheese-fest ,  but i've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness .  this movie reminds me of  " love liza "   ( which is actually worse )  because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall .  the answer ?  who cares . 
how ,  in the name of all that's holy ,  did this film ever get distribution ?  it looks as if it has been shot on someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths .  they literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie .  and that's all they do .  there is no plot ,  no tension ,  no characters ,  and not a lot of acting .  just screaming and more screaming .   i gave up after fifteen minutes and fast-wound through it to see if anything happened .  it doesn't - except for screaming ,  of course .  odlly enough ,  the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem - there is no camera-work to speak of .  every shot looks like every other shot - middle distance ,  one angle ,  dull ,  dull ,  dull .   it's not so bad it's good .  it's just plain bad . 
my goodness is this movie bad .  i was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage .  yeah ,  yeah ,  good guys wear white ,  bad guys wear black .  .  .  . and the good guys always win .  now go home and hug your kids ,  and feel how good hollywood has made you feel .  blech !  i can't believe this brain dead movie was made by wes craven .  i'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage ,  so he made this piece of dung .  it is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director .   ya see ,  a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle il' bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy .  but being ms .  all-american girl next door ,  we know she's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys .  .  . the end .  girl power rocks .   c'mon now ,  only an idiot would find this entertaining .  .  .  " a roller coaster ride ,  "  let alone something fresh or new .  all those  " super-duper "  reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick ,  paying back a favor ,  or they have sold their souls to the devil .   rachael mcadams is beautiful .  .  .  . yup ,  that's it .  not a good performance ,  not a horrible one .  .  . she's just cute .  she would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie .  she isn't tough enough to be a good female action lead .   cillian murphy was at least passable in 28 days .  but here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one .  he gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5'' mcadams ,  because after all ,  she was a cheerleader .  .  . and a field hockey player .  .  . and i'm sure she owns all the tae bo tapes .  .  . so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire .  i wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11 .   ya see ,  this movie was done before ,  except before they did it well .  go re-rent any of the die hard movies .  you have loved ones in danger ,  international terrorists ,  except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are way more competent and interesting .  i simply don't understand how hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy .  no wonder movie revenues are down .   throw your $6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you'll never get back .   ciao ,  freddyshoop
this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen .  this is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility  ( like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one )  ,  the cheap sets  ( the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon )  ,  and the bad acting .  it is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus .  however ,  the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box ,  does so at the same time a bank heist is going down ,  at the same fbi agents have been informed of this ,  and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts .  needless to say ,  the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one .  however ,  the results do not make for an enticing action film ,  but instead ,  one that has been obviously z-grade junk from the beginning of the film .   ( perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film )  .  what the hell ron perlman was doing in this ,  i have no idea .  i wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as i was to have watched it . 
i'm sorry ,  but this is such a bad movie it's hilarious .  football hooligans arguing in a travel lodge ?  suits ?  shades ?  !  alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this ,  it is as far from the truth as you can get .   the casting was atrocious .  .  . gary oldman as a football hooligan ?  he doesn't look scary ,  act scary or even come across as someone who would like football .  and as for yeti ?  what the hell ?  suits ,  shades and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting each other with  " its about time you got your nappy on "  .  please .   and the yeti's gang spraying the icc's underwear ?    i don't see how anyone can even take this film seriously !  .   4/10 .  its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism i have ever seen . 
while i loved this movie ,  the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high .   i own the dvd ,  so don't get me wrong ,  i am not saying don't watch it or even buy it !  it's just that i still think the first scene was the best ,  and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it . 
after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making .  the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project .  it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian ( ken burns  ?  )  take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone .  with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced ,  an updated version of this series would be welcome .  the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original .  if you are interested in this era don't miss this series .  it is required viewing . 
bad script ,  bad direction ,  over the top performances ,  overwrought dialogue .  what more could you ask for ?  for laughs ,  it just doesn't get any better than this .  zadora's over-acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the  " hollywood "  machine .  almost as funny as  " spinal tap "  even though it was clearly not intended as such .  don't miss ray liotta's debut film line ,   " looks like a penis .  " 
i really wanted to like this film ,  but the story is ridicules .  i don't want to spoil this film ,  - don't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but here's an example of how sloppy this film was put together .  the cowboy and  " twig "  ride up the ridge .  the cowboy has a handle bar mustache .  the cowboy and  " twig "  get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge .  the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film .  sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave ,  in dark ,  on the back of a horse .   to be fair ,  the acting by the four main characters is solid . 
clean family oriented movie .  i laughed ,  i cried .  .  . i loved it .  i was worried i wouldn't be able to see steve carrell as anything but goofy michael from the office .  boy ,  was i wrong .  he should win an oscar for his performance .  i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out .  my husband enjoyed it and he isn't into movies of this  " type "  .  i saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest .  only 1 cuss word !  not even sure why it was pg13 .  i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy ,  drama ,  romance and more ! 
i enjoyed this movie .  haven't seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly .  i've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he's versatile .   i wasn't troubled that dotty's  " anxiety disorder "  may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook .  there are zillions of whatever-phobias and neuroses ,  and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms .  she is clearly a sensitive with extra-sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos .  it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric .   although this is taken to be a light  " family movie "  ,  it is actually more sophisticated than it seems .  also ,  hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle .  it's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance . 
spoilers sex huh ?  it's one of the most basic parts of human life .  yet ,  do we ever take it too seriously ?  people always want more ,  even those who get it on a daily basis ,  and if you are unlucky ,  there are potential life changing  ( creating )  consequences .  ironically people claim we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age  ( despite victorians getting married and having children in their early teens )  ,  so it must be increasingly difficult for those who get to a point as virgins .  in steve carell's first big screen lead ,  he plays a man who has gotten to 40 without managing it .  treating us to countless lude and extreme sex related incidents ,  not to mention more profanity than an episode of  " eurotrash "  ,  the general plot of the film and it's principle doesn't sound funny .  it's a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate ,  failed jokes ,  there are an incredibly large number of ones which hit the mark and leave the audience in hysterics .   andy stitzer  ( carell )  is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament .  at the same time though ,  he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member ,  andy's friends discover his secret .  at the age of 40 ,  andy is still a virgin .  now ,  for multiple reasons ,  but mostly pity ,  the three men  ( paul rudd ,  seth rogen and romany malco )  all offer andy advice with one goal in mind .  to put him out of his misery and get him laid .   one of the few good things about  " anchorman "  ,  it was only going to be a matter of time before steve carell got himself a lead of his own .  impressively ,  in  " the 40 year old virgin "  he doesn't disappoint .  showing the hopeless ,  shy virgin to perfection ,  carell is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help .   carell is not alone however in his performance .  rudd ,  rogen ,  malco and catherine keener as the love interest are all superb .  rudd is a personal favourite as the love sick david who falls apart at multiple times and shares the finest scene with rogen as the two argue over homosexuality .   the biggest surprise about this film is not the way that so many of the jokes hit the mark ,  but actually the clever way that it flips the message on it's head .  obviously designed for conservative america ,  the film's entire tone evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and abstinence .  the virgin doesn't need sex to make his life complete ,  he just needs confidence and true love .  a worthy message to preach ,  and a considerable improvement on the one you expect to see at the beginning of the film .   it's weird to see a crude comedy which is consistently funny and well acted ,  but low and behold ,   " 40 year old virgin "  is just that .  throw in a well meaning message too and you're well on the way to a top class comedy .  a surprising joy . 
after an initial release of 4 very good eurotrash titles ,  redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance .  i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie .   the story is simple .  a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation .  after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one .  who is the killer ?  who knows ?  there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday .   the pace is excruciating .  the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either .   give this one a miss . 
the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter o'toole's performance .  in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic .  does anybody do it better than o'toole ?  i don't think so .  what a great face that man has !   the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts  ( especially toward the end )  but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels .  however ,  i felt the film basically revolved around peter o'toole's luminous performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it . 
this warning against anti-semitism is well-meant and may have had its purpose at the time ,  but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film .  the director has no idea about mise-en-scene ;  the cast varies from bad till even worse .   the great austrian comic hans moser is wasted .  in his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy ,  that is designed as a set from das kabinett des dr .  caligari ;  one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities .   the restored copy i saw  ( dutch filmmuseum )  gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place ,  but may be the original editing was bad as well . 
the only reason i give this movie 8/10 stars ,  and not 10 ,  is because 1 )  sinatra is awful and 2 )  the love interest of kelly's character leaves much to be desired ,   ( imho )  .  do love that dean stockwell ,  quantum leap - al ,  is the little boy .  the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen .  tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's .  i'm 28 and she's 4 ,  so while the character is less iconic than mickey ,  he is still a favorite of many children and adults today .  kelly is as always captivating ,  his eyes full of fun and excitement .  in every movie i have ever seen him in ,  he always steals the show .  one of the best dancers of the 20th century .  it is no wonder paula abdul  " sampled "  kelly's moves .  i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century .  if you were to watch only one part ,  don't miss kelly's dance with jerry mouse .  you will not be disappointed . 
i've always been a big cybill shepperd fan ,  ever since i saw her series a few years ago !  !  this film certainly shows her in her best light yet !  !  the film was so wonderfully cast and played !  !  every now and again she drops little amusing lines ,  just to make this film one of the best i've ever seen !  !  everybody really out does themselves !  !  especially robert downey jr and cybill shepperd ,  they really made the film come true !  !  also i loved the little bit where mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor !  !  this is film at its best !  ! 
keep in mind i'm a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time .  how i've overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me .  to me this is a better film then the much lauded  " high noon "  .  it's a great western with excellent acting and a great story .  the dvd is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography .  if you like westerns or james stewart this film is not to be missed . 
i am a huge fan of simon pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh .  neither did how to lose friends and alienate people .   this movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off .  however ,  he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous .  but in the end he ends up doing them ,  the culture of life .   the movie is well toned with humor ,  romance ,  good acting and also a bit of a lap dance .  its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends . 
absolutely one of the worst movies of the year .  the plot is ridiculous ,  the characters poorly developed ,  and the premise irritatingly stupid .  it all begins when michael keaton ,  fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since batman ,  loses his beautiful author wife ,  anna ,  to a car accident ,  possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible vw bugs even though she's supposed to be rich .  in his grief ,  batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby :  recording nothing and then watching it .  he learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his tv .  pretty soon ,  he starts to see dead people ,  thanks to evp ,  or electronic voice phenomenon ,  which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders ,  video cameras ,  dead cell phones  (  " anna cell calling ?  but she's .  .  . dead !  .  .  . must be ghosts .  mhmmm .  no other possible explanation .  i'd better start messing around with this indiscriminately .  "  )  etc .  why they can't just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained .  anyway ,  eventually batman discovers that he's actually seeing the future ,  and he decides to go help this woman he doesn't know .  he gets out of his house just in the nick of time ,  because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves  (  " d*mn it !  can travel between the living and dead using electronics ,  but i'll be d*mned if we can be on time !  am i right guys ?   ( they nod in bemused agreement )  .  "  )  .  he tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie  ( look hard ,  or you'll miss him !  )  is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons ,  who in raiders of the lost ark style swoop down and kill him ,  looking like the cartoons that they are .  just then some detectives show up and save the lady .  after batman's funeral ,  he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot ,  evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of evp is to expose him to it .  the little kid just smiles .  nothing phases that dude ,  not even when his dad ,  batman of course ,  starts talking to tv's .  the high-point of the movie was when someone's phone rang and some guy yelled out ,   " it's anna !  " 
i'm getting a little tired of people misusing god's name to perpetuate their own bigoted view on the world .  well i don't dismiss the idea of armageddon ,  or the coming of the anti-christ ,  i do dismiss the idea that only certain people who live truly good lives ( they seem to be mostly white christian children )  will go to heaven ,  while the rest of us must suffer through a millenia of hell on earth ,  just because we weren't good enough .  god may be a judge ,  but i don't think he is going to measure every level of goodness .  give the creator some credit . 
ralph and mumford ,  misfits in their own land ,  get duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch .  twice upon a time is the story of them ,  the characters they meet ,  and their struggle to set things right .  with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business ,  this offbeat movie hits the mark .   the animation process ,  while similar to that of the cut out  " south park "  style ,  is much smoother and far more three-dimensional .  if i didn't know that the animation was this style ,  i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink .  if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx ,  please do !  you won't really miss anything if you don't ,  but if you do ,  you will get much more out of the experience ! 
the only way we survived this stinker was by continually making fun of its stupidity .  funny thing is none of the audience around us seemed to mind--we all joined in .   this movie is soooo bad ,  its only potential is to become a midnight cult movie that people can invent lines and throw popcorn at . 
this movie wasn't just bad - it was terrible .  after i watched it ,  i actually felt the need to take a shower to get the filth off of me .  there is running 'gag' with an elderly couple making out ,  it is not funny ,  but it is disgusting .  the monster make up was cool ,  but that is all .  the continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least i was .  the editing is really poor .   almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie .  even if your group of friends are into 'bad movies' this one is exceptional in its ineptitude ,  i couldn't even bring myself to laugh at it .  you have been warned . 
ever since i started visiting this site ,  and voting for movies ,  i have never given any movie a rating of 1 .  even the disturbing  " dance !  workout with barbie "  got a 2 .  there is a reason for this .   any time i find myself watching what i think is a really bad movie ,  i have to stop and ask myself the following question :   " is this movie really as bad as the horrific soul-sucking beast that is 'theodore rex' ?  "  and i've never been able to answer  " yes "  .   i would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said  " hey !  let's remake 'blade runner' with barney in the harrison ford role !  "  and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film .  furthermore ,  i want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadn't gone strait to video .  this is that rare monster :  a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults .  i'd ask  " what were they thinking ?  "  but in this case ,  it might actually be redundant .   anyhow ,  all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you're one of the five or six rabid fans of  " howard the duck "  ,  or if you are curious to see the most evil insane movie of all time ,  or you want to really punish yourself . 
i was looking forward to kathryn bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 oscars which it was awarded .  unfortunately it really isn't a good movie .  the depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts ,  but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard .  the actors put in a good effort ,  but for me i didn't really get what the movie was trying to be .  it's not as atmospheric and gripping as full metal jacket ,  not as epic as band of brothers ,  not as action packed as .  .  . well ,  anything .  i certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much ,  nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions .  mind you ,  given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years i suppose there's not a lot to choose from . 
i haven't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty .  i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart .  it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters .  ridb roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like ,  messy hair and beard with simple clothing .  also the liam nesson has a celtic look about him ,  he looks like a scot and more importantly looks like rob roy .  it's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace .  gibson is supposedly playing a man who's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter .  the story contains a little romance ,  conspiracy and an underdog story .  sound anything like braveheart ?  but instead of a film that cries out  " freedom "  ,  liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour ,  love and justice .  this makes it a more interesting film .  much like gladiator .  the cast is fantastic and liam nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour .  the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity .  the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic .  this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do .  overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch .  go and see it ! 
one must admit ,  that dev has an eye for beauty and talent .  he gave a break to zeenat aman ,  a successful model ,  and also former winner of beauty pageant's title ,  by casting her in a role ,  which was tailor-made for her debut .  her bespectacled  ,  stoned look ,  and her swaying at the hypnotizing music ,  made her an instant darling of the viewers .  this movie is a treat to the eyes ,  with it's scenic locales ,  ethnic people ,  those buddha temples ,  and chirpy ,  naughty mumtaz ,  who looks quite attractive ,  in her ethnic wear ,  and dancing skills .  dev is of course ,  adorable ,  and this is one of his commercially successful performance .  hare rama manages to keep the interest going ,  with it's carefully written script ,  editing ,  and captivating music .  like des pardes ,  his another movie ,  anand has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction ,  and the theory of them coming from disturbed families ,  and troubled childhood ,  is quite plausible .  a good entertainer ,  this movie retains it's freshness till date  ! 
our imp of the perverse did good his first time out ,  thats for sure .  the music is the best you may ever hear by any human ,  but you already know that ,  unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness .  a poor script that doesn't flesh out much of a story ,  but at least it has its moments .  the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it .  he deserved an oscar for this s**t ,  even though he was at times an ego driven twit ,  with his towering bodyguard chick huntsbery always in front .  a movie that made non-fans fans ,  take it or leave it .  prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though .  he takes himself way to serious .  he is a genius musician ,  but pleaseee .  . just enjoy the ride ,  my purple maestro .  . peace . 
i actually saw china o'brien ii before i ever saw the original china o'brien .  and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse .  but :  worse = funnier !  and funnier = better .  if you're a bad movie fan like i am ,  this is great material .  if ,  however ,  you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot ,  acting ability ,  or movie-making skill ,  this is best avoided .  the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast-forward .  hilariously bad .  see it for a laugh ,  see it for mindless entertainment ,  but whatever you do ,  see it for free on tv . 
collusion course is even worse than the typical  " evil white male corporate capitalist "  movie of the week .  this movie is less pleasant than a toothache .  jay leno can act .  he's good in his underrated debut movie ,  the silverbears ,  in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character .  this movie is so bad leno's character ,  a sanctimonious buffoon ,  is less annoying than morita's character ,  a sanctimonious fool . 
ok .  there are people who should not see this movie .   1 )  don't see it if you don't like satire or black humour .  2 )  don't like it if you got offended by _the watchmen_ .  3 )  don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie .   the rest of you ,  run ,  don't walk ,  to see _mystery men_ .  it's funny ,  it's quirky ,  it's a delightful sendup of every bad superhero cliche known to man .  occasional forays into junior-high humour don't ruin the tongue-in-cheek low-key fun of jeanane garafalo ,  ben stiller ,  and hank azaria ,  as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by geoffrey rush and greg kinnear .   ( good to see louise lasser getting work ,  too .  )  i laughed all the way through .  utterly unserious ,  somewhat weird ,  but -good- . 
i think they really let the quality of the dvd production get away from them .  i rented this dvd from 2 movie stores and the second time i finally got it to play on the 3rd dvd player i tried .   anyone else have this issue ?  it's really hard to give the film an un-biased review after going through such a hassle to play it .  for one ,  i've never seen a finnish horror film before so i was sort of bummed that the movie was done in english .  also since it's never made clear what is wrong with sarah ,  she just came off as retarded and therefore i really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away . 
i've seen this movie ,  when i was traveling in brazil .  i found it difficult to really understand brazilian culture and society ,  because it has so many regional and class differences .  to see this movie in sao paulo itself was a revelation .  it shows something of the everyday life of many brazilians .  on the other side ,  it is sometimes a little bit over-dramatized .  and that's the only negative comment i have on this film .  it's sometimes too much ,  too much sex ,  too many murders and too much cynicism for one film .  the director could film some things a bit more subtle ,  it would make the film more effective .   despite this i liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself .  the characters are complex ,  and very much like real-life people .  not pretty american actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics ,  but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time .  that makes the film realistic ,  even when the story is not that convincing . 
watching this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago ,  and now that i've found it again it still has a film experience like few others .  if risky ,  it's a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids .  while it still holds up as an adult ,  i was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago .  trying to find it today is hard enough  .   .   .  but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age .  anime fans especially will find this a great entry to masami hata's filmography .  with impressive art work and unique designs ,   " chirin no suzu "  represents a worthwhile experience .  while some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in english ,  the musical score is nevertheless captivating .  but even the voice acting is far better than much released today .  unfortunately is went out of print in the mid-1980s from rca columbia home video ,  and has not received any new format release to my knowledge ,  at least in the us .  look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied !  it's an artful ,  intense ,  enjoyable ,  and important landmark in japanese animation . 
this movie is by far the worst movie ever made .  if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film .  i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie .  adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace .  watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender .  anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime .  if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it ,  i'd give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie . 
truly shows that hype is not everything .  shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife .  amitabh as always is solid .  ajay devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke .  the leading lady is such a waste of an actor .  such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry .  with movies as such i have decreased the amount of bollywood movies i watch .   rgv has been making very crappy movies for a while now .  time to get different actors .  hrithek anyone ?  bollywood needs madhuri and kajol back .  every other leading lady is a half-naked wanna be .  pffffft . 
philip .  k .  dickian movie .  and a decent one for that matter .  better than the paycheck  ( woo )  and that abomination called minority report  ( spielberg )  .  but lets face it ,  the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me .  half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending ,  and i was regrettably right .  but that does not mean that the film is not worth its time .  no ,  not at all .  first half  ( as already many here have commented )  is awesome .  there are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future  ( we will do such kind on corny sf things because we can )  or is it simply over combining .  but the paranoia is there and feeling  " out of joint "  also .  good one . 
there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film .  there's not one scary ,  funny ,  or even interesting scene in this film .  it advertises itself as a horror ,  then goes on to call itself a comedy .  it doesn't even attempt humor .  neither does it attempt to be scary .   in order to not be bored by this film ,  you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth .  if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all .  i'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this .  its not funny ,  scary ,  shocking ,  or intriguing .  so was it supposed to be a drama ?  because it really wasn't dramatic either .   please just do yourself a favor and don't watch this film .  life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this . 
fortunately for us real mccoy fans  ( most likely all baby boomers who grew-up in the late 50's and 60's )  ,  three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show ,  in 2000 .  tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter .  as enjoyable as it was to see luke ,  sugar-babe ,  and pepino together again ,  it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman ?  it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 ,  but i'm not sure how .  there is no information about hassie on the internet ,  that i can find .  very curious why they were not even mentioned ?  it was so conspicuous ,  their absence from the reunion show ,  that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself  ( if still alive )  either ,  1 )  requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted ,  or 2 )  tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia  ( like the rest of us )  ,  they seemed to have vanished .  therefore ,  it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together .   otherwise ,  the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done .  they made no bones about it  .  .  .  it was grandpa who made the show such a success .  i remember ,  as a child ,  mimicking grandpa's gimp walk and my parents laughing  ( as i'm sure a million other children did back then )  .  one annoyance that did bother me a bit ,  was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion  .  .  .  at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point .  in fact ,  although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation ,  he was not allowed to speak-out and say too much during the reunion show .  unfortunate ,  since i wanted to hear from all three ,  equally .  all in all ,  the reunion show was a real treat for me .  i've watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time .   dodgerdude
bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film .  this one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes :   " to have and to have not "   ( 1944 )  and  " the big sleep "   ( 1945 )  ,  both of which paired her with humphrey bogart .  granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but i think through no fault of her own .  i think there was some miscasting in having her portray a british upper-crust lady .  no accent whatsoever .  i think all the strange accents were distracting - boyer was certainly no spaniard .  it was hard to keep straight which country people were from .   i really liked the black and white cinematography .  mood is used to great affect - i especially liked the fog scene .  the lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension .   bacall is just gorgeous .  boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and bacall together was a little strange .  not great chemistry - and certainly no bogie and bacall magic .  but i still really liked this picture .  there is great tension and it moves along well enough .  i must say i found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film .   katina paxinou and peter lorre stand out as supporting cast .  paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal .  her one scene where she laughs maniacally as mr .  muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing .  lorre also does quite well in his slimy ,  snake portrayal of conteras - a sleazy coward to the end .  wanda bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time  ( though she appears much younger )  .  turns out she later married auie murphy which proved to be a short lived ,  tempestuous marriage . 
incredibly intriguing and captivating ,  i found it impossible to turn away once i began to watch .  i am usually one of the harshest critics but to me this film was just brilliant ,  strange as this may sound i could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the locations .    from a cinematographic i thought there was great use of light and texture .  from the orange glow of the summer light ,  down to the plastic wrapped couch all had a distinct air of realism to me .   from a character perspective i thought the notion of victor vargas as almost the glue that connects the story was quite inspired ,  each of the other members of the family having a more complete background simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself .   beyond that ,  having known someone just like the grandmother and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation ,  i can say the situation felt particularly realistic .  the awkwardness ,  the accent ,  the cooking and even down to the comments made felt so authentic to me .   i think this film worked for me because i began to watch it with no expectations and found it completely immersing and brought back memories of teenage emotion ,  well worth a watch . 
interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event ,  even though he did save many other captive children .  the film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways ,  bathrooms and even class rooms .  in other words ,  the high school is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal .  dolph lundgren ,  ( sam decker )  plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field .  however ,  the principal asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher .  it is at this point in the film when all hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete bomb .  try to enjoy it ,  if you decided to view it  ! 
think of the ending of the grudge 2 with the following  :   - a man who repeatedly says the word sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - sarah michelle gellar cutting herself - and a creepy mirror  oh and underwater sea animals .  .  . yay .  .  .   not a good movie .  .  .  i seriously did not enjoy it whatsoever .  the poster for the movie is extremely misleading as well and i found that it was just to suck people into watching it .  .  . i can't believe i went .    save your time and money .  .  . go watch saw iii .  .  . a film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into it .  .  .   im mike and im out
 " shore leave "  is mostly an average star trek adventure .  nothing wrong with the episode ,  though .  i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans .  it is lightweight entertaining ,  nothing more .  however ,  i'm glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts .  in this episode ,  kirk decides to grant his crew some time off ,  and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation .  as usual ,  the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be .  there are some action and tense moments ,  but most of the story is played for laughs .  good ,  but unexceptional . 
this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here .  it's a pretty film ,  with nice visuals ,  featuring the scenic beauty of hawaii .   however ,  that was the only redeeming quality for me .  the story was generally boring .  who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the film because her  " picture "  husband is a lot older than he advertised he was ?  granted ,  that could be a bummer .  .  .  .  .  . but get over it !   only in the last 10 minutes does she do an about-face and become fond of him .  by then ,  for most viewers ,  it was too little-too late .  we'd fallen asleep by then . 
this film is not even worth walking to the movie theatre .  no jokes ,  but stupid and boring laughing on repeated disgusting stuff .  the music and the girls are great ,  unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them .  it was weak ,  very very weak . 
this movie surprised me .  some things were  " clicheish "  and some technological elements reminded me of the movie  " enemy of the state "  starring will smith .  but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo  ( providing some comic relief )  .  this is a movie you can watch over again-say .  .  .  some wednesday night when nothing else is on .  i gave it a 9 for entertainment value . 
bela made 9 pics for monogram ,  but it was only at this one ,  the 4th ,  that things started to come together .  all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production ,  writing and character development .  from here on ,  better or worse ,  the series would also deal with one essential theme :  a scientist  ( usually bela )  makes experiments in the basement or the old house  ( sometimes in the basement in the old house )  that causes things to go blooey .  this was also the first time that art director dave milton got a chance to spread his wings .  he came on board for black dragons ,  the flick before ,  but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click .  lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing ,  and was around for all the rest of the monograms .  casting is key in these ,  and it's a pretty good one b movie wise ,  here .  you get barclay and harlen  ( also from black dragons )  , along with russell ,  who would star in lewtons' cat people movies .  . and rosetto ,  from spooks run wild .  .  . a nice slice of poverty row talent .  if you have limited time and budget ,  start with this one .  .  . it sums up everything they had learned up to this point ,  and gives you something to compare the rest to .  the plot ?  bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young .  they both like to sleep in coffins .  if you can read that and smile ,  the rest will be easy . 
this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences .  its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads .  chasing the big murder case ,  you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime .  no nudity ,  but lots of sexual implication ,  slapstick silliness .  .  . everything adolescents go for .  low budget ,  but very entertaining .  definite cult classic potential . 
out of these pokemon films  ( which are in order of best to least for me )  :  pokemon the first movie ,  pokemon 4ever ,  pokemon heroes ,  pokemon 200 and pokemon :  entei and the unknown ,  this is probably the one most concerning the environment ,  arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one .  whether these are good points for you or not ,   " pokemon 4ever ,  "  still has entertained many .   as well as the three points covered above ,  this pokemon film includes good humour and good cgi  ( as well as anime )  .  the time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and team rocket  ( the comic reliefs/rubbish baddies )  end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks .    the flaws are ,  as always ,  the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting ,  even more so than a few pokemon film baddies .    a strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest .  a young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere .  .  .   meanwhile ,  ash ,  brock and misty are entering a large forest .  .  .   curious ?  watch the rest .  .  .   good for all pokemon fans and  " american "  anime movie fans ,  enjoy  " pokemon 4ever "  !   : - ) 
in contrast to my fellow reviewers ,  i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see . yes ,  the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal ,  the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping . something must be lost in the translation of the word  " bloodsucker "  from the italian in the title ;  almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence ,  so tacked it onto the film anyway .   this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film ! now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - italian softporn from the mid 1970s . i bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli  ( credited most often as  " krista nell "  )  . the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s . i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list ,  it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned . i think krista nell played  " cora "  but underneath that massive hair style ,  costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure .   there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out . maybe something is lost in the dubbing process . what were the positive points ? well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there . the external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island . it purports to be set in  " ireland "   ( north or the republic ?  ) in 1902 ,  so everyone sports period piece costumes . some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes !  ! anyway an enjoyable romp . i rated it 4/10 . 
i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open-ended and left unexplained ,  and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way ,  plus scenes of a decaying corpse .    neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner .   the film's plot ,  such as it is ,  concerns three loosely interconnecting stories ,  none of which conclude satisfactorily .   the bounty hunter ,  played by bruce dern ,  is the character that connects all three vignettes .   first we have dylan mcdermott ,  looking darn fine ,  as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter ,  when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl played by helen hunt .   then we have one of the hemingway girls ,  not sure which one ,  playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman ,  an attractive redhead ,  whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long .   the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him ,  with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension . 
it's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds .  meryl streep gives the performance of her life ,  melodramatic ,  overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror .   if comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and ,  yes ,  it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving streep a showcase for her aussie accent and facial contortions .    throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad . 
if you fast forward through the horrible singing ,  you will find a classic fairy tale underneath .  christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role .  his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots .  the other actors are well for their parts .  i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward .  the king in particular appears a real dunce though ,  and i wonder if he is supposed to be .  i can not remember the original tale .  the special effects are typical of the eighties ,  but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today .  overall ,  i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart . 
if you loved deep cover ,  you might like this film as well .  many of the poetic interludes fishburne recites in deep cover are from the lyrical script of  " once in the life ,  "  a screen adaptation of a play that fishburne wrote .  if you love larry as much as i do ,  you'll love this film that is all larry ,  all hot ,  and all fleshed out .  of course there is gun play and illicit substance use ,  this is a gangster movie of sorts ,  after all ,  but the script is beautiful and the story is touching ,  even a little on the chick flick side .   amazing film .  .  . dark ,  frightening ,  sexy ,  and exciting .  if you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse ,  you'll get the proper impact of the cramped sets  ( metephorically echoing being trapped in the life )  .  full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships ,  this film is tight .  . every sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots .  good work ! 
cq could have been good ,  campy fun .  but it commits the only unforgivable sin :  it is b-o-r-i-n-g !  the pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it's next to impossible to care where it's going .  the story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label :   " caution :  student film .  fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker .  " 
my favorite  " imperialism "  movie and one of the best action-adventure flicks of all time .  grant ,  mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daring-do and wise cracks to please all but the most  " pc "  of film goers .  memorable scenes abound -- the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting off hundreds of thugs ;  macchesney & cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch  (  " save some for the elephant "  )  ;  cutter to macchesney --  " i'm an expedition "  ;  din breaking cutter out of jail ,  with a fork  (  " what do you think i'm trying to break out of ?  a bleedin' pudding ?  !  )  and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing ,  bold as brass --  " all right ,  you're all under arrest !  "   i could go on ,  but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on .  for armchair adventurers and generals ,  it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours . 
this movie started out with some semblance of a plot ,  then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward .  it was impossible to remain engaged with this film .  this movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability .  it is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio .  clearly there are morale and motivation problems at disney ,  not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control .  that management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation .  this movie joins my very short  " worst movies of all time "  list . 
if you are the sort of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie ,  then i highly recommend this one .  if you aren't ,  stay away .  this is an astonishingly cheap-looking movie ,  and at times you may find yourself wondering if it isn't just a prank someone is pulling on you .  the most positive comment i can make about it is that the people responsible seemed to realize that it was super-low-budget nonsense ,  so there is at least a sense of fun here .   but this is as amateurish as it gets .  their idea of giant killer mushrooms are simply guys covered with beige colored sheets with what looks like trash can covers on their heads .  it's obviously not meant to be taken seriously  ( to say the least )  ,  but even with that disclaimer you'll find yourself shaking your head at the awesome cheesiness of it all .  or laughing out loud frequently ,  as i did . 
oh ,  i heard so much good about this movie .  went to see it with my best friend  ( she's female ,  i'm male )  .  now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream .  after the first couple of dozen  " take off your clothes ,  "  we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom .  we laughed  ( at it ,  not with it )  ,  we dozed  ( and would have been better off staying in bed )  ,  we were convinced we had spent money in vain .  and we had .  the plot was incoherent ,  and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care .  a waste of money ,  a waste of celluloid .  this movie doesn't even deserve one out of ten votes ,  but that's the lowest available .  i'm not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent ;  i don't recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence . 
its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book .  this poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails .  it fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one  ( except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films )  .   the only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an omen v . 
i saw this movie on the film festival of rotterdam  ( jan '06 )  and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards .  many people reacted shocked and protesting .  he will get a lot of negative critics .  but :  the world is cruel like this ,  and it's not funny .  people don't like it .  that itself doesn't mean that the movie is bad .  i can see that difference .  don't shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our 'hubble' !  nevertheless i think this a bad movie .  film-technically it's a good one .  nice shots and script ,  most good fitting music ,  great actors .  the director pretends to make a psychological movie ,  - the psychology however is of poor quality .  describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art .  the art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence .  how does a shy boy come to such a cruelty ?  the director pretends to describe that ,  - but is not good in that .   the director used several times the word the 'selfishness' of people ,  mentioning for instance the teacher .  only :  this teacher wasn't selfish , - just someone in several roles ,  caring for his pupils ,  ánd worried about his script .  i think it's a simplification to call him selfish .  the atmosphere in the village is creepy ,  and the mother made awful mistakes  ( 'you terribly let me down' )  but it doesn't become believable for me ,  that there is caused súch a lot of pain ,  that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things .  in fact ,  reality is far more complex than the way ,  this film describes  and it needs far better descriptions .  the interesting thing would be :  how does it work ?  describe that process for me please ,  so that we understand .   with the written phrase on the end ,  the director said to point to an alternative way of life .  it was the other extreme ,  and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists ,  promoting black/white-thinking .  the connection between violence in films and in society has been proved .  use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right .  there are enough black/white-thinkers in the world ,  causing lots of war and misery .  i hope ,  this movie won't be successful . 
i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it  ( and they are not pervs !  )  as a must see .  and it is a must see !  just don't expect to see something outbreaking .   the freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film ,  but there's just too much perversion and it doesn't stick in the end .   some of the good things are the analyzes of kieslowski's blue ,  most of david lynch's ,  some of hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more i missed  ( i just remembered .  .  . dogville )  ,  and i usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air .   other than being repetitive ,  which makes it too long ,  the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious ,  hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory .   i really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of mr .  zizek to revive freud's theory ,  which has been numb for too long ,  specially in north america .  again ,  it's way over the top and i believe not to be a completely waste of time for i do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood . 
jack frost is really a cool movie .  i mean .  .  .  . its funny .  its violent .  and very enjoyable .  most people say that it is b rated ,  but that couldn't be farther from the truth .  it has great special effects and good acting .  the only weird thing is of course ,  the killer snowman .  i think this movie was actually one of the best films of the late-nineties .  most films these days lack the criteria of a clive barker master piece .  that is ,  be original and give the viewer what they do not expect .  jack frost is very cool .  10 out of 10 .  grade :  a+ .  ed also recommends the movie uncle sam to fans of jack frost . 
honestly ,  when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off .  as i sat there for the next 10 minutes or so ,  i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show .  his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn't been in more comedies .  he has this  " marty feldman "  thing going for him but much ,  much more talent .  .  . taking nothing away from marty .  the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk ,  but then again ,  it was so much more .  i really think that if this movie was released first ,  and i saw the steve martin movie 2nd ,  i'd think the 2nd was a cheap rip-off .  i know it sounds like a bold statement ,  but it's true .  i actually like steve martin a great deal ,  but his performance is 2nd to the actor in the jerk too .  i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection .  i urge you to see it if you can find it . 
an overblown melodrama typical of its period  ( mid-1950s )  and appropriate matinée food .  rock hudson ,  the hulk everyone always falls in love with ,  plays his usual stereotype role ,  but whereas in giant ,  made the same year ,  when his material and co-stars  ( taylor & dean )  were above average ,  in this movie he is just not good enough to raise the calibre beyond a mushy tale of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy .  the self-destructive brother and sister  ( robert stack ,  reeling his way through the film in a drunken stupor ,  and dorothy malone ,  playing a vampish poor little rich girl totally over the top )  end up the losers and hudson gets bacall - who is rather wooden in this part which does not have enough character or wit to get her going .  to paraphrase oscar wilde ,  the good end happily and the bad unhappily ,  that is the meaning of fiction .  however ,  i was interested to read that the film is based on a true story which vindicated the plot .  like other films of the period ,  homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms .  maybe the film could be remade :  stack's character would ring truer if he was hiding homosexual feelings for mitch by marrying .  todd haynes's far from heaven greatly improved on all that heaven allows  ,  also directed by sirk .  perhaps haynes could remake written on the wind and give us a truly memorable film . 
according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel mccrea ,  audie murphy ,  and randolph scott ,  the author says that albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost .  hadn't been seen in years .   good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it's out on the open market .  albuquerque is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family feud with uncle george cleveland .   george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business ,  headquartered in the fast growing settlement of albuquerque .  cleveland is more than just a business owner ,  he's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair .  he even has the sheriff in his pocket .    randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing .  that includes not backing relatives up when they're villains .  he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig .   cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western mata hari in the person of barbara britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals .  barbara's great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda .   randolph scott's original home studio was paramount ,  it was where his first studio contract was with .  albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one .   note also lon chaney ,  jr .  ,  who is george cleveland's chief henchman ,  a rather loathsome bully of a man and gabby hayes ,  who is just gabby hayes .   albuquerque must have been loved by republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair .  a certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone .  they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too ,  but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in albuquerque .  i'm not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot .  my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to .   still albuquerque must have had great appeal to the gop market . 
this is a great idea for a film but it ,  unfortunately ,  doesn't turn out to be a great movie .  what starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a fluffer in love with his fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots ,  with liberal borrowings from boogie nights ,  thelma and louise ,  showgirls ,  frisk ,  and even a curious  " dash "  of 400 blows thrown in towards the end .   ( at least the director did his research !  )  the result is not necessarily boring but ,  in the end ,  this slick ,  well-produced flick doesn't quite add up to anything .  however ,  the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind-the-scenes world of gay porn .   
marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england .  what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element . this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as  " mrs .  miniver "  and  " hope and glory .  "  as is the case with this film ,  we see the desperation of people in the time of war .   the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw ,  who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombing .   we soon see why this child wets his bed .  he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly .   the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life .  when the child is returned to his mother ,  the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy .  he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home .   the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships . 
this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists .  it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author's subsequent opus ,  *collapse* .   diamond himself comes off as personable and caring ,  not just a disinterested or disengaged academic .  this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to  " publish or perish ,  "  as the saying goes about academe ,  but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects ,   " why you white people got so much cargo ,  and we have so little ?  "  because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community ,  diamond looked for an answer that didn't insult that intelligence or that community .  i like to think of his answer in a very simple way ,  in the same spirit as  " south park's "   " blame canada "  :   " blame wheat !  " 
monstervision was a show i grew up with .  from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one ,  the only ,  joe bob briggs .  the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years ,  and provided some of the best drive-in memories to ever come outside of the drive-in .   without a doubt ,  the best late night television ever .  if you didn't stay up ,  you were missing out .   i know john bloom and joe bob live on ,  but i want them back where they belong .  .  . monstervision !  question .  .  . did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of  " the swarm "   ?  q :  )   long live monstervision ! 
oh my god ,  what a horrible film .  the film has all the right people involved ,  unfortunately it is not worth watching .  i saw it for free at my local library .  if i had paid to watch this i would be even more upset .  this film is unwatchable .  how could tarintino be involved with such a slow paced ,  unexciting film .  no wonder it didn't get much distribution ,  every one involved must have been ashamed .  i can make a better film with a dated camcorder and my big toe .  its beyond boring ,  i really hated it .  tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes .  this must be some kind of sick joke .  don't bother with this film .  if some one even hints you should watch it ,  kill them . 
 " proximity "  tells of a convict  ( lowe )  who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him .  this very ordinary film is an action/drama with a weak plot ;  stereotypical ,  poorly developed characters ;  and a one dimensional performance by lowe .  a forgettable film not worthy of further commentary . 
i simply cant understand why all these relics from the ceausescu era refuse to let go .  one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies ,  and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy-fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating ,  urinating ,  vomiting ,  swearing ,  and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable .  this is not cinema ,  friends and neighbors !  this is simply visual perversion .  forget about bunuels chien andalou ,  about david lynch ,  about forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness .  those people were mastering their jobs - well ,  you don't !  do us a favor ,  all you daneliucs and nicolaescus and saizescus and muresans and marinescus and margineanus and other obsolete old-timers ,  and leave us alone !  its bit time to see some romanian movies on screen ,  enough with your immature terribilisms !  you are not directors ,  you are illiterate !  !  ! 
what makes for best picture material ?  the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly ,  and ignoring the  " auteurs "  who would be deified in decades to come .  it wasn't because hollywood was against art or creativity .  the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself ,  and that is why ,  at least in the classic era ,  they tended to reward the greatest collaborations ,  the most sensational meetings of creative minds .   the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar-winning glory for several years by this point ;  it was only a matter of time before freed ,  aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business ,  would land a best picture .  freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else ,  crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals .  the point about freed musicals ,  is that the lyrics of the songs ,  unlike those of hammerstein or lerner ,  don't have to tell or even relate to the stories .  what's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film .   an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals  ( the other two being singin' in the rain and the band wagon )  which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story .  the words don't fit the plot ,  but the routines fit the show .  so ,  when gene kelly sings i got rhythm ,  he hasn't even got a girl yet ,  but the way it's done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation ,  and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point .  an american in paris also uses the rule-breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story ,  such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron's character .   and what better director for this project than minnelli ,  himself a painter and a pianist ?  at this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor .  while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades ,  minnelli's colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced .  in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted ,  but not drab ,  and in particular there is an absence of red .  during oscar levant and georges guetary's meeting in the café ,  a few more vibrant shades are introduced .  then ,  during the first musical number ,   " by strauss "  minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth ,  a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates ,  as if the song has awoken the picture's colour scheme .  for most of the songs ,  the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people .  however ,  in some numbers ,  such as  " tra-la-la "  he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated .   the achilles' heel of an american in paris is its story .  i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable ,  playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s ;  the headstrong ,  independent woman gets rejected while the meek ,  delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero .  even if you don't mind that ,  it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances .  compare this to singin' in the rain ,  which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set-pieces as an american in paris ,  but it has a winning storyline .  singin' in the rain was overlooked at the 1952 oscars ,  yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today .  but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all-encompassing form of visual entertainment ,  not just a means of telling a story .  an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear-jerking but ,  like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year ,  it certainly is a great show . 
i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it .  the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie .  i've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the 'master of suspense' himself ,  but so far i haven't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time .  in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some  ( cheap )  thrillers ,  but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie .  normally it's the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcock's name if that can raise their income .  but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman .  that's why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that i'm glad that i did .    " sur mes lèvres "  or  " read my lips "  as it is called in english ,  tells the story of a young secretary named carla .  she is a hardworking and loyal employee ,  but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues .  that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency ,  which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company .  but when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her ,  all this is about to change .  paul angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex-convict .  the man is a thief ,  but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed .  she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like ,  but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life .  .  .   since i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller - which this movie definitely is - i will not make any comparisons between hitchcock and jacques audiard's directing .  fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie .  i hadn't heard of him before ,  but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end .  that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course .  i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role ,  instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband  ( you know ,  the typical tv-movie story )  .   also worth noticing is the acting in this movie .  vincent cassel is quite famous ,  but emmanuelle devos was a complete mystery to me .  there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles ,  but they both did an excellent job with their characters ,  making them feel very believable and realistic .  paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman ,  but thanks to their performances ,  you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together .   all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting .  despite the fact that i had my doubts about it ,  i've soon become one of its greatest admirers .  i give this movie an 8/10 .  don't hesitate to give it a try . 
i had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining ,  like other sorts of its genre .  however ,  it was lame and i didn't find myself laughing very much .  watch it on hbo ,  maybe ,  or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time .  but i don't recommend paying to see it .   the plot is simple and straightforward ,  and it could have been funny ,  maybe ,  if the script was better .  jason lee can be hilarious ,  and he gets a few laughs here and there ,  but the movie falls flat .  just don't go see this one .  the directing is lackluster ,  but for what it is ,  directing isn't that important .  i guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny .  see something else ,  don't waste your time here . 
i agree with most of the other guys .  a waste of photons and valuable time .   nearly no joke is worth the paper is was written on .  the only highlight from my pov is olli dittrich as pinocchio .   (  " egal ,  ich muss eh waldsterben "  )  this reminds of old times with rtl samstag nacht .  it is hard to describe the performances of the actors ,  since most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just  " do their thing "  .  camera is ok ,  plot is laughable ,  i think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of beers .   apart from this i yawned all the time ,  wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end .   my 9 year old son was pleased ,  but then he is pleased by so little at this age  : - )   anyway ,  a 1 point rating here nearly is 1 point too much .  .  . 
with this film ,  bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity' .  obviously ,  it is not .  for one reason ,  many scenes 'shot by pure chance' are obvious set-ups  ( when that poor goat 'accidently' falls off the cliff ,  you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen !  )  .  for another ,  his concealing of one important information :  the hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film .  that is ,  goitre ,  a sickness caused by lack of iodine  ( salt )  .  this goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had bunuel only took the time to make his research  ( heck ,  if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he'd have found 'goitre' )  he might have ended up telling the truth about these people  ( still ,  doubtfully )  .  instead ,  with his film ,  he judges them constantly ,  talking about them as 'cretins' ,  again and again ,  dramatizing the action ,  setting-up scenes to create the spectacle ,  all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all-mighty objectivity .  bunuel talks all the time in this film ,  not letting one word to the people he is filming .  he talks for them and ,  even then ,  judges them .  this piece is flawed to it's roots ,  to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film . 
have just finished watching this film ,  which upset me greatly .  have also been to south africa twice ,  around the time this film is set .   it is certainly hard-hitting ,  and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene' .  the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break ,  and there are certainly few light moments .   will never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again .  he came across as a very twisted individual ,  and i found myself disliking him more each time he appeared .   totally agree with steve-thomp's articulate and well thought-out comments . 
if the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless ,  one might well refer to  " ned kelly "  as an  " australian western .  "  for the people down under ,  ned kelly was ,  apparently ,  a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood ,  jesse james ,  bonnie and clyde ,  and butch cassidy and the sundance kid .  the descendant of irish immigrants ,  kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer ,  a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison .  to get back at the government for this mistreatment ,  kelly ,  his brother dan ,  and two other companions ,  became notorious bank robbers ,  winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country .   perhaps because we've encountered this  " gentleman bandit "  scenario so many times in the past ,   " ned kelly "  feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown .  ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and ,  even then ,  only with the deepest regret .  he also has the pulse of the common folk ,  as when ,  in the middle of a bank robbery ,  he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers ,  after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it .  what movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that ?  it's acts of selective generosity like this ,  of course ,  that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo .  geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment .  there's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers ,  so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle .  and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another .   heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role ,  providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging .  it doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film .    " ned kelly "  might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history ,  but as an entertainment ,  it's just the same old story told with different accents . 
normally ,  i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest .   you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet .  .  .  well ,  this movie was just terrible .  it is nigh on impossible to  " suspend disbelief "  ;  i tried ,  really ,  i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn't let me .    timberlake should stick to music ,  what a dreadful performance - no presence as an actor , no character .  can't blame everything on justin :  the movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing ;  its definitely an  " f "  .   after seeing this ,  i have to wonder what really motivates actors .  i mean ,  surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part .  did he not see how poor it was ?  what then could motivate him to take the part ?  money ?  of course ,  acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work .    ll cool j is a great actor ;  he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script .    meanwhile ,  the audience goes :   " what the hell is going on here ?  you expect me to believe this crap ?  "   in short ,  apart from justin a great lineup badly executed - very disappointing . 
there are a lot of highly talented filmmakers/actors in germany now .  none of them are associated with this  " movie "  .   why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this ?  you could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage !  it's not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dwarfs ,  pretending to be funny .  what is funny though is that the film's producer  ( who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch )  is playing the youngest dwarf .   the film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying  " you're supposed to laugh now !  "  .  it's hard to believe that this crap's supposed to be a comedy .   many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie .  i should have done the same instead of wasting my time .  .  .   pain ! 
upon viewing tobe hooper's gem ,  crocodile ,  in 2000 ,  i developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre .  i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness .  if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts .  with ed writing the scripts ,  and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer ,  all we'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants .   while tobe hooper's crocky opus referenced his own movies ,  blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies .  see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages ? /rip-offs to jaws ,  temple of doom ,  indiana jones' last crusade ,  the convent ,  godzilla 2000 ,  and any james bond movie .  also ,  try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock .   i was disappointed the crock didn't get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism .  .  . or crocky appreciation ,  but the quasi-captain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach .  perhaps ,  in the coming years ,  we'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset .  or hopefully ,  a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-g monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed .   all-in-all ,  the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me . 
jane austen's emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen .  kake beckinsale's emma is irreproachable .  gwyneth paltrow ,   ( with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography )  is able to bring out the comedy effectively ,  she fails to make emma likeable .  paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong' for the part  ( and i believe the era )  and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses .  kate beckinsale ,  on the other hand ,  manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly  ( the most romantic of jane austen's heroes )  actually sees in her .  mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks ,  an appropriate age ,  chivalry ,  compassion and gentlemanly behaviour .  emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful . 
this first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement ,  romance ,  and james stewart to the screen .   " the far country "  is the only one out of all five stewart-mann westerns that is often overlooked .  stewart ,  yet again ,  puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five stewart-mann westerns .  jeff webster  ( stewart )  is uncaring ,  always looking out for himself ,  which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him .  ironically ,  he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without .  this displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick ,  ben tatum ,  played by walter brennan ,  since tatum is the one that gave it to him .  mann ,  yet again ,  puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart-mann westerns .  he displays violence ,  excitement ,  plot twists ,  romance ,  and corruption .  the story is that jeff and ben ,  through a series of events ,  wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson ,  along with gold partners calvet and flippen ,  and no-good but beautiful roman and her hired men .  they are unable to leave ,  because crooked sheriff mr .  gannon  ( mcintire )  and his  " deputies "  will hang them ,  since the only way out is through skagway ,  which is gannon's town .  but ,  eventually ,  mcintire comes to them ,  but not to collect stewart and/or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government .  what is mcintire there for ?  he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money .  people are killed .  a sheriff for dawson is considered needed ,  and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun .  stewart ,  however ,  refuses the job ,  because he plans to get all the gold he can ,  and then pull out .  he also refuses it because he does not like to help people ,  since law and order always gets somebody killed .  so ,  flippen is elected instead .  a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon's men ,  a purely evil ,  mustachioed fancy gunman named madden ,  who carries two guns ,  played by wilke .  flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done ,  but he cannot stand up to him ,  so he becomes the town drunk .  a man named yukon replaces flippen .  stewart and tatum start to pull out ,  but are ambushed by gannon's men .  tatum is killed ,  and stewart is wounded .  stewart finally realizes that he must do something ,  or gannon will take over dawson ,  set up his own rules ,  and it will become his town ,  just like skagway .  the audience also realizes what stewart must do .  another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon .  if stewart leaves ,  gannon would take over the town .  if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it ,  the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly .  this is where a great scene occurs .  stewart walks into his cabin .  he has a sling on his arm .  for a few seconds ,  his gun ,  in the gunbelt ,  is hanging on a post beside his bed ,  the gun is close up ,  stewart is in the background ,  just inside the door .  he stares at it for a few seconds .  he tosses the sling away .  the sling lands on the back of a chair ,  and falls to the floor .  this is symbolic ,  because he is throwing away his old life ,  which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself .  he comes into his new life ,  of helping people when they need help .  what ends the film is a guns-blazing ,  furious show of good against evil ,  and a genuinely feel-good feeling that everything will be alright . 
umm .  .  i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks .   lets face it .  .  .  tori spelling is not a great actress .  .  and this movie just proves the extent of her  " talent "  .  the movie's plot was weak .  .  .  i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom .  if there is a good thing about this movie ,  i would say it's that tommy chong's daughter ,  just for the fact that she's his daughter .  .  .  and then there is that soap-opera-ish male lead who's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive ,  but ceases to help his dramatic abilities .  *why does imdb require at least 10 lines ?  how many more ways can you simply say  " this movie sucks "  ? 
i wont take too much time here ,  just wanted to state that darkman 3 is awesome .  i have all 3 on dvd ,  added these to my collection of dvd movie sets .  darkman ranks up there with the best ,  like indiana jones ,  aliens ,  star wars ,  die hard ,  you get the point .  there isn't too many good horror ,  thriller ,  sets out there .  many thanks to the whole crew ,  and set for giving us the darkman trilogy .  by the way if your wondering how i came across this one on dvd .  i purchased it through the internet ,  it is however region 4 ,  as you know most us dvd players are region 1 .  if you own a sony playstation 2 ,  you have the best dvd player since it is an all region player .  just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want  (  1-9  )  . 
hare rama hare krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971 .  filmed almost entirely in kathmandu ,  the capital of nepal ,  the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family ,  but also a relationship between a brother and a sister ,  as well as drugs and the hippie movement ,  which made many people think that it involved the iskon - the movement for krishna consciousness .   the movie begins with scenes of drugs and being informed that the woman dancing in front is the narrator's sister .  going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing .  this soon leads to a split in the family .  the brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father .   as years pass ,  the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to nepal .  here ,  prashant ,  the brother not only finds love ,  but he also finds his sister ,  janice .  but he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past .  with help of shanti ,  his love ,  the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles ,  including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him this is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself ,  dev anand and also stars zeenat aman  ( her first movie )  ,  mumtaz ,  rajendranath ,  prem chopra ,  jnr mehmood ,  a . k .  hangal and achala sachdev .  the music is superbly provided by the late r . d .  burman ,  whose last score was  " 1942 - a love story .  "  during the filming ,  dev anand asked panchamda  ( r . d .  burman )  to compose something special for this film .  days later panchamda came back with the composition of  " dum maro dum .  "  the song was an instant hit . 
my first opinions on this movie were of course bad . i was expecting a horrible ,  crappy acting ,  bad entertainment ,  ridiculous special effects movie . what i got was actually not that bad . the special effects were absolutely horrible ,  but i found the movie itself quite interesting ,  and the script was actually pretty good and decent . the acting wasn't that bad ,  and overall i had fun watching this movie . it's still a pretty bad film ,  but it's not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be ,  and i'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me ,  even when it wasn't that good . overall ,  it's a film that should be avoided ,  but to me it wasn't as bad as i was expecting it to be . 
what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters ?  the major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together .  it's simple and really efficient .  the background story is less important .  why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller ?  it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french film-jerkers like to make .  not too much ambition ,  right :  sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization .   for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy .  it goes quite as easy as in rear window  ( an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film )  but with a less compelling context .  where i am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased .  he brings very little to the story ;  when he appears alone we wonder if we've not missed a part before .  jacques audiard is not a new-comer yet .  strange and weird . 
of all the movies i have seen ,  and that's most of them ,  this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the u . s .  naval airships  ( blimps )  during the ww-ii era .  yes there are other good lta related movies ,  but most use special effects more than any real-time shots .  this man's navy has considerably more real-time footage of blimps etc .  true ,  lots of corny dialog but that's what makes more interesting hollywood movies ,  even today .  p . s .  i spent 10 years ( out of 20 )  and have over 5 , 000 hours in navy airships of all types ,  from 1949 through 1959 .  proud member of the naval airship association etc .

this movie is flawed on many fronts .  like many before it ,  it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history .  the production is poor ,  overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares .  this to me was the greatest flaw - i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude .   as a native texan ,  i grew up with the mythology .  i later learned more about the history .  i can accept a decent production from either perspective  ( although i prefer more historical accuracy )  ,  but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it .  even john wayne's or fess parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess ,  while being only slightly less accurate .   very disappointing - avoid it . 
excellent view of a mature woman ,  that is going to lose everything  ( even the pruner has a mortgage )  .  the way she gets involved into this special  " business "  ,  the innocence ,  and the true love that exists between the people of a little town ,  it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh ,  light and funny comedy .  i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore .   i love european films ,  and with movies like this one ,  my opinion grows stronger .  a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed ,  in this same genre ,  is waking ned devine .   saving grace ,  a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself .  you will love it . 
went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4 .  unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it .  the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn't see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks .   too cartoonish and very disappointing . 
this film looked interesting ;  i'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly .   started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations .  in fact ,  i didn't bother watching the whole thing .  .  .  utter drivel - bad performances ,  bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters - that was the point of the film ,  i guess .   watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend .   do not bother with this feature . 
in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th ,  valentine fails .  why did people like halloween ?  because it was original ,  new and went beyond anything that's ever been done .  why did they like scream ?  because at least it made sense .  valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever .  the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it's not funny .  and the moment the killer comes on screen ,  you know who it is ,  it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable .  the teen slasher genre is dead get over it !   0 out of 10
 " i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing !  "  the small town sheriff laments .    " this happens a lot in chicago ?  "  his deputy asks .   well ,  no ,  not really .  the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles' war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion ,  and conclude they need to get in on the action !  what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martian's haphazard attempts to conquer the town of  " big bean ,  il "  .  everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes ,  except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend ,  a kid in a duck suit .   the martians themselves are comical ,  and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on .  it's a fun family movie . 
i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me .  laputa ,  whose title seems to have affected its release in the u . s .  to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences ,  has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production conan .  in fact ,  pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet ,  then started running .  this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch .  the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa--the only exception may be the robot .  unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds ,  the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism .  if it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare .  the importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle ,  is dismissably shortly discussed ,  and not really followed through .  overall ,  i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny . 
when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers ,  it was films like the garden of allah .  how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me .  also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me .   the garden of allah ,  one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12 .  it then got two silent screen adaptions .  the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world .  he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent .  she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train .   the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer .  i'm not sure what was in david o .  selznick's mind in filming this story .  someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience .  but you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title .  the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting .   as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret .  the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves .  the monks are a sincerely pious group ,  but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest .   anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts .  most especially marlene dietrich .  i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot . 
i'd read about flavia the heretic for many years ,  but i only got to see it early last year ,  when i went on an insane movie-buying binge ,  and ,  for whatever reason ,  it has been on my mind lately ,  though it's been some months since i watched it .   it's a striking film ,  set in italy somewhere around the 15th century .  definitely medieval-era  ( though i don't think any specific year is ever given )  .  this being the time of christian ascendancy ,  the age is a time of utter madness ,  and the movie captures this very well .   flavia ,  our protagonist ,  is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield .  he seems a warm and intriguing fellow ,  and she's immediately taken with him .  her father ,  a soldier of a a family of some standing ,  comes along ,  almost immediately ,  and murders the wounded man right before her eyes .  but she'll continue to see him in her dreams .   her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open-air insane asylum--the residents ,  so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity ,  slowly go mad .  flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns .  but in a mad world ,  only the sane are truly mad ,  and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her .  her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia ,  who ,  being young and apparently sheltered ,  is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped .   the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world ,  showcasing a lot of unpleasantness .  we see a horse gelded ,  a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig-sty ,  the pious torture of a young nun .  through it all ,  flavia observes and questions ,  rejecting ,  eventually ,  the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic .  i disagree with that criticism .  flavia's views ,  though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror ,  for example ,  then-contemporary feminist commentary  ( the movie was made in 1974 )  ,  revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions .  it is ,  perhaps ,  difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time ,  but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to belabor .  flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era ,  or of any era ,  to empathize with her plight .  getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees .   flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive ,  invading the countryside ,  and she finds ,  in their leader ,  a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams .  smitten with her almost immediately ,  he allows her to virtually lead his army ,  becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle-gear ,  and directing the invaders to pull down christian society ,  and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil .   is she the herald of a new and better world ?  she may think so ,  but muslims of that era weren't big on feminism ,  either ,  as she soon learns the hard way .  as they say ,  meet the new boss .  .  .   this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic .  the movie is quite grim ,  and with a very downbeat ,  rather depressing ending .  not a mass-audience movie at all ,  to be sure .  it's quite good ,  though ,  and doesn't belong on the  " nunsploitation "  pile on which it is often carelessly thrown .  i think there's much value in the final film ,  and i'm glad i saw it . 
at first i was convinced that this was a made-for-tv movie that wasn't worthy of primetime .  but after a few minutes of dumb-struck awe ,  i realized that there was at least comic value in the over-the-top stunts and c-movie acting .  this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face .  it was like a less-funny spy version of the big hit  ( i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd )  with even-worse acting .  we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena ,  and not jim ,  after all of the hugging and high-fives .  a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier . 
a fondly-remembered melodrama  thanks chiefly to ronald colman's fine oscar-winning central performance  about an oft-treated theme :  the nature of acting and how it can overtake one's perception of reality .  in this case ,  we have a well-known thespian tackling shakespeare's  " othello "  ,  so that the film's last third delves effectively into the thriller genre  with press agent edmond o'brien  ( who happens to really be besotted with colman's co-star and ex-wife signe hasso )  'investigating' the actor's possible involvement in the desdemona-like strangling of a celebrity-seeking waitress  ( a very slim shelley winters )  .  the theatrical/new york atmosphere of the immediate post-war era is vividly captured by the husband-and-wife screen writing team of garson kanin and ruth gordon and legendary  " actor's director "  george cukor  ( all of whom were recognized by the academy with nominations )  ;  incidentally ,  the film nabbed a second oscar for miklos rozsa's eclectic score .  colman ,  forever the suave leading man blessed besides with a velvety voice ,  does well enough by shakespeare  gaining conviction the farther his character slips into obsessive jealousy ,  a murderous rage and ,  eventually ,  paranoia ;  however ,  he is not let down by a supporting cast which also includes director ray collins ,  reporter millard mitchell ,  detective joe sawyer and coroner whit bissell .  though the mid-section is a bit strained ,  the film makes up for any deficiencies with a remarkably-handled expressionist denouement . 
fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by david f .  friedman .  the lead actress stacey walker is well-cast and strangely attractive .  she resembles a deranged renee zellweger with a bad hair-do .  this chick only made two of these films and then moved back to texas .  the music is terrible .  one of her boyfriends is played by sam melville  ( from the tv show the rookies )  using a different name .   best line in the film from tony -  " are you putting me on ,  doll ?  none of my chicks put me on "  .  good b/w cinematography from laslo kovacs  ( easy rider & targets & many others )  .  good locales  ( cool swimming pool ,  also used in the defilers )  .  strange ending but fitting .  a 4 out of 10 .  best performance stacey walker . 
in an interview ,  david duchovny said he hasn't been able to watch even the first hour of this film - and neither should you .  the scene where he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed if he can look around - change the name he gives and he could had lifted his performance from just about any episode of the x-files .  he's on autopilot for the whole film .  brad pitt overacts appallingly . 
this was yet another big screen outing for a us tv show from the sixties it is amusing enough but was very much to formula .  intelligent martian lands on earth and meets the not too bright humans ,  in his view .   the usual wackiness ensues with the human ,  bridges ,  eventually bonds with him and helps him to get home .  along the way he also gets the girl ,  hannah .   this is a nice outing for some pleasant hollywood stars who i had not seen for a while .   pleasant enough to pass some spare time if you have not got anything better to view . 
i would of given this film a zero out of ten ,  but i will give it a two .  reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film ,  which is not really a reason .  last point is that rani appears in this film and does a smooch with kamal .  i love rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress .  which is why i didn't enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal ,  but its no big deal .  anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable ,  lets actually talk about this film .  is it good or bad ,  i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn .  me being a fantastic critic ,  you can see my other 250+ review's by clicking on my name ,  i have great taste .  the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema ,  why is there no morale in this movie .  its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks .  watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick ,  man cant kiss properly anyway . 
cheap ,  mediocre sequel to the successful  " the mummy's hand "  has presumably dead evil professor andoheb ( george zucco ) preparing his predecessor mehemet bey ( turhan bey ) for the quest of revenge overseas to america using mummy kharis ( lon chaney ,  jr who has no reason being in the disguise .  . any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims ) in the goal of killing the surviving members of the banning family whose patriarch stephen ( dick foran ) and assistant babe hanson ( wallace ford ) retrieved the mummified corpse of princess ananka from her tomb in egypt .  . andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient egyptian custom .  bey and the mummy kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the high priest of karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise .  every full moon ,  bey will feed kharis a form of liquid derived of several tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his master's wishes .  bey commands kharis to kill stephen and his sister jane ( mary gordon )  ,  while also biding time for babe to return so that he will become victim # 3 .  dr .  john banning ( john hubbard ) plans to wed isobel ( elyse knox )  ,  but doesn't know that bey secretly covets his fiancé making plans to kidnap her with kharis' help .  john's life is in danger because of his father .  . he's also the last remaining member of the banning line .  if bey has isobel ,  there's no chance of any more bannings being born .  the police must find kharis and the one responsible for his carnage .  . bey .   this film is a continuation from hand set years later as members of that film ,  foran ,  ford & zucco all appear in  " aging "  make-up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the bannings .  the cornball romance of john and isobel seems merely in this plot so that bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up .  and ,  bey merely sees her frolicking with john on the grass .  . the whole  " love-at-first-sight "  rubbish really didn't wash for me .  plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm .  . is any mummy really that powerful ?  this film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it .  there really isn't that much story here and yes ,  typical of universal monster pictures ,  even in america a mob of people will light .  . ho hum .  . torches going after kharis .  you know how it'll end .  . john and the super-powerful kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame . 
in addition to his  " tarzan "  series ,  the prolific edgar rice burroughs did write many other books ,  although ,  aside from the popular  " at the earth's core "  ,  few of these have been filmed .  one exception is the novel entitled  " the lad and the lion "  ,  brought to the screen as  " the lion man "   ( 1936 )  ,  an over-talkative ,  static ,  old-hat ,  slow-moving and rather dull movie ,  despite being filmed on real desert locations .  actually  " movie "  is the wrong word .  the narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks .  for instance ,  at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear .  even more frustrating for the keen movie fan ,  are the characters who make an impression of sorts  ( like the lass who plies hall with drugged wine )  but are enacted by players who are not credited !  the credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns .  one exception is australian actress finis barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young master fairy .  admittedly ,  most of the cast are saddled with atrocious king james dialogue which has to be heard to be believed !  but the way to play this rubbish is tongue-in-cheek ,  a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's roster of no-talent players .  maybe director j . p .  mccarthy scotched that idea .  anyway ,  it's sad to see the lovely kathleen burke forced to trade lines with the likes of richard carlyle  ( her dad )  and jon hall  ( her suitor )  .  admittedly ,  mr hall delivers his lines with marginally more conviction than mr carlyle ,  but that is no recommendation . 
george p .  cosmatos'  " rambo :  first blood part ii "  is pure wish-fulfillment .  the united states clearly didn't win the war in vietnam .  they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers .  the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation ,  who made this war happen .  the character of rambo is perfect to notice this .  he is extremely patriotic ,  bemoans that us-americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier ,  but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians .  like every film that defends the war  ( e . g .   " we were soldiers "  )  also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia .  and for that matter also the reason for every single us-american soldier that was there .  instead ,  rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation .  it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories ,  rather than suppressing them .   " do we get to win this time ?  "  yes ,  you do . 
flight of fury starts as general tom barnes  ( angus macinnes )  organises an unofficial test flight of the x-77 ,  a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible .  general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher  ( steve toussaint )  the job & everything goes well until the x-77 disappears ,  even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone  ( vincenzo nicoli )  who plans to use the x-77 to fly into us airspace undetected & drop some bombs which will kills lots of people .  general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane & sends in one man army john sands  ( co-writer & executive producer steven seagal )  to get it back & kill all the bad guy's in the process .  .  .   this american ,  british & romanian co-production was directed by michael keusch & was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man  ( 2006 )  & attack force  ( 2007 )  ,  luckily someone decided the partnership wasn't working & an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration's between the two .  apparently flight of fury is an almost scene-for-scene word-for-word remake of black thunder  ( 1988 )  starring michael dudikoff with many of the same character's even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder & therefore cannot compare the two .  flight of fury is a terrible film ,  the poorly made & written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days .  it's boring even though it's not that slow ,  the character's are poor ,  it's full of clichés ,  things happen at random ,  the plot is poor ,  the reasoning behind events are none existent & it's a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed .  the action scenes are lame & there's no real excitement in it ,  the villains are boring as are the heroes & it's right down there with the worst seagal has made .   flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn't even matched up that well ,  the background can change ,  peoples clothes change ,  the area changes ,  the sky & the quality of film changes very abruptly as it's all too obvious we are watching clips from other  ( better )  films spliced in .  hell ,  seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this .  the action scenes consist of shoot-outs so badly edited it's hard to tell who is who & of course seagal breaking peoples arms .  the whole production feels very cheap & shoddy .   the imdb reckons this had a budget of about $12 , 000 , 000 which i think is total rubbish ,  i mean if so where did all the money go ?  although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods ,  it was actually shot in romania & the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan .  the acting is terrible as one would expect & seagal looks dubbed again .   flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring ,  amateurish & is an almost scene-for-scene remake of another film anyway .  another really lazy & poorly produced action thriller from seagal ,  why do i even bother any more ? 
a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a  " children's film "  ,  and that it certainly is ,  though it is one made for adults .  takashi miike uses the fantasy genre ,  particularly ,  the children's fantasy genre ,  as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war .   the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the  " hero "  in this years annual festival ,  only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined .  what follows is a hallucinatory ,  grotesque ,  whimsical ,  and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore ,  but wait there's also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world .  however ,  the villain here ,  is not a mere demon ,  it is the demon-spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans  " use "  and  " discard "  .  usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate/resentment ,  the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals ( those whove played the video game ,  sonic the hedghog ,  might remember a certain dr .  robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who sonic had to then  " liberate "  )  .   the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character ,  essentially playing the straight man ,  in a world gone suddenly mad .  though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers ,  as do many of the yokia themselves ,  who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots ,  some spirits being umbrellas with eyes ,  talking walls ,  or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans .  .  . of course in this magical world of miike's yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them .   in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children's fantasy ,  as few ,  if any ,  of the characters are heroic ,  their victory being a combination of happenstance ,  almost arbitrary faith ,  and a desire to party .  the yokai spirits ,  only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout ,  after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival ,  and even then only to dance and party .  also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all's well that ends well fantasy ending ,  but with a final scene ,  showing our hero years older ,  with an adult job ,  now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth ,  who then despondently turn to the villain ,  who being a spirit can never really die .  this ending ,  with it's yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon's pikachu ,  warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves ,  but of the horrors of over-consumption .  the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them ( in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit )  ,  and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence ,  they become soulless vengeful machines ,  not unlike those seen in modern video games ,  suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die ,  but can become deformed .   this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to ,  and i believe it shows ,  as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness .  though i've focused mostly on the story  ( since lots of users here seem to write it off )  ,  i do want to say that visually it's a kaleidescope of cgi ,  stop animation ,  costume ,  and live puppetry ,  that works remarkably well .  there's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film ,  and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted ,  as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons ,  though this film is sharper and more adult than either .  the yokai are beaten ,  brutalized ,  and turned into machines of living hate ,  who i believe even kill a few humans ,  a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening ,  while a sexual undercurrent ,  the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero ,  or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy ,  seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes ,  especially when considering this is a  " children's film "  .  however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough ,  not to traumatize any children to bad .  grims fairy tales ,  before revisions ,  did much worse ,  far more often .   all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet ,  with enough visual drama and great performances ( the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them ,  thats laugh out loud funny at times )  to appeal to audiences of all ages ,  and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth .  the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them ,  but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood .  another beautiful ,  funny ,  and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex .  instant classic . 
this has to be ,  hands down ,  hats off ,  one of the most uproarious comedies ever made .  starting with the animated blowing ,  popping bubbles ,  the entrance to the daytime awards ,  the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet ,  the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech ,  the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer ,  under phony smiles .  now that is only in the first few minutes .  then ,  all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous .  ridiculous in a good way ,  no ,  make that a great way .  this was the first time i'd seen the always charming teri hatcher .  while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives ,  she herself is always watchable - same goes for lois & clark .  not a huge follower ,  but if i run across an episode i'd watch it .  robert downey ,  jr .  ,  does a great turn as slimy ,  smarmy ,  snaky ,  sycophantic david seaton barnes ,  the producer who'd give his right eye to see sally field's celeste talbert leave the show ,  if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriarty's montana moorehead .   moriarty absolutely shines in this movie ,  just as she had everywhere else she's appeared .  here ,  all she has to do is scream  " i hate you i hate you you creep !  "  or give one of her anti-celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin ,  and she has me rolling in the aisles .  yes ,  cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress ,  and one hell of a comedienne .  sally field gratefully departs from the usual 70-mm-sized lifetime tragedy of the week movies ,  and we're all reminded why she is who she is today ,  having started off in comedy afraid of nothing .  her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor ,  but like a caterpillar in a cocoon ,  the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was .  the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy ,  serious roles ,  that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen .   how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher ,  if only for a glorified cameo .  she doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen .  she takes a role which ,  in the hands of a lesser actress ,  could easily have been forgotten ,  but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself .   how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this !  at the time ,  she wasn't really known for much .  adventures in babysitting was kind of cute  ( yes ,  i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price )  ,  but she didn't hold my attention - - much .  but here ,  she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who ,  of course ,  turns out to be the niece's father ,  and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother .   i'll stop there - i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy ,  or at least a novela .  if you've seen it ,  then reminisce .  if you haven't ,  you've missed a real classic ,  but not really .  the dvd's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years ,  and this movie is timeless ,  so what the hell . 
ok ,  as everyone has pointed out ,  this film is a complete dog .  to some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised  ( or darkened down to near invisibility )  to escape the censor's x-rating ;  but the film has many other flaws as well .   to begin with ,  the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up .  the baddies in this film are furry and don't like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires .  now you just can't do that with a crappy genre flick ,  you've got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing .  in fact the whole  ( confusing and poorly presented )  plot is something that has already been done for vampires ,  but doesn't make any sense in a werewolf movie .   secondly ,  the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen .  anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically ,  yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy .   there are a couple of slightly good bits .  i actually quite liked the score .  others have mentioned sybil danning's tits .  and .  .  .    ( ***spoiler*** ,  if such a thing can exist )   i also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves' stronghold .  there are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly ,  but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters .  i mean ,  you can kill werewolves with silver bullets ,  and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days .  shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together ,  hmm ?  but in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti-lycanthrope weapons . 
this is the kind of movie hollywood needs to make more of .  no extravagant props ,  no car chases ,  no clever one-liners .  just people dealing with being people .   william macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father ,  donald sutherland .  macy is the dutiful son ,  sutherland is the domineering father .  son wants out of the business ,  father won't let him .  macy loves his own son ,  played beautifully by david dorfman  (  " the ring "  )  .  he also starts to fall in love with neve campbell ,  a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office .   it's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family .  there are many touching scenes ,  especially between macy and his little boy .  and as you'd expect in a film with william macy in it ,  there's a bit of humor too .   excellent job all around ,  actors and director .  nice to know they can still make a good film in hollywood on a small budget . 
posh spice victoria beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to la for work purposes  ( footballer hubby david is now a galaxy la player after his transfer from real madrid )  was originally going to be a full series , but was thankfully abridged to just one hour or so . but even in this form , it is still numbingly interminable .   like virtually all 'reality' tv shows , most of the incident comes across as blatantly faked , with the programme itself even admitting that posh's newly appointed personal assistant is an actress . an ugly-betty lookalike , we hear some lamely written and performed banter early on ( with an obvious joke about becks' apparent dalliance with a previous , and rather more glamorous pa rebecca loos , though her name is not mentioned )  with further sequences involving a fake blow-up doll to trick the paparazzi and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball .   this could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff , and had an actress or impersonator in the lead role . talented impressionist ronni ancona would've been perfect and is better at being posh than posh herself is , and if this more sensible decision had been taken , much more fun and amusement would've ensued . sadly , we are left with the real thing here  ( ms ancona may have rejected the script as too weak anyway )  , and although there are odd scattered attempts at self-deprecation and irony , it never remotely works because of prior info of la beckham's considerable wealth beforehand , and her non-ability at delivering would-be jokes ; despite the intentions to send up her image , mrs beckham comes across as a shallow egotist , and her weak one-liners don't persuade us she has any humorous self-awareness . i suspect that if a more realistic fly-on-the-wall documentary approach had been taken , namely posh walking down any street in la and being totally ignored  ( instead of the frantic , staged scenes of mild hysteria on show here )  ,  and associates making unscripted jibes about the previously mentioned ms loos , this would've made marginally better tv , but being sycophantic pr material , the bony one herself would never allow such events to happen .   having said that , the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was indifferently presented in front of an uninterested crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in hollywood . her colleague scary spice  ( aka mel brown )  also found it impossible to make it big residing in the movie capital despite her affair  ( which was not consummated )  with big name eddie murphy .   the spice girls were of course a massively successful bubblegum pop group in the mid 1990's , more so in their native britain but still popular briefly in other countries , including the us . they were certainly good fun at their peak of glory  ( 1997 )  when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the uk with cool britannia and a new labour government which the spice girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time , even if it was somewhat manufactured . but they were never outstanding musical or singing talents , and uk optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year  ( the starting point was arguably the tragic death of princess diana )  , as did the spices' themselves . their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious , and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye permanently with dignity to enjoy their fortunes ,  then we would have all had pleasant memories encrypted on our mind without any guilt . unfortunately , the emergence of the hideous 'celebrity' culture in the uk towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those imaginings , and we have all suffered thousands , if not millions of stories about the spices since , posh being the worst offender , with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind . it was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon , which is baffling as they have never gone away and they certainly don't require any additions to their swelling bank accounts . maybe it's because two of them are struggling single mothers , perhaps ?   good , it's soon time for becks' adventures on a revelatory documentary next , i can hardly wait .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   rating : 2 out of 10 . 
when american author edgar allan poe visits london ,  he is approached by british journalist alan foster ,  who becomes the target of a peculiar wager .  not believing poe's assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience ,  foster accepts a bet from poe and his friend sir thomas blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the blackwood's haunted castle .  once installed in the abandoned castle ,  foster discovers that he is not alone ,  as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men ,  and a doctor of metaphysics - who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths !  the first time i watched this glorious bit of classic horror ,  i was mesmerized the entire time .  i found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful .  babs steele is undeniably beautiful .  the music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing .  the topless scene threw me for a loop ,  as i was not expecting it .  it looks as synapse did a great job with picture enhancement ,  because this movie looks damn fine for its age ,  and it's the uncut international version ,  to boot .  this is the movie responsible for me starting a babs steele and klaus kinski collection . 
i could never remember the name of this show .  i use to watch it when i was 8 .  i remember staying up late when i wasn't suppose to just so i could watch this show .  it was the best show to me .  from what i remember of it ,  it is still great .  this showed starred lucas black making him the first boy i ever had a crush on .  i am from the country ,  therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me ,  but for him i would definitely make an exception .  which after seeing crazy in alabama ,  friday night lights ,  and tokyo drift you should see why .  he is a great actor and has been since he was a kid .  i miss this show and wish it would come back out .  if anyone ever sees where they are selling the season please email me .  kywildflower16@hotmail . com
peter weir's first international success ,  the last wave is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth .  richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries .  david gulpilil plays one of the suspects ,  who does his best to guide chamberlin thru the realm of 'dreamtime' ,  an alternate reality/timeline central to native australian history and tribal custom .  heavy on atmosphere ,  deliberately ambiguous in plotting ,  the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects ,  probably due to budgetary limitations .  nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you . 
i have always enjoyed the pokemon movies .  yes ,  i know ,  all of them are very corny ,  mediocre in some certain areas and sure ,  even though they're aimed at little kids they're too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement ,  " hey ,  lighten up ,  it's a kids movie ,  "  but all that aside ,  aren't they still good pieces of entertainment ?  in my opinion ,  they are so and i enjoy them greatly .  this one is just as enjoyable as the previous three ,  and certainly cuter .  it has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable ,  fresh pokemon celebi .  it's not the best pokemon movie ,  but i do enjoy it more than the third installment ,  even though the third is not bad ,  and the entire series is just entertaining ,  harmless ,  popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more ,  nothing less .  this film has some high marks of intensity and interest ,  especially around the climax/ending ,  as do all the installments ,  and the characters ,  while a bit more lackluster than the previous three ,  i thought ,  are still likable and humorous .  this films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length adaptions ,  and it doesn't deserve that . 
this movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown america for a young girl on her own .  the realism and subtle nuances ,  offered to ashley judd's character ,  ruby ,  by the storyline ,  capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of florida .  from the slam of a screen door ,  to the lack of work ,  the echoes of what life is really like on the  " red-neck riviera "  provide rough choices for the young girl .  paradise did not come easy .  but she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit ,  and learns to be her own woman ,  with a strength that flows from within .  ashley judd's winning smile ,  and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration .  the careful pace of the character development resembles that of  " ulee's gold "  in 1997 ,  starring peter fonda ,  and also directed by victor nunez . 
every once in a while  ,  someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks  " what's with snitch'd "   ?  i know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror .  you see ,  i was the cinematographer on the film .   let me clarify some points regarding this  " interesting life experience "  .   originally ,  snitch'd was called one hard hit .  i met james cahill in july of 1999 ,  a day after i wrapped triangle square ,  a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades .  .  . it fell eternal victim to the fine print of sag's notorious experimental feature contract .  but i digress .  .  .   i though i was on a roll ,  and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $25 , 000 ,  not wanting to break pace ,  i took it .  after all ,  clerks ,  el mariachi .  .  .  i too believed the myth back then .   let's just chalk it up as  " film school "  for many involved ,  myself included .  snitch'd was shot over two weeks in august ,  1999 ,  in aliso viejo and santa ana ,  ca .  cahill taught drama at a high school in the latter city  (  yes ,  he is a drama and english teacher .  .  . consider that while watching the film ,  or even observing the use of apostrophe in title  )  ,  hence the locations and cast .   of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l . a . 's channel 2 morning news weather girl vera jimenez ,  and of greater impact ,  the debut of eva longoria ,  who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt .  i must say her professional dedication ,  focus and  " let's do this "  attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come .    snitch'd suffered from poor optics ,  few lights or electricity ,  several boom operators du jour ,  and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication .  none of that overshadows the actual content ,  which speaks for itself .   anyway ,  by 2003 ,  the film was sold to distributors  (  at a net loss ,  i understand  )  who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box  (  by then she was a rising ,  working name  )  but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to snitch'd .  since cahill's other passion is antiquarian book dealing ,  it appears to confirm he believes you can ,  in fact ,  judge a book by it's cover .  .  .  as so many have picked up this dvd based on it's sleeve .  ----------------- one year later ,  eva ,  now on a soap ,  and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted ,  split second ,  which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent .    6 years later ,  i was hired to shoot another cahill film titled juarez ,  mexico .  i though he had worked out the process ;  my participation was contingent on casting ,  script and crew control ,  and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies ,  for what it was .  .  .  a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in juarez ;  despite claims here and elsewhere ,  the film has never appeared in any festival or venue ,  although cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject ,  virgin of juarez and border town . 
if you've read the original novel ,  as i did ,  you will probably hate this thing .   the film version of _absolute beginners_ is a nightmarish conglomerate of 1980s anachronisms attempting to create a  " period piece "  set in the late 1950s and failing to re-create or even pay homage to that period -- the us monstrosity of _dirty dancing_ does similar to 1963 ,  except that film proved financially successful despite having equally amateurish screen writing .  in addition to suffering from  " looking too 1980s "  ,  the characters have been changed ,  re-arranged ,  and downplayed to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and ,  of course ,  their names :  suze is transformed from the narrator's flighty ex-girlfriend and promiscuous negrophile who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money  ( at her own admittance in the first few pages )  into a hapless and naive  " eve " -archetype seduced by fame and glamour ,  exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss ,  who surprisingly wasn't given a van dyke and pointy hairstyle .  she and the narrator ,  re-named  " colin "   ( after the book's author ,  colin macinnes )  for the film ,  are also in a relationship .   big jill's character ,  a lesbian seemingly butch yet  " fop like "  in her mid-20s who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubble-headed lesbians ,  and one of the narrator's closest friends ,  dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator ,  is reduced to a sort of  " named extra "  with only a few throw-away lines ,  and tonnes of comical outfits .   the fabulous hoplite ,  a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel ,  is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film ,  camped-up and all but ignored .   the narrator's father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film ,  he's played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood ,  and the disarray of his marriage to the narrator's mum seems ,  for all practical purposes ,  ignored .   in its favour ,  the music  ( for what it is )  is well-composed ,  and you have to give the production and writing crews credit for actually taking a line from the book  (  "  .  .  . some days ,  they'll write musicals about the 1950s .  .  .  "  )  as their inspiration to write a musical ,  but in the world of bad camped-up musicals ,  this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch .  unlike _shock treatment_ or _starstruck_ crucial plot elements are treated as afterthoughts .  unlike _the apple_ ,  there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue .   you really can't blame it's  " too 1980s "  feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s .  the film version of _annie_ released in 1981 ,  pays a wonderfully well-executed tribute to the look and feel of new york city in the 1930s ,  and _napolean dynamite_ manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003  ( though it's not explicitly set in the 1980s ,  those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film  " feels very 1980s "  )  .  obviously ,  it was _possible_ to make something good out of this ,  especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the uk ,  but it fails most apparently in the look and feel ,  and also in its treatment of the source material ,  which is downright disrespectful .   perhaps if you haven't read and have no intentions of reading the novel ,  you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late-1950s soho london's modernist jazz set .  i can definitely see what the writing team were attempting ,  but they definitely could have done better .  with boy george as a household name and mixed-race musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 uk ,  they definitely did _not_ need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing .  in fact ,  i'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly -- it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teen-aged audience like two-bit idiots to make a quick buck off of . 
easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays ,  it has been seriously let down here .  shoddy direction ,  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy .   in the town of verona ,  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  ( patrick rycart )  ,  a montague ,  falls in love with juliet  ( rebecca saire )  ,  a capulet .  bloodshed soon erupts .  .  .   the studio work ,  especially in daytime scenes ,  seriously stagnates the energy of the play .  it's a story that ,  with it's energy ,  deserves to be shot outdoors .  coupled with this the costumes are hideous ,  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces .  the stage fighting looks horrendous ,  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging .   patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo .  he manages the character's intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland ,  often inexpressive eyes limit his range .  it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo .  rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet - she captures the character's naiveté but a little more sassiness would have been welcome .   the supporting roles don't fare much better .  joseph o'connor's friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut .  anthony andrews' mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera .  he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result .  alan rickman ,  underplaying his role ,  has virtually no presence as tybalt .  he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years ,  but that isn't in evidence here .  the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera .  only micheal hordern ,  in probably his best role in this series ,  comes out of this with any dignity .  his capulet is well-played and a joy to watch .   see one of the other versions of this story instead . 
kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets .  with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents .  infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole .  it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer ,  but the comedy is scatter shot ,  its focus wanders more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso .  i kept asking  " what am i watching "  .  i watched it from start to finish and i still don't know what the hell happened .  its a shame since there are some great action scenes ,  some amusing jokes and the occasional moment ,  but nothing ,  none of it ever comes together ,  i'd take a pass . 
i am an actor , producer ,  director and what i am about to say are facts .  this project was the worst film in movie making history .  from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke .  why would blockbuster released such crap ?  i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession .  was the director trying to make a bad movie ?  i don't think so .  i seen bad zombie movies ,  but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table .  this movie sucks !  !  !  i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself ,  but please consider in taking up a different profession .  i respect the fact that you completed a movie ,  but i have to ask you  "  were you smoking crack  "  ,  i mean the makeup on your girls ,  the scary zombies ,  what were you thinking .  to the whole nation ,  if i could have voted zero i would have .  worst film in movie making history !  !  ! 
**spoilers**this was an ugly movie ,  and i'm sorry that i watched it .  like jan kounen's dobermann ,  it suffers mostly from poor editing--or lack of it .  it is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention ,  he added all of the footage he had shot together .  there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie .  one of them is *spoiler* when benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him .  that was cool--but okay ,  we got it !  move on please !  the camera won't stop spinning around this guy !  there's maybe one or two more cool scenes that i forgot about in this flood of mediocrity ,  but the last duel scene is not one of them !  it may be because unlike in the earlier sword-handling scenes ,  shanao isn't masked--but just because the director couldn't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled asano tadanobu doesn't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80% of the sword fight with extreme close-ups of sword clashes !  and all from the same angle ,  may i add .  the director should learn from the american produced 1995 bullet-train ninja movie the hunted !  i personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years .  the situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the japanese media ,  due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority .  the movie versions of gto and salary man kintaro are two other recent examples *end spoiler* i don't understand .  i just don't understand why people who don't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this .  maybe the worst was lost in the translation .   the ending of the movie--on which marketing played a lot ,  is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between shanao and benkei .  but that legend is not the most popular in japanese folklore ,  and it is so detached from contemporary themes ,  that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques ,  who cares how the director wants to re-interpret the story !  ?  director sasaki hirohisa of crazy lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new japanese directors to ignore japanese audiences ,  and target their movies for foreign film festivals--in order to gain faster international fame .  this works ,  although it doesn't make sense ,  because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries-what kind of movies people watch in those countries .  certainly not gojoe and the like . 
damn ,  i've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still don't get bored watching it .   the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me .   the cgis are quite bad imho ,  but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just .  .  .  just a genius perfect combination for such a movie .  the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable ,  the plot is so good .   however although ,  the movie had little flaws ,  like e . g .  sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too  " slow "  ,  but i don't mean the scenic parts by that ,  i totally loved those .   also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story ,  like when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps ,  where all their data is saved ,  and has this conversation with the guy down there .  .  .  but that may also just be me  : d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized ,  they should have made the getting-back-true-memory-part a bit longer and  " louder "  but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again .  .  . 
cute idea .  .  .  salesgirl linda smith  ( yolande donlan )  inherits a teeny tiny little county of lampidorra .  that country ,  which wasn't even in north america ,  was made the 49th state .  .  .   ( of course ,  there were only 48 states at the time ,  since this was made in 1952 .  .  .  )  linda travels to the country she has inherited ,  and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people .  at one point ,  she sings a song that she claims is from her people the navajo ,  and it gets ever-more sillier from there .  .  .  .  although yolande donlan's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared .  there are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess .  filmed in a glorious british version of technicolor ,  or some such equivalent ,  about the only big name here is dirk bogarde as british subject tony craig ,  cheese vendor .  bogarde made a big splash in the uk film industry after serving in the war ,  and was even knighted by qe ii .  craig and  " the new princess "  keep bumping into each other ,  and their adventures become more intertwined as lampidorra's financial problems worsen .  .  .  fun little farce .  .  .  . along the lines of marx brothers film .  also note that donlan later married val guest ,  the writer and director of our little project ,  and stayed married for 50 years !  guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks ,  in both the uk & the us . 
this is one of the worse movies that i have ever seen in my entire life .  i wish i could travel back in time and do the following :   1 )  find out where the  " movie "   " war games- the dead code "  was filmed 2 )  watch the original war games with my current computer knowledge and the eyes of a 1983 preteen .  3 )  break into the pentagon computer in the 80's with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered .  4 )  reprogram the whopper to nuke the location of the dead code minutes prior to its first day of filming 5 )  come back to the present ,  have a beer and get will smith and tommy lee jones to  " flash "  my memory blank of the whole event ,  especially my original viewing of  " the dead code "  6 )  have another beer and watch wars games 7 )  be happy until the next bad remake of a good 80's movie .   8 )  did i forget the have jar jar killed .  i am not sure if i would have to travel into the future for that .  maybe i need access to a wormhole . 
after all these years ,  of peter o'tool's brilliant ,  costly giving of his soul ,  film after film ,  at last ,  hollywood tosses him an oscar recently .   country dance showed up one night late ,  and of course ,  blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged  " life "  .  how does he do it ?   york again also is brilliant in this kind of play .  both psychological battleships loaded for bear .  .  .  .   bravo to author ,  director ,  cast ,  and camera crew .  no wonder the nazi's lost to these irish ,  scot ,  english blends .  .  .  . brutal honesty hurts .  .  . back in the 70's ,  when i personally believed  " honesty "  was pure and absolutely vital to trust .  i have modified my edgy extremes ,  and will settle for more human ,  warm flaws within myself and others .   forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear ,  and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes .  .  .  . 
and i mean ultra light .  this film features four giant stars ,  about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that .   there really isn't too much to say about this stinker ,  other than that although it has a couple of really good bits ,  most of it isn't very funny .  nor does it work at all as a romance .  how about as a romantic comedy ?  not on your life .  most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated ,  much less amusing .   what's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all .  this movie could have been so much more ,  especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted ,  complete with phony quotes from critics .  the film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews .  but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes ,  it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance .   the same with catherine zeta-jones' character -- the whinny ,  self centered movie star .  zeta-jones does a good job with what she's given ,  but she's given practically nothing .  it's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years .   in the end ,  it is hard to understand what made zeta-jones ,  julia roberts ,  john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship ,  which sinks like a rerun of  " the love boat .  "  in fact ,  as the old joke goes ,  they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal .  it would probably make a better story .  so ,  go ahead and tell us ,  filmmakers ,  what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this ? 
connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times .   that's it ,  folks .  the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not .   these 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness  ( flared trousers ,  big hair ,  zapata moustaches etc .  )  .  this one isn't .   the script is bad ,  the acting is bad ,  the direction is bad ,  and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad .   the title ,  hinting at a sex comedy ,  is grossly misleading .   i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague . 
i've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production .  while a comedy/oldies radio dj in 1988 ,  i got a call from the production company .  they asked if i'd write and record a bit they'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a tv  ( the television screen itself would never be shown )  .  i said sure ,  wrote a parody of '50s sci-fi monster clichés ,  rounded up some sound effects and called in another dj ,  pam landry ,  to play the female part .  as she happened to be on the air at the time ,  she put on a long song ,  joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take .  giggling ,  she then went back to her show while i mixed in the goofy sound effects .  we'd have never done it if we'd known that  " woodchipper massacre "  was going to be such a turkey -- but ,  then again ,  we never got paid for our efforts ,  either !  -- gary theroux
i must admit a slight disappointment with this film ;  i had read a lot about how spectacular it was ,  yet the actual futuristic sequences ,  the age of science ,  take up a very small amount of the film .  the sets and are excellent when we get to them ,  and there are some startling images ,  but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards .  .  .   much the best drama of the piece is in the mid-section ,  and then it plays as melodrama ,  arising from the 'high concept' science-fiction nature of it all ,  and insufficiently robust dialogue .  there is far more human life in this part though ,  with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator ,  the  " boss "  of the everytown .  i loved richardson's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines ,  dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey's aloof ,  confident visitor .  this boss is a posturing ,  convincingly deluded figure ,  unable to realise the small-fry nature of his kingdom .  .  .  it's not a great role ,  yet richardson makes a lot of it .   everytown itself is presumably meant to be england ,  or at least an english town fairly representative of england .  interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things ;  the 'things to come' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal ,  but to just go on and on .  there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section ,  concerning more personal 'life' ,  yet one is left quite unsatisfied .  the film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities ;  it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle ,  blunt moralism ,  every time .  and ,  of course ,  recall the hedged-bet finale :  raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are !    concerning the question of the film being a prediction :  i must say it's not at all bad as such ,  considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right .  the grander conceptions have something to them ;  a war in 1940 ,  well that was perhaps predictable .  .  .  lasting nearly 30 years ,  mind !  ?  a nuclear bomb - the  " super gun "  or some such contraption - in 2036 .  .  .  a technocratic socialist  " we don't believe in independent nation states " -type government ,  in britain ,  after 1970 .  .  .  hmmm ,  sadly nowhere near on that one ,  chaps !   ; - )  no real politics are gone into here which is a shame ;  all that surfaces is a very laudable anti-war sentiment .  generally ,  it is assumed that dictatorship - whether boneheaded-luddite-fascist ,  as under the boss ,  or all-hands-to-the-pump scientific socialism - will *be the deal* ,  and these implications are not broached .  .  .  while we must remember that in 1936 ,  there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out - or even how they were turning out - the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers' vision on other matters .   much of the earlier stuff should - and could - have been cut in my opinion ;  only the briefest stuff from '1940' would have been necessary ,  yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous ,  and it is ages before we get to the richardson-massey parts .  i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott ;  who is just a trifle sceptical ,  cutting a flashing-eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose .  the character is not explored ,  or frankly explained or exploited ,  except for one scene which i shall not spoil ,  and her relationship with the boss isn't explored ;  but then this was the 1930s ,  and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then .  edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles ;  more so in the first as a hapless chap ,  praying for war ,  only to be bluntly put down by another massey character .  massey himself helps things a lot ,  playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto ,  contrasting well with a largely diffident cast ,  save for richardson ,  and scott and chapman ,  slightly .   i would say that  " things to come "  is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936 ;  one of the few serious british science fiction films to date ,  indeed !  its set  ( piece )  design and harnessing of resources are ravenous ,  marvellous .    yet ,  the script is ultimately over-earnest and ,  at times ,  all over the place .  the direction is prone to a flatness ,  though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion .  the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however ;  respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology ,  and an engaging ,  jerky performance that consistently beguiles .  such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing ;  powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this - they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers ,  great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate .    " things to come "  ,  as it stands ,  is an intriguing oddity ,  well worth perusing ,  yet far short of a  " metropolis "  .  .  .  'tis much as  " silly "  ,  in wells' words ,  as that lang film ,  yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it . 
yes ,  some plots are a bit hard to follow ,  and the bill does have a tendency to get violent ,  but it is actually an engrossing show ,  that i try not to miss .  a vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense ,  and the acting is fairly good ,  though i do miss roberta taylor as inspector gina gold and todd carty as gabriel kent .  i will admit ,  i prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes ,  and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed ,  as i found it easier to watch when it was at 8 . 00 .  still ,  why i like the bill is because not only it is engrossing ,  but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable .  it is true though ,  that it is more melodramatic than it was ,  but i really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously .  8/10 bethany cox
in the 60's ,  having as the background the rehearsal and recording of  " sympathy for the devil "  in the classic album  " beggar's banquet "  by the revolutionary bad boy rolling stones  mick jagger ,  keith richards ,  charlie watts ,  bill wyman and brian jones  plus marianne faithful ,  godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements  the black power through the black panthers ,  the feminism ,  the communism ,  the fascism - entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapters :   " the stones rolling ;   " outside black novel "  ;   " sight and sound "  ;   " all about eve "  ;   " the heart of occident "  ;   " inside black syntax "  ;  and ,   " under the stones the beach "  .    " sympathy for the devil "  is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director jean-luc godard .  the narrative and the footages are awful ,  but fortunately i love the stones and  " sympathy for the devil "  and it is nice to see them in the beginning of their careers ;  otherwise this documentary would be unbearable .  my vote is three .   title  ( brazil )  :   " sympathy for the devil " 
this movie is bizarre .  better put ,  it's  " freakin' weird "  .  i could give you a plot summary ,  or some hoity toity analysis ,  but i would consider it a waste of your time .  all anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters ,  one incestuous relationship ,  homicide ,  post mortem mutilation ,  and one really disturbing infatuation .  at the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself ,  but not in a good way like after  " pulp fiction "  or  " fight club "  .  it's like you're a teenager  ( or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager ) and have just done something you a :  wish you hadn't done ,  and b :  hope to the good lord of heaven and earth that your parents never find out about .  and nobody likes that .  my advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth ,  just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch  " kazaam "  ( yes ,  i would rather watch  " kazaam "  than  " murderous maids "  ,  read into it what you want )  . 
this movie was horrible .   they didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly .  it was a definite sleeper .  you'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but d-wars surprises you with even a let down in that department .    also ,  the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick .  and i seriously mean that .   i was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad !  !  !  please ,  whatever you do people ,  don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d-wars . 
it's a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr .  the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome !  the guy is cute too so it's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls . 
i try to be very objective when i view a low budget movie .  i also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions .  i expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios .  therefore i apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases .  but this movie was just a dud .  period .  the premise was terrible .  the main character ,  mary gordano  ( alicia silverstone )  ,  was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes .  there was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world .  also ,  to make this movie more mysterious ,  the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood ,  especially in the warehouse .   once again another disappointing movie that i could only give three points to . 
i am totally addicted to this show .  i can't wait till the week goes by to see the next showing .  it's a great story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show .  i will tune in every week to watch it even if i am not home i always have my vcr set to tape monarch cove .  simon rex is the best actor on the show .  it is suspenseful and exciting .  i think this show should stay on the air and i believe everyone should tune in to watch it .  i saw the very first episode and actually i wasn't going to watch it but i was watching lifetime one day and i decided to watch it because it was on and i absolutely love it and right now it's my favorite show .  i am really mean it . 
delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war 11 england .   lansbury was about age 51 at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part .  she is jessica fletcher again but this time it's for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril .   the film follows the adventures of miss price  ( lansbury )  and david tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery .  those 3 little darlings sent to live with price to escape the london bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age .   too bad that tessie o'shea ,  roddy mcdowall and sam jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film .   i really thought of the ben stiller film- " night at the museum ,  "  at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british coastal town . 
my observations :  postwar hilarity .  tom drake and grandpa from  " meet me in st .  louis "  two years later  ( the year i was born )  .  donna reed charming and pretty .  margaret hamilton good as always ;  smaller part than in  " wizard of oz "  .  spring byington way prettier ,  also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by hamilton .  tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious .  as a two year veteran of army tents ,  he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his eyes .   i used to work in a department store ,  and it was just as elegant as this one .  sadly ,  it has disappeared and faded into obscurity .  we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store ,  to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise .   10/10
i couldn't believe i spent $14 . 00 on this .  the only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore .  the dubbing was worse than any i have ever experienced .  it looks like it was shot with a vhs camcorder .  i think every pfennig was spent on the special effects because there was a whole lot of blood and body parts everywhere .  its one of the worst movies i have ever seen but i do have to acknowledge the plentiful gore that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and unbelievable
this film has a powerful philosophical ending .  but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning .   youth alienation in the late 1960's ,  from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman ,  is the obvious theme of  " zabriskie point "  .  neither mark frechette nor daria halprin had much acting experience ,  a fact that actually enhances the film's message .  having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism ,  as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them .   this is not a script-driven film .  except for the first ten minutes ,  it is mostly visual ,  with stunning cinematography .  the beautiful naturalistic images seem other-worldly ,  and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of mark and daria .   i would have replaced the thematically weak pink floyd music with the more cogent music of the doors .  many scenes cry out for  " riders on the storm "  .   even so ,  i like this film .  it's different ;  it's unique ;  it is artistic and imaginative .  and the desert badlands are beautiful .   as the years go by ,   " zabriskie point "  seems more and more attractive .  it conveys the mood of the late 1960's in america .  it is amazingly artistic ,  in a bohemian sort of way .  and the film's last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing . 
my comment is limited generally to the first season ,  1959-60 .   this superb series was one of the first to be televised in color ,  and it was highly influential in persuading americans that they had to buy a color television set ,  which was about $800 in 1959 ,  the equivalent of more than $3 , 000 today .  how many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a 17-inch screen ?  i was eleven when the series began ,  and i watched it from the beginning .   watching it now ,  50 years later ,  several things come to mind .  first ,  many of the story lines involve the comstock lode and the heyday of silver mining ,  which dates to 1859 .  for 1859 ,  the weapons and clothes are ,  for the most part ,  not authentic .   ( the haircuts are left out of the discussion .  )  that's basically a nitpick .   and ,  it would have been impossible for ben to have arrived in the lake tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100-square mile ranch in the next twenty years .  pioneers were still trying to solve the sierra nevada problem as late as 1847 ,  and the gold rush did not even begin until two years later .   indians are not played by native american actors .  john ford was using native american actors in the 1920s .  the bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later .  that is a major nitpick for me .   there are other time-line problems .  in season 1 ,  mark twain appears ,  and he is depicted as a middle-aged man .  mark twain was 24 years-old in 1859 .  the stories also vacillate between 1859-1860  ( pre-civil war )  and what was more suitable for an 1880 time-frame .  there are continuity problems ,  over and over .   it is somewhat off-putting ,  too ,  that there is so much killing in the first season .  in time ,  the killing was reduced .   many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant ,  which would be hard to believe ,  given the time-line ,  but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the nation's attitudes beginning in the 1960s .   having said all that ,  the acting is good ,  and i have come to conclude in my latter years that adam's character was drawn better than any other's .  i don't think pernell roberts ever got the credit he deserved .  also ,  season 1 reinforces the fact that dan blocker  ( hoss )  was a good actor .   many of the stories trace real historical events .  the guest stars were interesting .   this was great family entertainment ,  and the series stands up very well by any measure . 
i remember seeing this one when i was seven or eight .  i must have found the characters round ,  because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie .  and the ending ,  now that's sad ,  well .  .  .  for a 7-8 year old kid .   i had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately ,  and found that the plot was too simple ,  the character ,  two-dimensional .  .  .  i guess it's the kind of movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child .  .  .  pity .  .  .   i recommend this one for all you parents with small kids .  .  .   (  i saw it in its original french version ,  so i cannot tell you whether the translation is good or not .  ) 
 " hitler :  the rise of evil "  was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired ,  and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the film .   those who criticzed the film ,  which they hadn't seen ,  did so with good intentions ,  based on the misguided thought that it would be overly sympathetic to hitler .  however ,  they misunderstood the point :  to humanize the evil hitler is not sympathize with him .  it is far more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of history's greatest villains were committed by a human being .  a sick ,  diseased maniac ,  to be sure ,  but a human being nonetheless .  it is necessary to know the story of how hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again .    " rise of evil "  is highlighted by a brilliant ,  career best performance from robert carlyle ,  who makes hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way .  carlyle flawlessly captures the look and mannerisms of the nazi leader ,  while never letting the impersonation become cartoonish or distance us  ( something anthony hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed hitler in  " the bunker "  ,  another very good made-for-television film )  .  while were are repulsed by hitler's depravity and virulent ant-semitism ,  carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power the real adolf hitler must have possesed .  after all ,  while else would a nation have followed him ?   of the various subplots ,  by far the most compelling features matthew modine as reporter fritz gehrlich ,  who makes it his life's work to draw attention to the reality of of hitler and nazism .  while modine's performance is a little stilted in part 1 ,  by part 2 he seems to have settled in ,  the character gives us a real-life hero in a film full of villains .  peter stormare and liev schrieber also give strong support .   part 1 of this two-part mini series suffered a little bit from being overly choppy ,  including a look at hitler's childhood which lasts only the duration of the opening credits .  and in part 2 ,  sections detailing hitler's relationship's with his niece ,  and his mistress eva braun ,  are less successful than the central plot ,  but do serve to give us further insight into his mental and emotional state .   ultimately ,  no film about hitler can make us understand him .  the average person is ,  thankfully ,  incapable of ever understanding a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people .   " hitler :  the rise of evil "  tries less to make us understand hitler ,  and more to make us understand how he came to be power .  it is an important story that must be told ,  and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would accuse it of having anything but the best of intentions ,  and the capability of doing anything but good .   9 out of 10 .  *** 1/2
holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people .  one of them i will name ,  the other two are mysteries and will remain so .  holes is a story about stanley yelnats iv .  he is unlucky in life .  unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the yelnats men and has been since exploits of stanley iv's `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather . ' those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill-fated turn .  it is during just such a turn that we meet stanley iv .  he has been accused ,  falsely ,  of stealing a pair of baseball shoes ,  freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction ,  by a famous baseball player .  he is given the option of jail ,  or he can go to a character building camp .  `i've never been to camp before , ' says stanley .  with that the judge enthusiastically sends him off to camp green lake .   camp green lake is an odd place ,  with an odd philosophy ,  `if you take a bad boy ,  make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun ,  it will turn him into a good boy . ' we learn this little pearl of wisdom from mr .  sir  ( john voight )  one of the camp's `counselors . ' we get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man .  he at least wears his attitude honestly ;  he doesn't think he is nice .  the camp's guidance councilor ,  mr .  pendanski  ( tim blake nelson )  is a different matter entirely .  he acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor ,  but he quick ,  quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges .  the warden has a decided capacity for meanness ,  but other than that she is a mystery .  these three rule camp green lake ,  a place that has no lake .  it is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes ,  five feet deep and five feet wide .  its local fauna ,  seem only to be the vultures ,  and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards .  green lake seems is ,  in many ways ,  a haunted place .   holes works in spite of the strange setting ,  and the strange story ,  because it understands people .  specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of camp green lake .  the movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly .  it captures the way boys can bully each other ,  they way they can win admiration ,  the way they fight with one another ,  and the way boys ally themselves along the age line .  it is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable .  what is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character .  he does not believe in a family curse ,  he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather . ' in fact he loves hearing the story .  stanley iv is not bitter about the past ,  and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather .  there is at times a lot of sadness in the film ,  but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness .  and that is refreshing .   holes is an intelligent ,  insightful and witty family movie .  it entertains ,  and not in any cheap way .  it is not a comedy ,  though it has its laughs .  it dares to be compelling ,  where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional .  as such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy .  i give it a 10 . 
i have never seen the 1973 ,  older highly rated version .  i am a nicholas cage fan  ( by the way ,  fine acting as usual )  .  this movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot  ( i can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party )  ,  if you can't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining .  this is ,  of late ,  the terrible rut that hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror/mystery/thriller genre ,  unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh ,  smart ,  and tantalizing screenplay ,  they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater .  at least ,  it didn't have the jiggling hand-held camera syndrome . 
somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for  " casablanca "  ,  didn't he ?  or didn't he .  maybe there's more than one koch slinking around in hollywood ,  and i'm not too fond of  " casablanca "  anyway .  wait a minute -- yes ,  there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood .  that's the one who wrote  " casablanca .  "  no matter .  i'll put as much care into this comment as  " howard w .  koch "  put into this production ,  which is to say only a little .   you know what this sounds like ?  somebody read cliff's notes on shakespeare's  " king lear "  and decided ,  since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express ,  to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy ending .   there are differences .  lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so ,  asks them how much they love him .  two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money .  the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear .  but in the play ,  lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl .  he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors ,  putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating .  kids can do that to you .   ( take my kid ,  for instance .  after all the effort i squandered on raising him ,  does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer ?  no .  )  in the end ,  everybody in the play dies .   in the movie ,  evidently ,  the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself ,  somebody jumps in and saves her ,  so the ending is ,  more or less ,  happy .  that's the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy ,  unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself . 
seems everyone in this film is channeling woody allen .  they stammer and pause and stammer some more .  only for really die-hard denero fans !  it tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very ,  very low budget film made by college students .  the most often used word in the whole film is  " hum "  .  the film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixties/early seventies though .  if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other ,  horrible lighting  ( even if it is for  " art's sake "  )  ,  and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting ,  then you might like this - but you need to be really bored .  i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why . 
poor ivy :  though to the manner born ,  she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel  ( richard ney )  .  as the movie is set in the 20s or 30s ,  when rigid victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges ,  this uncertain status vexes her unduly .  the gretorexes  ( for so they are called )  don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her .  when ivy  ( joan fontaine )  makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent  ( herbert marshall ,  who must have been born middle-aged )  ,  she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him .  luckily ,  one of the beaux she still strings along  ( patric knowles )  is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison ,  with which she bids her hubby farewell .  the fact that it implicates knowles doesn't phase her a bit ,  even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead .  the turning of the plot depends on police inspector sir cedric hardwicke ;  knowles' mother  ( the redoubtable lucile watson )  ;  and knowles' loyal housekeeper  ( una o'connor )  .  sam wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama ;  fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest . 
i gave it a 2 just because natassia malthe  ( as the vampiress quintana )  looks sooooo sexy in this movie .   certainly there is very little logic to this movie ,  but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flicks .  the movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories .  unfortunately ,  it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable ,  but ridiculous .   there is too much gore and too many rip-off-the-body scenes that made me feel sick .  a good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don't need to see a lot of blood -- we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he/she is going to do what a vampire will do .  a few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene  ( like the one at end when quintana tries to sexually arouse rosa ,  all it needs is a few moans ,  the rest is your imagination )  .  anyway ,  it's just my personal taste . 
  a friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find ,  and i have a good laugh watching them with him .   i have told him if he puts this one on again i will be forced to give him a good kicking .   he knows i am serious !   
alain resnais films are uncanny in the way that they aren't really edited for continuity ,  but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited .  love unto death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie ,  and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the eros/thanatos relationship .  .  .  or perhaps creates a new relationship ,  that of agape/thanatos .   the beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie .  a woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed--did she kill him ,  or what happened ?  soon that tension is dissolved as a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead ,  but from there a newer ,  stranger drama begins :  the man wakes up ,  and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences .  meanwhile ,  their friends ,  who are both priests ,  watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love ,  faith ,  and devotion .   resnais always seems to have some device to make these sorts of narratives work ,  and what's so amazing about his films is that those devices always work .  in this case ,  resnais intercuts the scenes with shots of snow falling to an arousing orchestral score ,  which fades off and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story .  trapped in this elegiac aside periodically ,  the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem ,  and i got strange flashbacks to dante's divine comedy from this one ,  despite the lack of direct reference within the movie .  resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this extends past just the cinepoem structure to something that forces a degree of introspection in the viewer ,  which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd recollections .  memory-narrative ,  resnais creates .   --polarisdib
just a comment on new orleans accents .  .  .   an earlier reviewer noted the following :   " this film ,  could have been shot in new york ,  or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like  " broklynese "  than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country .  "  there was also another comment along these lines from an english reviewer .   many people in new orleans do ,  in fact ,  sound  " broklynese "  .  i have never found out why .   ( it's mentioned in  " a confederacy of dunces "  by john kennedy toole .  )  i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail ,  as this one did .  too often it's just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent . 
as a youth pastor i heard good things about this movie .  then i watched it .  the acting wasn't the best .  that's forgivable .  it's the message that's not :  give jesus your life and everything will change - you'll tackle better ,  make amazing catches ,  stop fumbling ,  start making touchdown passes ,  and even make the playoffs .  all because jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into all-american athletes .  i laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals .  but wait ,  that's not all .  you'll get a brand new truck ,  a $6000 raise ,  and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice .  then you'll win the state championship because god helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before - and into the wind ,  no less - all because  " god wanted him to make it .  "  then you'll win the state championship again the next year .  none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow jesus will all their hearts .   here's what i took away from the movie :  god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better ,  easier ,  and more enjoyable .  he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games .  which bible is this story based on ?  i'll bet saint stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death .  someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following jesus .  it would have saved them all a lot of trouble . 
 " cry freedom "  is not just a movie .  it is a historical account ,  heroic story ,  and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history .  not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating ,  determined hero ,  steve biko ,  but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid .  the story of biko ,  an influential leader ,  and his main  " influencee "  ,  donald woods ,  is a heartbreaking one .  but ,  the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa .   " cry freedom "  manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot .  it is because of great films like this one ,  that the public can become educated on terrible events in history ,  great leaders who sought to end them ,  and how we can never allow them to happen in the future .  because of this importance ,   " cry freedom "  is an amazing film that should be seen by all . 
i suck at gratuitous boob references ,  so i'm just going to write a plainly flat  ( no pun intended )  review .  i love elvira ,  not in a  " i'm-going-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical "  way ,  but suffice to say i think she rocks .  the movie is played like a 50's horror film only alot more fun ,  look for the  " leasurely stroking of the ankle "  reference to know what i mean .  what relay shines through in the movie is elvira's  ( or should that be cassandras )  absolute charm .  i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 ,  and have seen it contless times since .  .  i realy should get around to buying a copy ,  the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear .  if any other fans of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel free .   p . s another great performance from edie mcclurg  ( chastedy pariah )  an actress who never gets the attention she deserves . 
the movie is steeped in religion ,  so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it .  in my opinion ,  this movie pretends to explore deep issues ,  but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices ;  with little true insight .  what the people in the movie  ( and therefore ,  the writer )  failed to see was grace .  they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds .  to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful ,  and both the man & the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty ,  is just an oversimplification .  such stereotypes really don't exist ,  for even jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife's pleasure before his own .  scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh ,  and that no man ever hated his own flesh ,  but he nourishes and cherishes it .  even if you want to ignore the new testament ,  the writers & characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the song of solomon in the old testament ,  and the even the book of proverbs which says ,   " rejoice in the wife of thy youth ,  let her breasts satisfy you always "  !  how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows ,  and approves of ,  and smiles on ,  the marital union and the enjoyment thereof ?  real men don't ignore the value and needs of their wives .  those that do deny a very basic teaching of the judeo/christian religion .  god never said those things .  it's absurd .  sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true god of abraham .  it didn't need to be so .  how sad .  what sonia desperately needed was truth ,  not tradition .  in knowing ,  loving and obeying god ,  we love others more ;  before ourselves .  that is the faith of the god of abraham ,  isaac ,  jacob & joseph ;  once for all delivered to the saints ;  bought & paid for by jesus christ ,  the righteous .  but alright ,  ignore all this and abandon ancient ,  holy scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people & ghosts .  that's a good plan .  i would never recommend this movie ;  partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic ,  but also because it really doesn't offer any valuable insight .  check out  " yentl "  if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society . 
a serious comedy .  ross hunter-produced movie version of the french play  " les joies de la famille "   ( later americanized as  " a very rich woman "  )  is plush ,  well cast ,  occasionally funny .  .  . and unfortunately timeless .  a wealthy california widow ,  who appears to be frittering away her money ,  is railroaded by her two grown ,  greedy daughters ,  both of whom are afraid mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance .  the whole issue of a vital--but aged--woman sent to a rest home against her will ,  and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing ,  is touchy material for a comedy  ( and to his credit ,  director david lowell rich doesn't overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment )  .  some of the humor is a little broad and doesn't work ,  yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note .  sandra dee is also good as rosalind's granddaughter ,  and james farentino is very charming as a young lawyer .  the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly ,  and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time ,  that the seriousness of  " rosie !  " 's theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending .  the picture leaves you smiling--and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky .  *** from ****
considering that i felt like picking up a new jet li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting ,  i grabbed this title .   unfortunatly ,  this movie contains more gun battles  ( ala chow yun fat but nowhere near as good )  ,  than jet li and company's acrobatic fighting .  thus it was a let down .   the faucet fighting was interesting and even funny ,  considering this was something totaly unexpected in a jet li film for me ,  more on the line of say jackie chan .   but alas i'd recommend fist of legend ,  tai chi master ,  or even the enforcer over this dissapointment .   rating 4 for martial arts rating 3 for overall movie score
this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective .  while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward .  in truth ,  it is the standard story of a simple ,  honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period .   poor vs .  rich ,  honorable vs .  dishonorable ,  a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen .   extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen .   :  ) 
i'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals .  whatever the case ,  i'm sure i loved it .  from the wonderfully twisted ,  lurid ,  intertwining stories ,  to the deliciously sinister performances from robert stack and dorothy malone ,  to the vivid ,  gaudy colour with which it's all captured ,  this is high-class trash and it's great fun .  not to mention the amusingly sly and thinly veiled sexual subtexts which permeate the entire film ,  always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so .  i'd be lying if i said that the film's sheer entertainment value didn't contribute to my love for it ,  but there's some sort of bizarre artistry behind the unintentional  ( or was it ?  )  comedy and i really ,  really dug that .  i could really get into this melodrama stuff . 
this movie can be described in those 2 words  " just unbelievable "  .  this is the best movie ever made ,  i just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250 .  i also can't see why anybody would not love scarface .  anyways ,  if you havnt seen it ,  it is a must buy . 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen .   i usually praise any film for some aspect of its production ,  but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film .   most common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it .  er ok .   also ,  trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gonna work .  running 10 feet into some trees is not gonna work .  alas it does here .  as mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous .  in an enclosed space ,  with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea .   anyway ,  about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation .  however ,  if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate .   it pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made .   oh ,  did i mention the last five minutes ?  well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques .  absolutely priceless . 
the acting in this movie stinks .  the plot makes very little sense ,  but from what i gathered it's supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn people's personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies  ( or blow their heads up ,  whichever )  .  and the effects are lousy ,  too .  most of the movie consists of bad music ,  with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music ,  interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes .  this should be one of the worst things ever made ,  but for one thing .  one element of shear brilliance that makes  " nightmare weekend "  stand above all others .  and that special quality is the presence of george .   george is the lovable interface device between the scientist's daughter ,  jessica ,  and the home computer security system .  with his green hair and nose ,  balding scalp ,  and heart-shaped mouth ,  george is the guardian angel/confidant to jessica ,  who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid .  with his monotone synthesized voice ,  george tells jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses ,  and also that hitch-hiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars .  of course ,  little jessica just can't seem to stay out of trouble ,  causing george to execute  " emergency program code :  protection jessica "  ,  which results in the violent death of jessica's would-be assailant via one of the aforementioned steel balls .   kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light .  hal should have been represented by our friend george in order to better translate compassion for his eventual demise .  the light and sound show at the end of  " close encounters "  ?  not bad ,  but how much better would that movie had been if the means of first communication with the aliens had been george the hand puppet .  bishop ,  data ,  r2  kitchen appliances next to the almighty george !  he might only be in the movie for 8 minutes out of 90 ,  but don't be fooled .  this show is all about george .  with even that limited amount of screentime ,  george joins the ranks of such luminous film characters as hollywood montrose ,  majai ,  and pappy from  " new moon rising "  as icons of american cinema .   " george to apache "   you are my hero . 
yay !  .  .  .  i think .  it's hard to say .  it's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion .  this movie is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel .  for a setting ,  it has a few stone pillars ,  some stone seats ,  a couple stone crosses and some stone actors .  they have no emotion !  the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet ,  and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature .  the dubbing really wasn't all that bad though .  the voices stuck true to the dull ,  gloomy ,  dreary ,  life-sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth .  i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater 3000 three times ,  and each of the three times ,  i was on the brink of turning off the tv ,  despite it being mst 3k .   not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better . 
for those of you that don't that reference ,  clubberin was 4 fists hitting one body .  .  .   anyways ,  onto the review .   i miss wcw saturday night .  some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage .  i remember watching stunning steve austin ,  rick rude ,  brian pillman ,  cactus jack ,  dustin rhodes ,  johnny b .  badd ,  ddp in his jobber days ,  lord steven regal ,  harlem heat ,  ricky steamboat ,  sting .  .  . i'd be here a while listing everyone .  point is wcw had an awesome roster in the pre hogan days and they were producing entertaining television .  dusty rhodes on commentary in it's later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when i started smoking pot as a teenager .  .  . i really wish vince would put him on the mic for a show or two ,  maybe at the next great american bash ?  they clubberin !  here comes da plunda !  he was great .   -dirrty
an old vaudeville team of willy clark  ( walter matthau )  and al lewis  ( george burns )  were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other .  over 20 years later they agree to get together for a tv special .  .  . but find out they still hate each other .  willy's nephew/agent  ( richard benjamin )  tries to get them to work together .   a big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor .  i  ( somewhat )  liked it .  it was written by neil simon so its non-stop one-liners .  some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and al's senility was not .  also i never liked matthau .  i never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way .  also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly .  all that aside this was fun .  burns is just great tossing off one-liners with ease and even matthau was good matching him .  their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie .  also benjamin is very good as willy's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other .  for me it's worth seeing for burns alone .  this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with  " oh god "  .  so ,  this is good .  just good--not great .  matthau's character really makes this hard to love .  i give it a 7 . 
i just watched this horrid thing on tv .  needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get .  frankly ,  i don't know how much lower the bar can go .    the characters are composed of one lame stereo-type after another ,  and the obvious attempt at creating another  " bad news bears "  is embarrassing to say the very least .   i have seen some prized turkeys in my time ,  but there is no reason to list any of them since this is  " numero uno "  .   let me put it to you this way ,  i watched the vanilla ice movie ,  because it was so bad it was funny .  this .  .  . this .  .  . is not even that good . 
this 1998 film was based on a script by the late edward d .  wood ,  a script that featured no dialogue in the tradition of films such as the thief .  while much of wood's work was quirky low-budget entries into various genre-film traditions ,  his first released feature glen or glenda was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avant-garde techniques .  i woke up early the day i died represents that side of ed wood ,  the experimenter ,  although this film is a comedy  ( a nightmarish comedy ,  however !  )  ,  while the cross-dressing theme of glen or glenda was taken so seriously by wood that there was not room for comedy there .  from the first few seconds of this film i knew that i was being taken to a new cinematic world ,  and i can't really compare that world with anything else .  the technical side of the film--production design ,  sound design ,  music scoring ,  photography ,  etc . --is groundbreaking on any number of levels .  in particular ,  although the film has no  " dialogue "  there is sound of all kinds and also  " language "  ,  but you'll have to see how it's done yourself ,  as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout .  the glen or glenda-esque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum .  the whole film is played at a hysterical fever-pitch ,  and billy zane provides an amazing tour-de-force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is .  in a just world ,  he would have been given some award for this performance .  he even looks like ed wood ,  and as played by zane this character is at various timesfunny ,  sleazy ,  tragic ,  sympathetic ,  and anonymous ( sometimes simultaneously !  !  !  )  .  what a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a north american theatrical or video release ,  only playing a few festivals .  right now ,  it's only available on video in germany  ( in fact ,  my copy is from a german source--the excerpts from wood's screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german ,  although the newspaper headlines  ( that great low-budget technique of giving plot elements ,  especially those that would be too expensive to film ,  via newspaper headlines is used here in the wood tradition ) that zane sees are in english )  .  i think that this film could have gotten a word-of-mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion .  and if played off city by city slowing on the art-film circuit ,  it could have done well .  in fact ,  if the legal issues can be resolved ,  i'd like to suggest that the film should still be given a theatrical release ,  especially a midnight  " cult "  release .  this is a classic waiting to be discovered .   did i  " understand "  every scene ?  no ,  but i  " felt "  every scene emotionally .  did everything  " work "  in the film ?  perhaps not .  i've only seen it twice ,  and the first time i saw it i was interruped a number of times .  however ,  with all the assembly-line junk playing the multiplexes and with so much  " alternative "  film being fetishistic or pretentious shot-on-video film-school rejects ,  we need actual hollywood-made experimentation like this .  the recent bob dylan film  " masked and anonymous "  took similar chances as did something like steven soderbergh's full frontal .  this film could find an audience much larger than either of those .  if you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing ,  see if it has ever been released on video .  you will not be bored .  invite some friends over .  .  . make it a party .  play the amazing soundtrack loud .  i have a feeling that ,  wherever he is in the afterlife ,  ed wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film .  wood's probably also laughing that ,  just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life ,  the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making . 
this is a real eye candy .  a world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities .  huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is hurling cathedrals at their opponents .  .  .  who can resist that ?  an ancient prophecy ,  a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero .  .  .  sounds familiar .  .  .  ?  yes we heard that song before .  but you will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery .   this movie is fun to watch while it lasts .  but after leaving the cinema you'll be longing for a little bit more story .   what is behind the 30-years-circle ?  what drove the knight crazy ?  who built all these fabulous monuments ,  castles and cities .  .  .  and why are they falling apart ?  and apart from that one bunch of farmers ,  where are the people ?  really ,  this picture looks so intriguing ,  but it's no lord of the rings . 
i will admit that i have seen maybe five minutes of  " jerry springer "  .  i don't consider myself a snob ,  but i really think that i am above watching what's on his show .  you should try to elevate yourself above that too .   i saw this movie as part of a social studies event i was conducting .  i was told that this movie really had little to do with springer himself ,  rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on  " springer .  "  handled better ,  this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives actually are .  i will admit ,  i felt a twinge of empathy for connie  ( molly hagan )  .  this is all she has in life .  how sad that she feels she must go on jerry's show in order to resolve this .   i really feel sorry for molly hagan appearing in this .  have you noticed that after this movie ,  she has mainly been relegated to  " b "  roles on tv ?  i will say this about hagan .  she is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman .  i have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy .  the problem is that hagan can't carry a scene on her own .  she just doesn't have what it takes to do a lead role .  her best work will always be angel on  " herman's head "   ( a show that was not great ,  but its heart was in the right place )  and when she guested on  " seinfeld "  as sister roberta . 
i must say this movie is a mork and mindy knock off ,  when watching it i got the chills ,  i even wet myself a little .  when that korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time .  any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being .  some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past .  this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr .  norris mailbox .  he can raise my kid i'm not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life . 
well ,  one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was .  gutsy would be the right term .  not only did he use a total cast of five people  ( no extras at all )  ,  but he also decided to use sub-par special effects with a confusing and boring plot ,  he also ,  and i am not kidding ,  put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die of fright !  !  !  however ,  they do promise a freeeeee coooofffffffiiiiinnnnn .  to have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move .  yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .  .  .  .   if you watch mystery science theater 3000 ,  you might've seen this .  they like to showcase horrible movies ,  just to let you know .   a good gift for someone you hate . 
ok - as far as the 2 versions of this movie .  there were 2 people involved in the making - john korty and bill couterie  ( george was just the producer - he really didn't have any kind of say so in the film - just helped with money )  - the 'adult' version was made possible by bill couterie .  john korty didn't like or approve this version  ( as it was done behind his back )  .  thanks to ladd films going under ,  they didn't advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for  " the right stuff "  ,  hoping it would pull them through ;  .  .  .  and it didn't .  so ,  this movie never really had a chance .  when  " twice "  made it to cable  ( hbo )  - they showed the reels with bill's version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore  ( did you notice how the 'adult' version wasn't on for very long ?  )  .  showtime got the 'clean' version .  the version on the videotape and laser-disc is the version approved by john  ( who holds more power than bill )  .  it's a pity ,  really ,  as the 'adult' version is actually better and does make more sense .  but it's very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd  ( or any other format short of bootleg )  .  sorry to disappoint everyone .  i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club  ( still have numerous items from the movie - used to own a letter-boxed version of the 'adult' version ,  but it was stolen - only have a partial hbo copy of it now )  .  8 stars to the 'adult' version - 5 to the 'clean' version .  any other questions ,  just ask . 
other than susan hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made .  henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes ,  and peck is ,  as always ,  impeccable .  the stirring alfred newman sound score ,  with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years .  the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side ,  but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made .  this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day ,   " the song of ruth "  and  " esther and the king .  "  it is worth watching ,  and raymond massy is excellent as the prophet nathan .  the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as abishai and jayne meadows as michol ,  david's estranged first wife . 
i agree with most if not all of the previous commenter's tom  ( bighouseaz@yahoo . com )  .  the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement .   i have seen zatoichi 1-13 , 15 , 16 ;  i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1  ( usa )  .  zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing .  the story line was complicated ,  and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines .  at one point ,  i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film .   this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects  ( a head rolling ,  limbs severed ,  blood )  and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character .  all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action ,  and won a great following without having to resort to effects .   i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend .  this is the first zatoichi film from his studio .  i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films -- and recommend them . 
the episodic version of robert heinlein's starship troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace ,  following johnny rico leaving his parents ,  the  ( not very attractive )  girl he lusts for ,  and joining the mobile infantry .  the aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film ,  instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths .   throughout watching this version ,  i was continually amazed at just how fruity they've managed to make the whole thing .  the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits ,  and the aching ,  prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors ,  with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving *during* the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes .  in terms of construction ,  it owes a debt to top gun ,  sharing much in terms of pacing and content  ( and all that implies )  . 
there are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former .  this short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience .  it presents a simple story ,  told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going ,  then just gets better and better .  clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam rockwell and luiz guzman can easily make it on their own .  likeable and funny ,  hilariously so towards the end ,  welcome to collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre . 
one of the last classics of the french new wave .  for direction ,  cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema ;  for story ,  eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life .  so many things can be said of this film - observationally brilliant ;  self indulgently overlong ;  occasionally hilarious ;  emotionally draining .  .  . etc .  etc .  in my mind ,  whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths .  every film student ,  writer ,  or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts ,  no music video overstyling ,  no soap opera-like plot twists ,  and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie .  everything is to be admired :  the writing  ( concise ,  clever ,  surprisingly funny )  ,  acting  ( everyone ,  quite simply ,  is perfect in their respective roles )  ,  and ,  simple direction  ( the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film )  make this film unforgettable .  this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you . 
a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent  ( a non-speaking part ,  as i recall )  .  he brought it over on dvd so i could see it .  it was  " interesting "  ,  but very much felt like an amateur film .  a well made amateur film ,  though .  really boring and poorly written .  it was probably fun to make and be involved in ,  but it definitely didn't deserve any kind of wide release .  maybe in omaha they'd enjoy it ,  but this california girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend's involvement .   if this film maker has made or makes any more films ,  he really should try to have a really interesting story line ,  and good actors .  i'm sure this was a great learning tool for them .  i wish them luck in the future ,  and hope they can improve their film making . 
being a ni supporter ,  it's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists .  characters who are hard to root for ,  typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages ,  and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward watch .  .  . 
 ( you'll know what i mean after you've seen red eye .  .  .  )    overall ,  red eye was a better-than-expected thriller .  it gets off to a slow start ,  and slowly builds .  but by the time it was over ,  it's a thumper !    it's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as .  .  .  thrilling as i found it .  except that ,  simply put ,  the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run-of-the-mill plot .  i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie .  that says a lot .   other factors ,  i think ,  are the  " closeness "  of victim and bad guy .  .  .  and that over time ,  you begin to really relate to the victim .  a scant 8 out of 10 ,  more like a 7 . 5 .  .  .  but that's pretty good ! 
for some reason ,  in the late 70's and early 80's the local cbs affiliated station in new york kept playing this movie in it's late-night slot on friday or saturday nights for several years ,  usually at 2 a . m .  or some such time .  it's a fitting movie for that time slot since it's really hard to follow and quite odd  ( see the other reviews for specific story info )  .  anyway ,  after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable tv  ( and even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming )  ,  i kept catching this little oddity .  after not seeing it for many years i decided to see if i could find it on dvd .  well ,  it is only available  ( from every search i've conducted anyway ) in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label  " brentwood video "  as part of a 4-pack of movies  ( 4 movies on 2 double sided discs ) called  " alien worlds "  if anyone is interested .  it's usually available for around $10-but even much less if you shop around .  the other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies ,  so no need to comment on them here .  but i haven't seen  " eyes "  available anywhere else .  though hardly a  " restored "  version in any way ,  this print runs exactly 92 minutes ,  so for once imdb's stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct .  even with the 92 minute running time it's not unusual for a movie dubbed into english from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed .  it seems to be a common budget-conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story .  would a longer version make in any less confusing ?  who really knows-unless you've seen it in it's native language .  .  .  by the way ,  my attempts to watch this during the day don't work and i end up just turning it off .  there's something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie .  . or maybe it's just from my earlier experiences ,  who know ?  ? 
yes ,  chunky ,  this is the nick-name that donna reeds' romantic lead played by tom drake tags her with !  so lets get this clear right away .  from her first ingénue role in the get-away  ( 1941 )  too her last ,  dallas  ( 1984-1985 )  ms .  reed could never be described as chunky .  not this attractive and slim actress .  whose roles at m . g . m .  seldom lived up to her talents .   ms .  reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors ,  who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw-ball' comedy .  clearly m . g . m .  was out of their depth making this type of film .  a type better produced over at columbia ,  paramount ,  rko and even universal .  neither the 'touch' of ernst lubitsch nor the wit of preston sturges could save this film .  a rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre-war  ( wwii )  effort .   if irving thalberg had still been alive the screen-play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day .  it did fit into louis b .  mayer's 'safe-zone' of none challenging family entertainment .  a form that could not stand up to the post-war challenges of the 'dehavilland decision' ,  loss of their theater chains ,  television and would contribute to m . g . m . s decline .  fortunetly for donna reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity  ( 1953 )  and her oscar win as best supporting actress . 
***spoilers*** with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean ,  john carradine ,  to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune ,  some 140 million dollars .  the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion .  there seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that it's really an overnight sleepover ,  not a weeks vacation ,  at the mansion for the guests to qualify for dean's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise .   the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia ,  rodolfo acosta .  acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests .  later that evening cute little chin greg and laura's , jeff morrow & marry anders , little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond .   the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until it's revealed who the killer really is .  we then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest .  the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot ,  140 million dollars ,  but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him ,  or her ,  in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot .   nonsensical who done it ,  and haunted house ,  movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother ,  much less the audience ,  would have trouble liking .  there's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest s&m sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder .  you just couldn't care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do .   even the big surprise at the end isn't really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself !  we then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is .  the final plot-twist ,  that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away ,  was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie . 
spoiler !  !  i love branagh ,  love helena bonham-carter ,  loved them together in  " mary shelley's frankenstein "  - but this -  i can understand an actor's desire to stretch ,  to avoid the romantic stereotype .  well ,  they did ,  but really - the script droned on ,  bonham-carter's clothes were tres chic ,  and the occasional speeded-up  " madcap "  sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles' movie ,  or the old rowan and martin laugh-in .   i never got the point - other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer .  i never felt that .  he was a loser ,  and not very bright ,  and certainly not endearing .  the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch .  certainly not amusing .   bonham-carter's realistic  ( one supposes )  attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in  " full monty .  "   the poetic ending ,  with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated .  was there a choir of angels ,  or merely a soundtrack ?   go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it .  donate this to pbs .   
first of all i must admit batman :  the animated series is the best batman series by far .  we watched it when it used to be on tv .  i didn't realize that there was a season four .  actually there wasn't .  btas ends with season 3 ,  and it should have stopped there .   why did they have to mess with a good thing .  catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible grey faces .  the joker looks beyond scary ,  it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier .  he doesn't seem to have pupils anymore ,  and now he doesn't even look remotely human  ( although he is )  .   bruce wayne is voiced by kevin conroy who does the best batman .  although he now looks like superman .  there is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same ,  bruce wayne now has blue eyes .   night wing really needs a haircut ,  please !  alfred just has pupils from eyes ,  looks more like a character from the 80's .   i have watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series and i already find that this version is more violent and graphic  ( there is blood in every episode )  .   if you are a fan of batman :  the animated series ,  there is no batman season 4 .  they just included this series as season 4 for marketability .  if they just released it as the new batman adventures i don't think as many people would have bought it .   save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1-3 . 
a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too .  the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food  (  a mirror of the magnifiscent seven )  .  there is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too .  you will love it !  !  8 out of 10
as i mentioned previously ,  john carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by  ( the other being the classic conan the barbarian )  .  it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers ,  whom i eventually befriended  ( imaginary friend )  to keep him from killing me in my sleep .  now that is terror for a 10 year old .   it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves .  the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works ,  perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious .  this all could happen .  it isn't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country  ( as most modern horror is ,  i . e .  hostel ,  touristas ,  cry wolf ,  saw , etc )  .  at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations .  i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head .  it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create .  so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety .   carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday ,  middle class ,  suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister .  he then spends the next 15 years in an institution  ( which we thankfully do not experience )  only to escape and return to his hometown ,  the infamous haddonfield .  on his way he kills and kills .  the child's name is michael meyers ,  though he is not a person .  john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia .  in the bastion of american safety and security ,  chaos can still strike .   michael ceased to be a person once he killed .  he is not a serial killer ,  human being or psychopath .  he is as unstoppable force .  the generic overalls ,  bleached-white shatner mask ,  and lack of any dialog other then some breathing ,  helps to dehumanize and complete michael's generification .  this is the source of all his power .  he is faceless ,  speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos .  this is helped by the cinematography  ( post card effect )  ,  a lack of information/motivation/explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence  ( dr .  loomis )  .  his over the top performance and uneasiness sells  " the shape "  .  this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode ,  the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds  ( at least for a little bit )  .    though this isn't the first movie of this new niche of horror films  ( black christmas came out 4 years earlier )  ,  it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing .  if you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time  ( like me )  ,  this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack .  i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter's career . 
not a bad word to say about this film really .  i wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly .  i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories ,  mine being one of them .  the film delivers in the shock ,  gore and atmosphere department .  the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus .  it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business .  the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard ,  if a little wooden in some spots ,  and the effects are very real and gritty .  all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book .  i've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer's p . o . v shot .  and i ask :  what's wrong with that ?  ?  ?  it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer's identity a secret .  the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist ( killer revealed )  is not handled with more care ,  i mean it just happens kind of quickly ,  though the great performances make it just about credible .  aside from that pranks is a great movie  ( though i prefer the original title )  and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap .  its more than that ,  but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher .  what a shame .  .  .  .  its a really good movie people !  believe me ! 
the only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it .   in every other way ,  this film is a very lame rip-off of jaws ,  lake placid ,  and alligator ,  with a little bit of godzilla  ( 1998 )  thrown in .   as is standard for a 1990's-style horror movie ,  the two non-starring females each take their clothes off at least once .  the female lead doesn't ,  since she obviously has a better agent .    the whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing ,  in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters .  in this film ,  a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area .  people get eaten .  the movie ends .   i don't mind a bad horror movie ,  but i really hate a dull bad horror movie ,  which this definitely is . 
this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast ,  a gripping story with a chilling ending ,  great music ,  and excellent visuals without significant special effects .  it is interesting to note though that ,  like so much science fiction ,  its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted .  that's not to say we're out of the woods yet ,  but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition .  it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics :   " 1984 "  ,   " 2001 :  a space odyssey  ( compare its space station with our international space station )  and isaac asimov's  " i robot "   ( positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's )  . 
out of the first five episodes of hammer's short-running  " hammer house of horror "  series ,  this fifth episode with the wonderful title  " the house that bled to death "  is arguably the creepiest one .  as a great fan of the hammer studios' gothic horror films for many years ,  i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently .  so far ,  i've only seen the first five episodes ,  and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come ,  but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are ,  i will be satisfied .  whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor ,  this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror .  the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations .  years later ,  william  ( nicholas ball )  and emma peters  ( rachel davies )  move in the house with their little daughter sophie  ( emma ridley )  .  soon after moving in ,  however ,  the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house ,  which is seemingly haunted .  .  .  the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry ,   " growing pains "   ( episode 4 )  ,  and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances .  the film is also well-made in terms of effects ,  cinematography and score .   " the house that bled to death "  is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer-fans should like to see in a short horror tale .  the film delivers a creepy atmosphere ,  genuine scare moments and intelligent twists ,  and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end .  overall ,  this is highly recommendable to hammer fans . 
i saw this film first on my way home from paris to newark aboard air france in august 1996 .  the film itself i believe is quite a masterpiece .  it's the kind of film that people should be making .  i still think daniel auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around .  in this french film ,  he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a down syndrome man who lives in an institution with other down syndrome patients .  the actors including the actor who actually has down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men .  daniel's life and ours changes forever with the down syndrome man .  he realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about .  the ending is kind of silly though but i still think it's one of my favorite movies .  it's enough to bring a tear to your eye . 
all of the reviews here about how much zp lacks plot ,  the acting is wooden ,  the orgy scene makes no sense ,  etc .  ,  all miss the main point .   let's be honest .  this is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s los angeles .  it is a movie meant to be watched while your are h-i-g-h out of your mind on some psychedelic substance .   find some kind bud and smoke up ,  or get a mild hit of acid .  seriously ,  these straight and sober reviews of zp miss the point .  you can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind .   until you've watched this movie on the big screen  ( which i am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when zp was quite rare )  tripping out ,  you have no idea what this movie is all about .   if you insist on watching it not intoxicated ,  you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink floyd's wonderful re-working of  " careful with that axe ,  eugene ,  "   " come in number 51 ,  your time is up .  " 
 ( r#97 )   there is one good thing about this poor man's pokémon  ( make of that what you will )  :  the opening theme .  it has to be the coolest theme music of any sloppily dubbed japanese made-for-the-consumers-oops-i-mean-the-young-fans anime tv show .  unfortunately there was need to add some sort of show after the opening theme .  and they just couldn't come up with something more interesting than people arguing loudly about whose cards are better than the others' cards .  freud would have a field day ,  unfortunately i can't imagine why any kids would want to sit through a show where dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the running time .    " my uber-fantastical doomsday creature of ultimate doom will take your measly pyramid diamond animal in a single strike !  can't you see that you have no chance of winning this battle ,  you fool ?  !  hahahahhahhaha !  "    " oh yeah ?  well watch this !  i am about to use my destruction force delta times pie card which eradicates every single one of your power munchers and renders your uber-fantastical doomsday creature of ultimate doom's destroy beyond all significance attack useless !  i bet you didn't see that one coming !  "    seriously ,  that's all they ever do in this show ,  talk .  whereas in another crappy kids' show i used to watch ,  namely the commercial phenomenon pokémon  ( every soccer mum's pet peeve )  ,  at least the monsters had the courtesy to duke it out every once in a while ,   " yu-gi-oh "  is just ,  in the quiet words of roger ebert's a clockwork orange review ,   " plain talky and boring "  .  not to mention long-winded  ( i realize i'm being hypocritical here considering the sentence i just wrote )  .   this show goes on forever .  i don't know if there's any plot ,  and the static monsters have none of the character of pokémon .  even when not compared to my fave cartoon as a kid ,  this show sucks .  it's unintentionally funny ,  but not funny enough to be worth seeing .  bye bye ,  sleep tight ,  dream wet dreams . 
there is no reason to see this movie .  a good plot idea is handled very badly .  in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense .  the reason for the killings are not made clear .  the acting is awful .  nick stahl obviously needs a better director .  he was excellent in in the bedroom ,  but here he is terrible .  amber benson from buffy ,  has to change her character someday .  even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed .  even though the movie was 80 minutes ,  which is too short for a good movie  ( but too long for this one )  , there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters .   don't spend the time on this one . 
i viewed this movie in dvd format .  my copy may have been affected but i was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the dvd .  i will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was claire forlani .  while fun to watch ,  i feel she didn't live up to my expectations that i have so far found from her other films .  i actually was equally pleased to see arkin turn in a humorous performance .  the other two actors i wasn't very familiar with so i can't compare their performance ,  however they were fairly enjoyable also .  the acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion .  the story line ,  while some could say slightly compelling ,  lacked direction .  i feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film .  if you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then i recommend this film ,  but otherwise leave it alone . 
this is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians  ( i am both )  .  during the first half of the twentieth century ,  sadly ,  black americans were usually not allowed into white theaters .  as a result ,  theaters catering to black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the black experience and showing black actors .  in many cases ,  the films were essentially similar plot-wise to standard hollywood fare ,  but with a much ,  much lower budget--and usually horrid production values .  you really can't fault the film makers--they just didn't have the money and resources available to the average film company .  as a result ,  they had to make due with a lot less--including an over-reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again ,  no money for re-shooting scenes and a need to get the films done fast !  this film tried very hard to be a black version of a gene autry film--starring herb jeffries instead .  jeffries was a light-skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films .  in each ,  he sings a little ,  fights a little  ( though very poorly )  and loves a little--everything you need in a cowboy .  believe it or not ,  jeffries is still alive at age 96 .   the general plot was indiscernible from an autry picture--complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out west !  the problem is that despite its similarities ,  the low budget shines through .  stymie  ( from the li'l rascals )  flubbed a few lines but they just left it in ,  the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film ,  there were some odd plot holes ,  there was no background music  ( leaving the film strangely quiet )  and the acting was pretty awful .   now this does not mean that the film isn't worth seeing--only that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher .  one reviewer ,  oddly ,  scored this film a 10 !  how this can be with all the problems is beyond me .  however ,  i can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems .  the plot is generally pretty good ,  the characters likable ,  the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard and it's a very important piece of american history .  but a 10 !  ?    by the way ,  in an odd bit of casting ,  the very tall ,  lean and almost white-skinned jefferies is paired with short ,  dumpy and exceptionally dark mantan moreland .  .  .  . as his brother !  !  also ,  spencer williams may be familiar to you .  he played andy on tv's  " amos 'n andy "  . 
this is a masterpiece footage in b/w 35mm film .  the film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 7 : 35 am in a bar and how much things can happen there in 8 minutes .   the short amazingly ,  gets you in a complex story using very little elements ,  and step to step makes you realize that something isn't totally right .  it expresses a lot ,  makes your adrenalin go high with subtle details ,  and is incredibly understandable by anyone ,  not just the cinema critics experts .   but i know how it sounds  :  european short ,  black and white and low budgeted .  don't let that scare you .  is really worth to see by anyone ,  not just experts in the genre .   isn't really much more to tell ,  since the film just lasts 8 minutes  ( exactly )  ,  and i don't want to spoil it .  but i just watched it online and i couldn't understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment about it .   really worth watching it .  10/10 . 
until now ,  the worst movie i had ever seen was ben & arthur .  you really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one .  the review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it ,  evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online .  at least the people who made ben & arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs ,  instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it .   everything about this movie is terrible ,  the script ,  the story ,  the casting ,  the acting ,  the direction ,  the photography ,  the editing ,  the music .  .  .  what else goes into a movie ?  whatever it is ,  here it's as bad as it gets .  if it weren't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous .  i kept watching it thinking it must get better ,  because i hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable .   it does not take a lot of money to make a great movie ,  nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad .  my favorite example of a shoestring-budget masterpiece is gus van sant's amazing mala noche ,  but there are many others .  sideline secretsdirector's cut or originalis bad not because the people who made it had no money ,  but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything at all except self-promotion . 
i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film .  thought visually stunning like all of ang lee's work  ( each still frame seems worthy of a print )  ,  i was really disappointed by the film's disjointed pace .  it really was too long .   the story is set in civil war era missouri ,  and is about a young man  ( roedel )  who joins the feral forces of the bushwackers ,  sort of renegade confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the jayhawkers ,  their union counterparts .  he and his close friend ,  jack bull chiles played by skeet ulrich ,  join the group after chile's father is shot point-blank and his home is burned ,  presumably by jayhawkers .  the story follows roedel's and chiles' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war ,  including former slave who fights for the bushwhackers  ( daniel holt played by jeffery wright )  ,  and a war widow played by jewel .   it seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point ,  it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped .  for example ,  the agitation among roedel's group caused by former slave holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol ,  and then dropped until later in the movie .  a young villian/bully bushwhacker hates roedel and directs much angst and violence against him ,  but ,  we never know why .  some of the characters never seem to surface ;  i think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history .   the historical detail was excellent .  i loved looking at the housing ,  furniture ,  clothes ,  etc .  ,  and i thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters ,  though they stumbled a bit with the dialog .  unless you really enjoy history or are a huge ang lee fan ,  though ,  take a pass on this one . 
writer/director peter greenaway cements his title as the high lord of art house pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-indulgence ,  8 ½ women .  the film follows a wealthy englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction ,  as they lure and blackmail women  ( guess how many )  into joining their personal collection of concubines .   think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive ,  and chances are greenaway's done it .  the female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of .  there's the kabuki-obsessed mio ,  the ever-pregnant giaconda and beryl ,  who's got a thing for farm animals .  giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair ,  she's the  " half woman ,  "  get it ?  greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny ,  but if this isn't it ,  then what is ?   the film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with japan ,  a continuation of themes from his snore-worthy  ( but less sexist )  1996 film ,  the pillow book .  but where the the pillow book was erotic and graceful ,  8 ½ women just gets horny and exploitative .  greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism ,  and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself . 
i considered myself to be quite melancholy ,  especially when i watch a great touching and tear-jerking movies .  but not for this one  ( which surprised me !  )  and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly .   there are several disturbing facts throughout the movies :  1 .  despite guilt-ridden ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past ,  i find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action .  some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly ,  in the end this was a disturbing action to me .   2 .  the movie story line is over-dramatized ,  but the logic is over-simplified .  medically ,  blood type match is required to be an organ donor .  toward the end of the film we learnt that emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period .  nevertheless ,  it seemed that ben had the rare blood type ,  same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently ,  despite the rarity of ben's blood type ,  he was able to donate not only his heart ,  but also his kidney ,  his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen .   3 .  why the doctors allow ben's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself ?   i might be over-analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie .  however ,  some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie .  if you go for a soap-opera type of film ,  go for it .  but it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment ,  give this one a miss ! 
i had really only been exposed to olivier's dramatic performances ,  and those were mostly much later films than *divorce* .  in this film ,  he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy merle oberon ,  and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm . 
the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous .  the plot is awful .  .  . but on the plus side the acting is pretty good ,  with a few good shouts and rants .  sharon stone is ok this time .  .  . not even half as good as the original mind you .  the murders aren't as gory as the first one either ,  which is a shame .  its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though .  the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake  ( they are fully clothed )  .  the script is weak most of the time ,  but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr . glass and washburn are highlights .  the plot twists a few times ,  but the ending is awful .  the tension is always constant with a huge dollop of 'oh my god ! ' .  the chase sequences are brilliantly directed ,  and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise ,  rush-felt film .  sharon stone is a bit old for this too .  the bits where we see her breasts were ,  in the first one ,  delights .  this time around ,  they are too horrid to describe .  the films its self is rather average ,  but it is worth a go .  mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz .  .  . with the opening sequence being a highlight .  not to be critical ,  but if you liked the first one - leave this one .  don't ruin the run .  you'll be glad you left this stone unturned . 
in the u . s .  ,  very few films have been made about rome that were not set in the time of julius caesar or shortly thereafter .  hollywood's sword and sandal epics mostly have a christian theme ,  which makes it difficult to get into earlier roman history  ( spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule ,  and encountered some resistance in hollywood because it did not have jesus in it )  .   it's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of caesar and christ ,  but is set when rome was only one city among many on the italian peninsula ,  and had just ousted the hated king tarquin and formed the republic .   however ,  this is not a historical film ;  it's peplum ,  and while the production values aren't rock bottom ,  the acting and characterizations are cardboard .  i can only imagine what the dialogue was like in italian ,  but with wooden english dubbing it's very campy .  i got a few good laughs out of it at first .   i haven't seen many films of this genre ,  having missed most of the hercules movies of the 60s .  it's amusing up to a point ,  but as the film goes on ,  it gets somewhat boring .   one thing's for sure :  if i'd seen this movie when i was ten years old ,  i would have loved it .  at that age ,  i went for anything with romans and swordfights in it .  so at least ,  this flick brought back some childhood memories . 
worst film ever ,  this is a statement that people here on imdb often throw around .  whether it's an uwe boll movie ,  bad classics like manos the hands of fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from michael bay ,  people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world .   i envy these people ,  because they're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes .  there are films out there so bad ,  so hideous ,  so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad .   ladies and gentlemen ,  i present to you ben and arthur ,  an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash ,  you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it .  the brainchild of self proclaimed  " hollywood actor ,  director "  and may i add beached whale sam mraovich ,  this film is legendarily terrible .  let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was .  mr mraovich not only directed this film ,  he wrote it ,  produced it ,  executive produced it ,  scored it ,  edited it and then finally starred in it .  this is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is .   everything in this film fails on an epic level ,  the acting is the worst you will ever witness ,  the plot is the most ridiculous ,  the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard .  i'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent here ,  but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it ,  i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel ,  but the truth is it wasn't even shot on film ,  it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust .  don't get me wrong ,  i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting ,  for example as much as i disliked it the blair witch project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film .  ben and arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on ,  even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with hollywoods finest actors it would still suck ,  the plot is that atrocious ,  and the characters are even worse .  one of the main characters arthur who is portrayed by non other than sam mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film .  you'll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing .  apparently mr mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero .   i don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film  ( which i urge you not to pay for )  so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is ,  tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie .  in one cut we hear one of the main characters say how  " they know a good lawyer and will give him a call "  the shot fades out then fades back in and this him they spoke of earlier is actually a woman ,  quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think .  the second is simple ,  seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to vermont ,  we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area .  i've never been to vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there .   imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still won't fully prepare you for ben and arthur .  imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as ben and arthur ,  this film is really that bad .   however we should be glad in a way ,  films like this are a true rarity .  they give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters .  simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this .   the real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered ,  and it is called ben and arthur . 
as one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film ,  i found this to be a very disappointing movie .   yes ,  it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the  ( highly )  morally dubious premise .  however ,  it fails abysmally in the important areas .   there is thin and nonsensical plot line involving gordon sinclair's generous friend who may or may not be entwined in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics to third world countries - possibly in free computers  .  .  .  or possibly not .  vague ,  long-winded and inconclusive .  the lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical .  the film feels half-finished .   suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher  ( maria doyle kennedy )  can be drawn to gordon sinclair's unimpressive character ,  especially when he fends off her advances .  laughable .  it worsens later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value .   not many films leave me feeling cheated ,  but i felt my time was stolen . 
i'll say one thing about this film :  there are no lulls .  you can't get bored watching this .  the problem is that it is too intense .  there is too much action and it needs lulls !  that is the risk you take in modern action films .  you want it interesting but not overdone .  this is way overdone .   even though the acting is fine and features a couple of  " names "  in gary busey and roy scheider ,  it still has the feel of a  " b "  film .  the best part of it is scheider's dialog :  the only  " a "  part of this  " b "  film .   the rest of the story is strictly rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes .  one in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines .  that was memorable .  not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long . 
joseph brady and clarence doolittle are two sailors ,  who have a four-day shore leave in hollywood . joe knows everything about girls and can't wait to see lola ,  while clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls . they then run into a little boy ,  donald martin ,  who has ran away in order to join the navy . they take him home and meet his beautiful aunt susan ,  who wants to be a singer . clarence wants susie to be his girl ,  but his shyness gets in the way . but he doesn't feel shy with a waitress ,  who comes from brooklyn ,  like he does . soon joe notices he's in love with susie . the boys are in a fix when they lie to susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don't even know . as they are in a fix with their feelings . george sidney's anchors aweigh  ( 1945 )  is a great musical comedy . gene kelly is top-notch ,  once again ,  in his singing and dancing routines . frank sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from brooklyn . shy isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of frank sinatra ,  but he plays his part well . kathryn grayson is fantastic as susan abbott . we sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88 . the 9-year old dean stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor . jose iturbi does great job performing himself . it's magic what he does with the piano . edgar kennedy plays chief of police station . sara berner is the voice of jerry mouse . there's a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers . just look at kelly and sinatra performing  " we hate to leave "  . it's so energetic .  " if you knew susie  ( like i know susie )  "  is quite funny . it's a nice moment when frank sings brahms' lullaby to little dean stockwell . it's lovely to listen to grayson singing the tango  " jealousy "   . the most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world ,  and there gene sings and dances with jerry mouse . also tom cat is seen there as the butler . they originally asked mickey mouse but he refused . the movie was nominated for five oscars but georgie stoll got one for original music score . anchors aweigh is some high class entertainment . 
råzone is an awful movie !  it is so simple .  it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life .  just like zappa did many years ago .  but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors .  leon are by many still the little girl in  " krummernes jul "  ,  and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role .  several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie !   even though i consider it a movie you ought to see .  i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this ,  but i think it can show how it can end ,  if you are letting your child down .  also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like  " film folket "  !   all in all i think people should see råzone .  not because it is a great film ,  but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes .  i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it ,  and actually it is in these scenes ,  laura is acting best .  - like the ending where she is holding the gun ! 
 " foxes "  is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s .  and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it  ( porky's ,  fast times at ridgement high )  ,  the movie holds up well against time .   its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio  ( remember him ?  )  lead a fine young cast that's well worth watching .   the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents .  the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties ,  concerts ,  or out on the street .  seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill ,  party ,  or boy away .   but rather than condemning them ,  the film is sympathetic ,  blaming absent ,  uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone .  and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike .   the film's opening  a long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows .  we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood ,  from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola ,  while donna summer's  " on the radio "  is scored beneath .   from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life .  annie  ( runaway rocker cherie currie )  is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill .  deirdre  ( kandice stroh )  is the boy crazy drama queen .  madge  ( marlilyn stroh )  is the shy girl in over her head .  and foster is the one with the plan .  it's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line  ( sally kellerman )  .   it's an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails at .   despite its age ,   " foxes "  remains a pleasure to watch .  dated hair ,  clothes ,  and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill haven't hurt the movie .   the cinematography is simply stunning ,  with breathtaking filtered shots of the l . a .  basin at dawn ,  dusk and at night .  giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ian .   perhaps the movie's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of  " st .  elmo's fire "   ( 1985 )  or  " empire records "   ( 1995 )  .   " foxes "  shows why they should have .  but perhaps like bowling for soup's song  " 1985 ,  "  they just hit a wall . 
the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler's grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe .    clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the  " allied bias "  turning out to be historical fact .  the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east .  the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds .    the disparity between hitler's military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag ,  declaring  " peace in our time "  to this day has durable propaganda qualities .  here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options ,  freedom or slavery .  in 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively . 
i had never seen a silent movie until july 24 ,  2005 .  i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it .  i've seen thousands of movies .  very few are hypnotic to me .  i found last of the mohicans and unforgettable  ( ray liotta )  to be hypnotic ,  so consider the source as you read this .  i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was ,  who has been credited by many for launching hollywood .  i had no idea what i was in for .  two hours later ,  i snapped out of it ,  and realized i'd watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen ,  playing a role perfectly suited to her .  imagine a movie fan in 1922 ,  having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before .  you would have to see her again and again .  the setting was perfect for a girl that expressive .  she was a poor squatter ,  couldn't speak the king's english ,  but you had to admire her .  what a movie .  .  .  time to start my mary pickford movie collection ! 
unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid 7 euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie .  my points ;   film is based on 2 things ;   1 )  ethnical point of view :  as it happens on most of the american films ,  the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the asian culture .  but unfortunately it is not enough .  knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn't make a person understand a culture .  for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that .  lebanese people are christian  ( ok they got that )  and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries .  the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don't make ethnocentrism .  so we don't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film .    2 )  sexual revolution of a girl :  there is nothing much to say about this .  show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong .   i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre .  please watch dr . strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor .  a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it .  where is the truth ?  where is the meaning about the movie . 
the original  " les visiteurs "  was original ,  hilarious ,  interesting ,  balanced and near perfect .  lv2 must be a candidate for  " worst first sequel to a really good film "  .  in lv2 everyone keeps shouting ,  when a gag doesn't work first it's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny .  lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1 ,  except of course that a parody should be inventive .  if you loved lv1 just don't see this film ,  just see lv1 again !  ! 
as much as i like big epic pictures - i'll spare you the namedropping - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes .  films where the plot takes a backseat to the set-pieces .  films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose .  there are hundreds of films that fit the bill .  .  .  but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones .   it's an update of the movie that shares its name .  it also shares that picture's ethos ,  but not quite it's execution .  whatever was great about the original has been streamlined .  whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget .  often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster - see the pug-ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it - but here ,  thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors ,  sixty succeeds .   the plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write imdb about .  often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors ,  each of whom will voice it with different inflections .  a lot of people found this annoying ;  i find it raises a smile .  each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here ,  with cage ,  jolie and duvall leading the pack of course  ( and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here )  .  the chemistry between good ol' saint nick the stalwart  ( see date of review )  and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments .   the villain is not even a little scary - i've seen chris eccleston play tough-guy roles before so i know he can handle them ,  but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action .  we know the heroes are going to succeed ,  somehow ;  we're just sitting in the car with them ,  enjoying the ride .  i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in-cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating .  in fact ,  i wouldn't have minded some fourth-wall breaking winks at the camera :  it's just that kind of movie .   all this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed *just* so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there .  and for the most part ,  it is .  wonderfully so .  i've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast-cut extreme close-up shots to direct action these days .  i personally find this kind of thing exhausting .  i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time .  i've been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance  ( in real life i mean - his character clearly doesn't care )  and it shows .  the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow-burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish - and fun - way possible .   so yes ,  this movie isn't an  " epic ,  life-affirming post-9/11 picture with obligatory social commentary "  effort .  the pacing is uneven ,  some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line .  but car movies rarely come better than this .  so if you hate cars .  .  .  why are you even reading these comments ?  !   i'd take it over the numerous iterations of  " the flaccid and the tedious "   ( guess the franchise )  any day .  7/10
ok .  i know that the wanna-be john hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat ,  so the expectations for this film ran pretty low .   still ,  after sitting through this crap there's one key thing i can't seem to get out of my head :   i just sat through an 80s rob lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them .   the acting is awful ,  the characters boring and flat ,  the portrayal of oxford an absolute insult ,  and the rowing scenes unexciting ,  uneventful ,  and inaccurate .   unless you've got some wierd ally sheedy or amanda pays  ( or i guess ,  rob lowe )  fetish ,  there's really no reason to see this one . 
omen iv :  the awakening starts at the 'st .  frances orphanage' where husband & wife karen  ( faye grant )  & gene york  ( michael woods )  are given a baby girl by sister yvonne  ( megan leitch )  who they have adopted ,  they name her delia .  at first things go well but as the years pass & delia  ( asia vieria )  grows up karen becomes suspicious of her as death & disaster follows her ,  karen is convinced that she is evil itself .  karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next antichrist & gets a shock when she finds out who delia's real father was .  .  .   originally to be directed by dominique othenin-girard who either quit or was sacked & was replaced by jorge montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone's guess as omen iv :  the awakening is absolutely terrible & a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors .  the script by brian taggert is hilariously bad ,  i'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that i find even that hard to believe .  as a serious film omen iv :  the awakening falls flat on it's face & it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof ,  i mean the scene towards the end when the detective comes face-to-face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous gothic song has to be seen to be believed & i thought it was absolutely hilarious & ridiculous in equal measure .  then there's the pointless difference between this & the other omen films in that this time it's a young girl ,  the question i ask here is why ?  seriously ,  why ?  there's no reason at all & isn't used to any effect at all anyway .  then of course there's the stupid twist at the end which claims delia has been keeping her brother's embryo inside herself & that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of satan worshippers it has been implanted in karen so she can give birth to the antichrist is moronic & comes across as just plain daft .  at first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later .   it's obviously impossible to know how much of omen iv :  the awakening was directed by girard & montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it's a shabby ,  cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made-for-tv & it shows with the bland ,  flat & unimaginative cinematography & production design .  then there's the total lack of scares ,  atmosphere ,  tension & gore which are the main elements that made the previous omen films so effective .   the budget must have been pretty low & the film looks like it was .  the best most stylish thing about omen iv :  the awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything .  i have to mention the music which sounds awful ,  more suited to a comedy & is very inappropriate sounding .  the acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys .   omen iv :  the awakening is rubbish ,  it's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious & just ends up coming across as stupid .  the change of director's probably didn't help either ,  that's still not a excuse though .  the last omen film to date following the original the omen  ( 1976 )  ,  damien :  omen ii  ( 1978 )  & the final conflict  ( 1981 )  all of which are far superior to this . 
i always look forward to this movie when its on tv .  have to get the dvd i guess .  the range of different types of people is great .  it says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough .  my favorite character must be mr . aoki .  he is so quirky but so full of emotions .  it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing .  unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool .  would make for the perfect sequel if they had .  but i guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened .   a very simple and innocent story .  he stays loyal to his wife and daughter .   i haven't seen the hollywood remake .  not sure if i want to .  i don't really enjoy jennifer lopez .  i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez .  i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent . 
after all ,  you do not go to an orson welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy-ever-after star  you go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings ,  lighted and scored imaginatively ,  photographed bravely ,  and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place   as usual ,  as well as directing ,  welles wrote the script and he also played the hero  a young irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil ,  but still retained his clear-eyed trust in the goodness of others unfortunately for him ,  he reposed this trust in rita hayworth ,  whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future she was married without love ,  to an impotent ,  crippled advocate ,  acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant everett sloane   there is a youthful romanticism underlying it all ,  and this quality came into exuberant play in  " the lady from shanghai .  "  before the inevitable happened ,  welles escaped  to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors ,  which has become one of the classic scenes of the post-war cinema    welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere his camera seemed almost to caress rita hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web
terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome .  here ,  he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea .   rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman .  naturally ,  it's the woman below the sea .  her room mate ,  lainie kazan ,  soon winds up dead on the floor .   an aging richard conte plays a police officer and friend of rome .  when a local club owner gets killed ,  the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene .  that's how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action .   raquel welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue .  her acting leads a lot to be desired .    martin gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him .   by the film's end ,  you don't know why the girl was murdered .  don't even bother to ask . 
abhay deol's second film ,  written by imtiaz ali ,  maiden directorial effort by shivam nair .  soha probably has her first  (  ?  )  meaty role as megha ,  a girl who has run away from home and is waiting at the delhi marriage registrar's office for her boyfriend dheeraj  ( shayan munshi )  to meet her .  she waits and waits and finally is spotted as a damsel in distress by ankush  ( abhay deol )  .  they spend many days together as he extricates her from one distressing situation after another and finally falls in love with her .  then the boyfriend returns !  aage pardey par dekhiye !  sound familiar ?  this is yet another adaptation of dostoyevsky's white nights with a tiny bit of borrowing from le notti bianchi  ( very tiny though - ankush keeps the lovers apart by telling the boyfriend she is dead !  )  .  but this is an earthier and more realistic  ( duh )  adaptation than the much hyped and overblown saawariya .  i wonder why no one brought this little gem up when we were all discussing saawariya like crazy a few months ago .   the delhi settings are wonderful - there is the obligatory run through old delhi ,  shots of jama masjid from a roof top ,  connaught circus ,  streets with rickshaws  ( what ?  how ?  )  .  the colorful light fixtures in the hotel are enough to tell you this is a seedy joint with rooms for hire by the hour !    the more i see of abhay the more i like this young man .  in this second film he is quite good as the for hire witness who is given a purpose in life by a beautiful woman .  soha looks beautiful ,  and when she smiles she fits the role ,  but i found her unconvincing in the more serious moments .  i am not quite sure that she has it in her to be a great actress ,  or maybe she will blossom late like the brother .  the music by himesh reshammiya is not that great and in fact the movie falters at the songs ,  they kind of interrupt the narrative and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them .  the supporting cast is excellent and i give this white nights adaptation a thumbs up .  btw - the fact that i love abhay deol's cute dimples has nothing to do with my rating . 
this movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble .  when the director goes on vacation ,  his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things .   this is positively the best work that leslie nielson has ever done .  his idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative ,  and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh .   the little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that i know i will never forget her .  just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie !    such great family entertainment is so rare these days .  if you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings , go for this one !  i could watch this over and over ,  and i often do !  my only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy . 
in 1993 ,  with the success of the first season of batman :  the animated series ,  warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie ,  originally slated for direct-to-video ,  but bumped up to theatrical status .  it would become known as batman :  mask of the phantasm .  ten years after phantasm ,  we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the wb ,  sub-zero ,  return of the joker ,  and now ,  mystery of the batwoman joins the family .   the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm :  a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin .  now ,  batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line .   the animation is the sleeker ,  futuristic style that was utilized for batman :  the animated series' fifth and sixth seasons  ( aka the new batman adventures )  .   ,  it's quite nicely done ,  and just as sleek as return of the joker's animation .  there is also some use of cgi ,  but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub-zero .  the music was alright .  different and exotic and similar to the justice league score ,  although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts .   kevin conroy ,  as always ,  does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman .  it's also great to have the old batman :  the animated series alumni back ;  that includes bob hastings  ( commissioner gordon )  ,  robert costanzo  ( detective bullock )  ,  tara strong  ( barbara gordon/batgirl ;  her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond )  ,  and efrem zimbalist jr .  ( alfred )  .   villains were also great - especially given that rupert thorne ,  the old mob boss from the original series ,  appears for the first time since the fourth season .   overall ,  while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago ,  motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films .  and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan ,  you will love the five-minute short chase me . 
just a warning .  .  .  this is the worst movie i have seen in years .  .  .  i couldn't watch it to the end .  .  .  it is a pure waste of time .  .  .  i really feel sorry for snipes that he ended up in such a movie .  there really is not much to say about it .  horrible acting ,  incredibly bad lines ,  story ,  everything .  the only reason i would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be .  just to tell you one scene :  the police are searching for snipes ,  and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars ,  they are shooting around inside the building ,  but still they are whispering so that snipes doesn't suspect a thing . 
once i watched the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie .  it uses many of the tropes of the genre :  the sinister apartment ,  suspicious neighbors ,  apparitions ,  mysteries ,  hallucinations .  the life of the hero ,  trelkovsky ,  seemed surrounded by evil ,  secret forces trying to drive him mad .   last time i watched it i challenged this initial interpretation .  if this movie is a horror movie ,  it's only horror in the sense that a kafka novel is horror .  in fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence .   polanski made in his career three movies dealing with madness :  repulsion ,  which i don't particularly like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me ;  rosemary's baby ,  in which the heroine is driven mad by evil forces ;  and the tenant ,  which might be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema .   trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman killed herself .  he becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her :  he wears her clothes ,  puts on makeup ,  talks like her .  but is he being possessed by a spirit ,  or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him ?  it's this hesitation between what is real and imaginary ,  and which polanski never resolves ,  that makes this such a fascinating movie .  many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be to normal causes ,  and it's up to the viewer to decide what to believe in .   although this is not my favorite polanski movie ,  it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms .  and technically speaking ,  it's a marvel too .  suffice to say he collaborates with film composer philippe sarde and legendary director of photography sven nykvist  ( bergman's dp )  in the making of this movie .  a slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy ,  but it's an experience nevertheless . 
i found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content .  my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing anything .   when holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught ,  it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly .  it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked ,  preventing the servants from getting in .   the thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute .  i have no clue what this was supposed to represent . 
after having watched koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it ,  i finally had a chance to see it's sequel life in transformation .  i was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first .  90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie .  the philip glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first .  compared with koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless .  a watered down version of baraka ,  which is the same idea but done better .  i truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste . 
in the early to mid 1970's ,  clifford irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of howard hughes , claiming to have spent months preparing for the book , engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire .  when all of this turned out to be false , irving was accused of perjury & spent several years behind bars  ( although always admitting his findings were accurate )  .  flash forward to 20001 , several months prior to september 11th ,  a book , entitled 'forbidden love'  ( published in the u . s .  as 'honor lost : love and death in modern day jordan' )  by a previously unknown author by the name of norma khouri , a woman from jordan , who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend dalia , due to the fact that dalia , being from a devout muslim background , was dating a christian man .  it , like irving's biography on hughes was revealed as a potential hoax .  australian film maker , anna broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was khouri's attempts to clear herself of the lie ( s )  .  over the time frame of 104 minutes , the film attempts to reveal is norma khouri telling the truth , or is she just a compulsive liar , with an agenda/vendetta of her own ?  .  interview footage with those who know/knew her  ( including an ex husband , her publisher , and others )  tell their side of the story .  this is a toothsome , well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties .  not rated , but contains pervasive bad language & a re-enactment of the grisly murder scene , played over a few times  ( but nothing nearly as graphic & disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic , such as saw : part 84 )  .  not a good choice for the little ones . 
this movie was beautiful .  it was full of memorable imagery ,  good acting ,  and touching subject matter .  it would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental ,  but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve .  i was totally involved in the story's unfolding and presentation .  there were a few cheesy shots ,  but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film .  the only complaint i can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details .  however ,  this movie wasn't created to explain every element of joseph smith's life ,  ministry ,  triumphs ,  controversies ,  failures etc .  ;  it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figures of all time . 
the problem i find with this title is that i am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie .  a blend of the two genres just doesn't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere .  this is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary .  if it is meant to be a thriller/drama this is too dull and monotonous .  in either case ,  what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience ?  that around us there are people who ill-treat others who are willing to be ill-treated ?  that there are many crazy lunatics around us ?  so .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . so what ? 
summer phoenix did a great performance where you really feel what she's not able to feel and you just cannot understand what she has on her mind .  besides ,  she portrays a jewish girl who behaves really confronting the status quo of that century . 
the characters are cliched and predictable ,  with everyone being either snow-white pure or wholly evil .  the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing ,  over-the-top way .  it's doubly disappointing if you're a bette davis fan ,  because her character is not a typically fun bette-davis-type character ;  she just gets to frown pensively a lot .   on the whole ,  neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting ,  moving or enjoyable at all . 
what an ambitious project kenneth branagh undertook here and how well it was realized !  this is the first filmed version of 'hamlet' to use the full text of shakespeare's play ,  but branagh didn't do it just because  " it was there .  "  his intention ,  i believe ,  was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down ,  so to speak .  in return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves ,  a fair enough proposition and one that's a bargain .   the setting is a generic 19th century european one and this does more than work well ,  it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself .  the production design and cinematography and both outstanding ,  which helps immensely when you're watching a four-hour movie .  branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise .  the direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play .  since so much of 'hamlet' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels ,  battles ,  etc .  ,  this can be a daunting task .  but everything branagh tries to do seems to work .   branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor/writer/directors ,  if not always the best ,  since he made his big splash with 'henry v . ' one quibble i had with him was what i saw as a tendency to ham it up at times .  in his portrayal of hamlet here he might be accused of that again ,  but there is a method at work .  let's face it ,  'hamlet' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before ,  he or she needs help even if they've read the play .  hamlet has the most lines of any shakespearian character and branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film ,  even if you don't know the literal meaning of every arcane word .  this performance by branagh was at the very least worthy of an oscar nomination .   there are so many other outstanding performances here they're almost too numerous to mention ,  but some of them must be acknowledged .  derek jacobi as claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to kate winslet when it comes to handing out praise .  her portrayal of ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling ,  made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time !  she looks to me like the finest young actress around .  other super performers in no particular order are richard briers ,  nicholas farrell ,  michael maloney ,  and reece dinsdale and timothy spall as guildenstern and rosencrantz ,  respectively .  honorable mention goes to julie christie ,  charlton heston ,  and robin williams ,  who manages to do his thing here successfully .  even billy crystal as a gravedigger works .  the one cast member who doesn't ,  inexplicably ,  is jack lemmon .  in the very opening scene he appears ,  and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood ,  lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor .  you know this must have been a real dilemma for branagh ,  since everything else about the movies screams out that it's the work of a perfectionist .   not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie ,  but it does seem just a tad too long .  some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit ,  if i may be so bold ,  and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome .   did i forget anything ,  other than patrick doyle's score ?  no doubt i did .  i'll just sum up by saying that kenneth branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'hamlet , ' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one . 
everyday we can watch a great number of film ,  soap .  .  .  on tv .  sometimes a miracle happens .  a great film ,  with real feelings ,  with great actors ,  with a great realisator-director .  for me there are two films that everyone needs to see  :  the first is the pacula  ?   " sophie 's choice "  with meryl streep .  the second is  " journey of hope "  .  as human beings ,  we need to learn about humility ,  about love of the others ,  about acceptation of other civilisation ,  other way of living .  we also have to struggle against racism and fascim .  we must avoid judging ,  criticize ;  we only have to love our earth companion .  this wonderful film ,  helps us reaching john  ( lennon )  his dream  :  imagine all the people living live in peace .  these two films are difficult to see  :  watch these ,  but sure you will be hurt ,  but better .  great film ,  great actors ,  terrible story ,  pain and cry guarantee ,  but also better understanding of the others .  enjoy it . 
i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with .  in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia ,  the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains ,  the sinister darth vadar .  in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen .  he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat .  return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time .   when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse .  vadar it seemed had won the day .  how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow ?  in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han's daring rescue from jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father's soul .   old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself  (  played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud . how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery .  )  desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar . all in black with his red eyes , ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold .  his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire's reign for good .    lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted .  we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks  (  who i really do not believe take from the movie at all .  in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star )  and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers .  we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all .  and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back .   but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar .  for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings .  vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke .  never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on vadar's face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke .  there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain ,  especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible .  he is conflicted .  the apprentice as much as the master .  the victim as much as the villain .  without ruining the end too much vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy .   so in conclusion what can i say .  george lucas is the master of the saga .  star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it .  return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves .  it's action ,  suspense ,  romance ,  tragedy ,  redemption ,  joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters ,  wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of . 
i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloween/the fog/christine/the thing - probably his best films .   then you got this pos .  i can't logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns .  at least his son made a decent soundtrack .   you have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn't seem like a movie .  it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing .  i won't believe carpenter put any effort into this at all .   i was just listening to his old school h2/h3/the fog soundtrack and it was awesome ,  especially for the times .   he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films . 
for me every piece of art is to be judged by these criteria :  form ,  function and meaning .  guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms :  nice shots and sometimes interesting acting .  the long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself .  because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz .  an introvert person suggests to have depth ,  but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say .  this film acts like an introvert person .  if you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide  ( and the unanswered question why ?  )  that changes anna's view on life and makes her suspicious .  'why don't you speak to me ? ' asks sebastiaan .  anna doesn't answer ,  she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word .  what is the function of that shot ?  what does it mean ?  my question is like sebastiaans :  what has this film to say ?  what is meant by this movie ?  the answer for me :  it shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water .  the story of their lives is simple and boring .  motives behind their actions are not shown .  the rest is :  skins ,  residences ,  landscapes .  nice and artistic done ,  but meaningless without having disposal of 'instructions for use' .  in my opinion this film is made for fellow artists ,  not for the common viewer . 
i was thinking that the main character ,  the astronaut with the bad case of the runs ( in his case ,  his skin ,  hair ,  muscles ,  etc )  could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle .  all he has to do is get a job as the blob .  the premise of this flick is pretty lame .  an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation ( i think )  ,  and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day .  not only is this a puzzler ,  but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity .  huh ?  have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens ,  the person instantly turns into a killing machine ?  why is that ?   the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the 'secret facility' ( which has no security whatsoever )  ,  shedding parts of himself as he goes .  apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad ,  maybe because he wanted to return to space .    thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler ,  with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter ,  trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off .  he kills a stupid bill gates look-alike fisherman ,  scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie ,  and finishes off a wacky older couple ( punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons )  .  then there's a short scene where he whacks his former general ,  and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around .  you'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away ,  the scene would shift .  but no .  .  . we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror ,  even though the monster is gone .  all i could think was .  . director's girlfriend ,  anyone ?   the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it .  the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo ,  and then .  .  . nothing .  that's it .  that's the end of the movie .  well ,  at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel . 
i think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons i have ever watched .  i would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5 .  i did used to like this show when i was 4 and 5 ,  i still only watched it when there was nothing on .  now i am other 5 and i would rather do my homework than watch it .  the cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing .  now i am older i am interested in show witch are not rated us .  i have started to watch doctor who  ( 12a )  ,  torchwood  ( 15 )  and sarah jane adventures  ( pg )  .  i am interested in things to do with doctor who so i am not interested in 5 year old cartoons .  this cartoon didn't last very long it only had 6 seasons ,  it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons . 
this is one of the worst films i've seen .  the only positive thing i can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical .  first off ,  there's no plot .  the actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things .  such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends .  also the zombies were terrible ,  no where near as fun as any of romero's work ,  who gets s plug in the movie .  and the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences .  like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies .  also ,  all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun .  and the way the people die is so stupid .  it's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on .  and when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open ,  so dumb .   final verdict :  if any of these actors appear in another film ,  then they've been blessed with a second chance .  definitely the worst film i've seen in years .  a b-movie on cinemax is better . 
now either you like mr carrey's humour or you don't .  me ,  myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and ,  on the other hand ,  cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth .  bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream ,  but you have been warned .   if you're not sure ,  watch the trailer .  i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film .  if you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny ,  don't bother with the movie .   carrey ,  a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot .  god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better .  carrey gets into the swing of having all of god's powers by making his girlfriend  ( jennifer aniston ) 's breasts bigger ,  getting himself promoted ,  and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands .   this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable ,  but it is very well made within it's very limited intent ,  provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans ,  and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders .   on the more thoughtful level ,  the film tempts us to speculate about carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes .  his most accomplished 'straight' role ,  the man on the moon ,  is less well known that his comedy romps - or the truman show  ( on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey )  . 
i absolutely loved this movie .  it met all expectations and went beyond that .  i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn't just randomly silly .  it also had a message .  jim carrey makes me happy .   :  ) 
why did i waste 1 . 5 hours of my life watching this ?  why was this film even made ?  why am i even commenting on this film ?   one reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was n't for everybody .  i cannot figure out who this movie is for .  maybe after dropping a hit of acid ,  somebody ,  somewhere could watch this and make some sense out of it .  it is incoherent ,  it isn't experimental ,  it's plain and simple garbage .  the film follows no plot line whatsoever ,  just when you think you have something ,  well .  .  .  .  . you don't .    i think the ending brought some finality to the film  ( no pun intended )  ,  the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on .  i don't think i put a spoiler in here ,  not that it would matter .  this film is another must miss in the world of filmdom . 
this is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the btk killer .  the events in this movie are not even close to the truth .  why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce .  don't even waste your time watching this for free .  low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of ,  which is really what this movie did .  if they would allow me to give a -10 to this movie i would .  the acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old vhs video camera from the 80s .  save your time and money by not watching this movie . 
this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing .  it relies on the typical american thriller plot -  " who is going to outsmart everyone "  .  acting is below average ,  but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises .  film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material .  all in all ,  if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project ,  this is a film to watch .  i guess that would be enough to say on this film ,  everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough . 
almost golden :  the jessica savitch story  aspect ratio :  1 . 33 : 1  sound format :  stereo  bland ,  soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of america's first female tv news anchor .  with a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster ,  but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort .  a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go .  typically strong production values in the tv movie conveyor-belt manner ,  but it's all as superficial as old fluff ,  and just as engaging . 
i rented this some years ago ,  the video store had only vhs at the time .  straight to video was hitting it's strides  ( you know ,  where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films )  . i didn't know what to expect other than what was printed .  first thing i thought while watching was  " what the hells' wrong with the sound ?  " -obviously there was no dialogue dubbing .  words echoed ,  so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attention-mind you there's no shakespeare here !  , just simple talk .  the story is simple enough ,  boy meets girl etc .  .  what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was ,  the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story , but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs ( uniforms included )  .  all the while ,  you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after , then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor ( people hurting their privates , using vulgarities this couldn't have hurt the marketing .  there was something honest about it .  i thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better ,  which i'm sure they considered daily , but ,  they went ahead and made it .  this ,  i felt ,  was what independent film-making is all about . the word  " indy "  ,  is thrown around as if it's a genre .  . ha !  .  . that's funny ! 
joyce reynolds seems a might grown-up for the role of janie ,  a boy-crazy sixteen-year old in small town america who ditches her steady guy for a visiting soldier and winds up on the cover of life magazine  ( smooching at a blanket party )  all in the same week !  non-stop barrage of wisecracks ,  put-downs ,  bull talk ,  and unfunny bits of business such as janie's little sister bribing family members ,  hattie mcdaniel  ( as the maid )  constantly scuttling after sassy kid sis ,  janie's mother involved with the red cross ,  and janie's father trying to write an editorial on the problems with today's teenagers  ( as the parents ,  stuffy ,  sexless edward arnold and pert ,  chatty ann harding make an unlikely couple ,  even for 1944 ;  he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less raising two of them )  .  nominated for an academy award  (  !  )  for owen marks' editing ,  warner bros .  followed this in 1946 with  " janie gets married "  .  reynolds must have outgrown her co-horts by then--she was replaced by joan leslie .  *1/2 from ****
it's obvious that the people who made 'dead at the box office' love b-movie horror .  overt references to the genre are peppered throughout ,  from stock characters  ( the authority figure who doesn't believe the monstrous invasion is really happening )  to kevin smith style discussions to reenacting duane jones' last moments from 'night of the living dead' not once but twice .   unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie .   the staging and shot choice are unexciting and unimaginative .  while a common admonition in film school is to avoid 'mastershot theatre , ' telling the story completely in a wide master shot ,  here we find the obverse as in several sequences it's hard to figure out the spatial relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together .  editing is drab and basic and at times there are unmotivated cuts .  the lighting is flat and sometimes muddy ,  making the scenes in the darkened theatre hard to make out  ( was there lighting ,  or was this shot with available light only ?  )  .  some shots are out of focus .  the dialogue is trite ,  and the performances ,  for the most part ,  one-note  ( isaiah robinson shows some energy and screen presence as curtis ,  and the fellow playing the projectionist has some pleasantly dickish line readings ;  michael allen williams as the theater manager and casey kirkpatrick as enthusiastic film geek eric have some nice moments )  .  the premise is silly ,  even for a b horror flick  ( also ,  it's too bad dr eisner was unaware of project paperclip - he could've saved himself a lot of trouble !  )  .  the 'zombies' are non-threatening ,  and their makeup is unconvincing  ( although the chunky zombie trying to get a gumball out of the machine raised a smile )  .  for a zombie fan film ,  there is very little blood or violence ,  although what there is ,  is handled pretty well .  the incidental music ,  while stylistically uneven ,  is kind of nice at times ,  and there are some good foley effects .  the 'time warp' parody was a fun listen ,  although the images going along with it were less fun to watch .  unfortunately ,  the looped dialogue sounds flat .  was this shot non-sync  ( doubtful ,  it looks like video through and through )  ?  i watched the special introduction by troma films' lloyd kaufman before the main feature - although it consisted essentially of kaufman plugging his own stuff and admitting that he hadn't seen the movie while someone mugged in a toxie mask ,  its production and entertainment values were higher than 'dead .  .  . ' itself  ( quick aside to whoever put the dvd together - the countdown on film leader beeps only on the flash-frame 2 ,  not on every number plus one more after )  .  for that matter ,  the vampire film theatregoers are seen watching early in 'dead .  .  . ' looked a lot more entertaining than this .  recommendation to avoid ,  unless you know someone involved in the production or are an ardent lloyd kaufman completist  ( he plays 'kaufman the minion' in the film-within-a-film )  .    ( full disclosure :  my girlfriend is an extra in this movie .  i swear this did not color my review .  ) 
i don't know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess that's what reviews are ,  personal taste .  missed in this movie was the depth ,  a very deep film ,  many layers of emotion ,  affecting .  undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs ,  taboos of the times and classes ,  race relations not being in a very good state of equality ,  guilt ,  yearning ,  hate ,  confusion ,  very dark emotionally i thought ,  under the skin ,  you have to submit to the aire of it ,  a flowing movie ,  not slow as stated before ,  release yourself to the flow of the film ,  the emotions will show themselves ,  characters reveal their flaws ,  their nasty insides ,  excellent and actually very cruel ! 
 " a little nonsense now and then ,  is cherished by the wisest men .  "   if you are too smart to watch this movie ,  then you are too smart to be alive .    wonderful romp ,  wonderful premise ,  period piece done with acute eye for detail .   walter matthau ,  meg ryan ,  tim robbins - et al - just wonderful !   rent it ,  sit down ,  relax ,  take it in ,  smile a little .  enjoy yourself .    then ,  thank me . 
saw it yesterday night at the midnight slam of the festival des films du monde in montreal .  what a disappointment .  this movie is clearly over rated by imdb fans .  the acting was only but regular .  the directing didn't bring anything new or interesting .  the plot lacks considerably  :  the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls ( 7eventy 5ive )  .  and on top of that ,  you can predict the movie's end in the first five minutes .  if you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie ,  you might like it .  if you don't ,  this movie is not worth it . 
an average tv movie quality ,  totally formula story of religious fanatic  ( ron perlman ,  who gives good  " i'm not just the president of 'psychos r us , ' i'm also a client .  "  )  who gets control of a biochemical virus  ( think the virus from the movie  " the rock "  )  .  too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and the government agents trying to stop him  ( led by the impressively physiqued ,  mildly entertaining wolf larson ,  backed by fred dryer )  along with the standard  " in the wrong place at the wrong time "  spunky female  ( the forever bland erika eleniak )  and  " lived as a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute "  male  ( brandon karrer )  .  has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic  ( wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous )  .    basically a decent rainy day movie .   favorite line ,  spoken by ron perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in erika eleniak's cleavage :   " a woman and her mystery .  "   worth a rent . 
at last - i've finally got round to it and managed to see a  " clean "  copy of pakeezah !  up until now i've only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the '90's ,  with quirky english subtitles ,  dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own .  having thought the world of such a poor  ( and short )  copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possible .   this was the lovely meena kumari's film from start to finish ,  and i believe was planned by her from 1958 on ,  finally realising it in 1971 .  what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards ,  and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah ,  necessitating a body double .  in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face .   the story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it ,  but i'm led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india .  it's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message ,  an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too .  but to me it's the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar - especially thare rahiyo - and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding .  i've seldom heard such serious ,  beautiful ,  poetic ,  wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack .  singin' in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music - yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her .  the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here ,  albeit a classic duet with lata .    because of all this but not blind to its faults ,  pakeezah is my favourite indian movie ,  filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur .  at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian  " pop "  music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines ,  the bollywood beat and bhangra . 
the original movie  (  dated 19 ?  ?  ) did not show any  " monster "   ,  it just suggested scary  " things "   ,   .   this version however shows every aspect of a  " sick minded ghost "   ,  including unnecessary special effects  .    the  " mystery  "   , as presented in the original movie  ,  was the most scary part  :  one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened .  by showing the face of the  " old man "   ,  this mister has completely disappeared .  even worse  :  the special effects  (  crying wooden children faces )  is ridiculous .  this is a stupid remake  ,  too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original
 " i love new york "  is another entry by vh-1  ( mtv networks )  showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill ,  obnoxious ,  woman .  it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest ,  ebonics speaking ,  craziest contestant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network .  many will argue ,   " this is a show "  .  true ,  it's not as bad as it's previous show ,   " flavor of love "  - but it's just as bad .   it reminds me of a skit from the 90's show  " in living color "  where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on  " the love connection "  dating show and he picked  " robin givens "  for a date .  mike talked of how the date was okay ,  but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in .  this show reminds me of that .   the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more -  ( i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto ,  you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv .  )  but these are professional reality actors ,  so why bother .   it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this .  the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions ?  15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network ?   ( well ,  you can't hate them for trying to make a buck .  )  maybe the wonder is - who would want to be with this woman past an hour ?  or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on the wwf !  any way you slice it ,  it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil .   no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck ,  or any different from any of the others .  appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an  " end "  to reality shows ,  this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end ,  immediately . 
the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in space near out planet .  when it's retrieved ,  one of the crew members is ill ,  one is alive and the other two are missing .  what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member .   while on mars ,  the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug-eyed monsters .  oddly ,  while the sets were pretty good ,  the monsters were among the silliest i have seen on film .  plus ,  in an odd attempt at realism ,  the production used a process called  " cinemagic "  .  unfortunately ,  this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed--it was that bad !  !  despite all the cheese ,  the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel .  for lovers of the genre ,  it's well worth seeing .  for others ,  you may just find the whole thing rather silly--see for yourself and decide .   while by today's standards this isn't an especially good sci-fi film ,  compared with the films being made at the time ,  it stacks up pretty well .   ps--when you watch the film ,  pay careful attention to dr .  tremayne .  he looks like the spitting image of dr .  quest from the  " jonny quest "  cartoon !  plus ,  he sounds and acts a lot like him ,  too . 
i am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film .   often with foreign films i skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming  " absence of action "  as many of the best international films do not live up to the western hollywood model of cinematic storytelling .   i enjoy the frequent artfulness and lack of cliché in the foreign film arena .  i enjoy that many foreign films don't tie things up in a neat palatable little bow .   that said ,  this particular film offered no redemptive value for the time i wasted watching it .  no meaningful character development ,  no engaging story arc ,  no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen .    synopsis :  a bunch of emotionally immature uptight prejudiced colonials mistreat their slaves ,  and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the  " house-boy "  finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her .    while the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic ,  this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario .  i was so unengaged that it took three sittings to finish it ,  and i wouldn't have even done that were it not for the positive ratings .    unless you have an academic interest in the period i strongly suggest steering clear of this one . 
going into see seven pounds i wasn't clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about .  so within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot ,  have no idea what is going on and you think tim ,  who claims to be ben ,  is just a big asshole .  all of this comes to an end when the  " twist "  , so to speak ,  is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie .  basically tim  ( will smith )  was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives .  by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to .   the acting of this film is great ,  as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress .  rosario dawson ,  to me ,  this is one of her better movies ,  aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to .  she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film .  other actors ,  such as woody harrelson ,  have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character .  although the casting of the film was still good .   this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped .  the movie ,  however ,  was still pretty good .  nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place .  up until then it just seems like a pointless love story .  final thought seven pounds=seven stars . 
its spelled s-l-a-s-h-e-r-s .  i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs .  that was pretty tight .  before and after that the movie pretty much blows .  the acting is like e-list and it's shown well in the movie .  not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person .  the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film .  the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny .  they said many stupid things that made me laugh .  other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman 2 .  anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated . 
it was very heart-warming .  as an expatriated french ,  i particularly enjoyed this  " tv "  movie ,  which i think deserves a broader distribution .  the acting was good ,  and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed so  strong and so natural .  no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids .  one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son  ( leo )  ,  who has contracted hiv ,  and the youngest son  ( marcel )  ,  to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation .  the two characters  progressively explore each other as time runs out for leo ,  who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs .  .  . 
sorry .  someone has to say it .  this really is/was a dull movie .  worthy perhaps ,  but dull nonetheless .  i nearly cried with boredom when watching it .  the acting is pretty dire ,  the story drawn out and predictable ,  the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting .  it's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate  ( becase it is about disabled people )  but hate it i suspect nearly everyone does .  it is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie .  i suppose they too are not allowed to be objective .  this was made to win awards - which i remember it duly did .  but it was neither interesting nor entertaining .  i haven't seen the play so cannot compare . 
***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** after two so-so outings  (  " magnum force "  and  " the enforcer "  )  ,  dirty harry seems to have regained his stride in  " sudden impact ,  "  a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths :  the charisma of clint eastwood ,  who also directed ,  and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes .   for once ,  the case takes harry outside his native san francisco  ( where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his  " shoot first ,  ask questions later "  tactics )  ,  to the hamlet of san paulo .  there ,   ( warning :  potential spoiler )  a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered ,  one at a time ,  by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier ,  and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack .   the killer is portrayed by sondra locke ,  and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness .  locke's cold eyes and frosty voice ,  when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists ,  are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit .   the rapists are a despicable lot ,  especially the leader ,  who has  " psycho nutjob "  practically stamped on his forehead ,  and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys ,  despite her anatomical inability to participate .  the flashback scenes ,  while not graphically explicit ,  are nightmarish enough ,  and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her assailants .   some will dismiss  " sudden impact "  as trash :  a mindless ,  manipulative revenge tale .  on a certain level this is true ,  but it's well-done trash .  what works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance ,  giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech .  what we have here is an action movie with a point of view .   you can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary ,  but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to harry  ( a realization that ,  wisely ,  is not spelled out with dialogue )  ,  he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate .  this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare .   the movie's other redeeming quality is eastwood's direction .  this is ,  after all ,  a dirty harry movie ,  and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else .  the movie is directed with style and wit ,  and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff .  some of the best  " harry moments "  in the entire series are here ,  including harry's best-known line ,   " go ahead -- make my day .  "    " sudden impact "  is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow .  it is also a riveting detective story ,  well made and well told .  and it is certainly never dull .  on those criteria ,  it succeeds tremendously . 
best show since seinfeld .  she's really really funny .  her total self centeredness ,  the hulking gay stoner neighbors ,  the departures into song or cartoons ,  make this the freshest show on tv .  one of the few shows i make point of watching .  the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore  (  " oh wait now that you're close you do look old "  turns face with finger and walks away lol )  ,  the cough syrup overdose ,  sleeping with god ,  it's all so funny or so stupid it's just a lot of fun .  the shows weak points are her sister and the cop-only because they're too darn normal !  !  i really can't wait until the next show ,  something i haven't felt for any show in a long time . 
gandhi ,  the great  :   greatness in the world is associated with people like alexanader the great ,  ashoka the great for their greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans .  gandhi is called great for actually not being a great but being more human ,  for i always believe bringing out the humanity in us is where the greatness of being human lies . gandhi was a human with humanity and one who strived for humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not his enemies .  let me move to the movie review now .   about gandhi my father  :   gandhi my father is a film not about gandhi but about his son harilal gandhi . on telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to walk this earth ,  the director succeeds in portraying the tale . the film succeeds in telling the story of a mislead son of a father who lead a nation to greatness . the movie is termed as a criticism of gandhi's failure as a father to his son ,  i would rather say it is of a sacrifice gandhi had made as a father of a son to do justice as a father of a nation .   i wish the essence of this movie prevails not just in india ,  the gandhian land ,  but through the hearts of all the people of this world .   gandhi the true human .  jaihind . 
aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting ,  this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia .  i can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a  " good movie .  " 
what is this  ?  a low budget sex comedy  ?  anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain .  they could come up with a better idea ,  i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s .  .  and people like them  !  this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one  ( you can't let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing ,  he'll never want to go to spain )  .  this should be rated  " r "  ,  because only people 35+ seem to laugh watching  : s i'm truly disappointed ,  maybe i don't like gays  ( which is quite an important part of the movie )  .   foreign humor is awful in films  ( except kusturica )  ,  stick with doing dramas !  if you want a new comedy try talladega nights
i may have seen worse films than this ,  but i if i have ,  i don't remember .  or possibly blocked them out .  who knows , if i was to undergo hypnotherapy ,  i may remember them ,  along ,  maybe ,  with been abducted by aliens as a child ,  or other traumas .  if so ,  i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film .   i should give the film some credit :  it did produce an emotional response .  i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs ,  that this travesty was dirtying them by association .  i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye . 
the memory banks of most of the reviewers here must've short-circuited when trying to recall this cubic zirconia of a gem ,  because practically everyone managed to misquote lloyd bochner's walter thornton ,  when in a fit of peevish anger ,  he hurls the phallic garden nozzle at his new wife ,  jerilee randall-thornton ,   ( a nearly comatose pia zadora )  which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the movie .  .  . but i'm getting ahead of myself .  in any case ,  poor lloyd could've been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put-upon co-star .   hard as it is for most of us to believe ,  especially these days ,  nobody in hollywood sets out to intentionally make a bad movie .  this is certainly not the most defensible argument to make ,  since there just seem to be so damn many of them coming out .  but then again ,  there is that breed of film that one must imagine during the time of its creation ,  from writing ,  casting and direction ,  must've been cursed with the cinematic equivalent of trying to shoot during the ides of march .   the lonely lady is in that category ,  and represents itself very well ,  considering the circumstances .  here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen soufflé :  pia zadora ,  a marginal singer/actress so determined to be taken seriously ,  that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers ,   ( which this movie most certainly did !  )  ;  a somewhat high-profile novel written by the trashmaster himself ,  harold robbins  ( of the carpetbaggers and dreams die first fame )  ;  a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all ,  that they tried to play this dreck like it was clifford odets or ibsen ;  plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck ,   ( and was probably contractually obligated not to demand the use of the 'alan smithee' moniker to protect what was left of his reputation .  )  like lamont johnson's lipstick ,  meir zarchi's i spit on your grave ,  roger vadim's barbarella ,  paul verhoeven's showgirls or the grandmammy of really bad film-making ,  frank perry's mommy dearest ,  the lonely lady is still often-discussed ,   ( usually with disgust ,  disbelief ,  horrified laughter ,  or a unique combination of all three )  ,  yet also defies dissection ,  description or even the pretzel logic of hollyweird .  nobody's sure how it came to be ,  how it was ever released in even a single theater ,  or why it's still here and nearly impossible to get rid of ,  but take it or leave it ,  it is here to stay .  and i don't think that lovers of really good bad movies would have it any other way . 
i have to point out ,  before you read this review ,  that in no way ,  is this a statement against iranian people  .  .  .  if you really want to read something into it ,  than hopefully you see ,  that i'm against politicians in general  .  .  .  but if you're looking to be offended  .  .  .  i can't help you !   not in iran as this movie is banned there  ( see imdb trivia for this movie )  .  which is a shame ,  because the movie is great .  would it not be for  " grbavica "  ,  this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin .   rightfully so  ( it was the runner-up ,  or second place if you will )  .  why ?  because it is a movie about oppression .  it's not even that this is a complete women issue .  it is about the government trying to keep the people down .  an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie .  but by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear !    another reviewer had a great summary line :   " comedy about a tragedy "  ,  that sums it up pretty well ! 
the film as entertainment is very good and jimmy stewart is excellent as chip hardesty ,  with well done co-starring turns by vera miles and murray hamilton .  but the film ,  directed by legendary director mervyn leroy ,  was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film ,  down to clothing ,  was closely watched and controlled by j .  edgar hoover .  not that j .  edgar hoover didn't have something to be proud of .  his management of the bureau from 1924 to his death crated on of the finest investigative services in the world .  but by 1959 hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect dossiers on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom .  and he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau .  the films shows only continued successes and glosses over the failures which occurred ,  and the bureau's part in the witch hunts of the early 1950's .  enjoy the story ,  but with tongue firmly in cheek . 
bottom of the barrel ,  unimaginative ,  and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior .  this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far !  bad acting ,  dialog ,  effects ,  dubbing ,  pacing ,  action sequences .  .  .  the list goes on and on .  italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip-offs in the early 80's ,  some good ,  some bad .  this is the worst by far ,  no contest .  not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable ,  the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half .  there was 1  ( one )  good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie ,  and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding .  but everything else about this movie seriously reeks !  for actual post-nuke fun ,  go track down a copy of endgame ,  after the fall of new york ,  or escape from the bronx instead .  they're much more enjoyable than this rubbish . 
10 out of 10 ,  this brilliant ,  super documentary is a must see ,  with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years ,  untill this was screened in 1974 .  the film clips in this documentary from the war doesn't miss out anything ,  some of the clips left me dumbstuck .  the whole series is over 20 episodes long ,  and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war .  simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still ,  and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch .  you must watch this at some time ,  even if it's a few episodes ,  even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war ,  in a world at war .  . 
i liked this film a lot .  it's dark ,  it's not a bullet-dodging ,  car-chasing numb your brain action movie .  a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague ,  leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions .  it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds .   in the end ,  motivated by love or vengeance ,  or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is  " right "  .  'will god ever forgive us for what we've done ? ' - it's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do ,  what he's good at ,  what he's been trained to do .   denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done - and he's got a great supporting cast .  i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone . 
oh this was a really bad movie .  the girl who plays jennifer is ok ,  but i think she acts bitchy through the movie ,  not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night ,  but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap .  faye dunaway acts like she is remaking mommy dearest and the ending is completely silly .  i really can't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe ,  i was intrigued a bit by the references to his work ( ravens ,  house of usher-like family curse , and being buried alive ) -still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film . 
riding giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential big-wave surfers ,  gregg noll ,  jeff clark ,  and laird hamilton .  stacy peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job .  the structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration ,  interviews ,  animation and surfing footage .  the music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film ,  making riding giants brilliant viewing .  personal highlights include any of greg noll's comments ,  what with his straight-to-the-point frankness ,  laird hamilton's footage at teahupoo ,  and the out-takes at the end of the movie .  but really this entire film is one big ,  recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see .  it's a shame it isn't more well known ,  but it is a gem deserving of attention .  10/10
brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve .  rather incredibly ,  contra todos  ( against everybody )   ( original title ,  which the producers discarded :  god against everybody )  got very low gpa  ( grade point average )  in this website .  it seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large .  actually ,  it is not so brutal .  i mean as far as graphical violence is concerned .  its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would-be lumpens ,  i mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment ,  who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of  " grana graúda "  .  is this post-modern man ?  is his/her only worry a quick ,  almost impersonal ,  ultra permissive lay ,  amidst over satiating meals  ?  the picture is probably the best brazilian film of 2004 ,  so far .  its shining editing style ,  à la godard ,  its curious soundtrack counterpoints ,  its more than efficient overall cast and ,  above all ,  its original narration ,  with subtle non-chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue ,  deserve at least an 8 mark . 
how did mike hammer live - in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace ?  nah ,  he'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly-specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house ,  wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face ,  that's how .  spillane wrote trash paperbacks ,  for sure ,  but how do you make it worse ?  give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office ,  add some over-the-hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw-up the story-line by some retard ,  drugged out screen writer ,  that's how ! 
what ?  !  ?  ?  why are people saying this is  " mind blowing ?  "  just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography !  4 left and the whole world has ended !  not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed .  1 was right the whole time ,  if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened .  people giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what ?  .  .  .  to make it rain ?  i admit the movie had it's parts ,  and the whole concept was fascinating .  but a lot of it was clichés one after another .  and did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like  " lord of the rings ?  "  characters died for stupid reasons ,  there was almost no character development ,  and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world ;  its pointless and stupid .  it was one of the shortest movies i've ever seen ,  and thank god !  how is robots turning against humans creative in any way !  it's been done like a hundred times !  this movie is really stupid ,  go see a movie that's worth watching like star trek ,  the hangover ,  or inglorious basterds ,  those were good movies ! 
first off ,  the movie was not true to facts at all .  i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it .  first of all nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on .  also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it .  in my opinion russell crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type ,  therefore he really couldn't play one .  it would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics  ( similar to pi )  and not the over-dramatized lovelife .  at this level abm was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great .  personally i think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we  " lesser mortals "  .  5/10
as hard as it is for me to believe ,  with all of the awful reality shows out there over the past few years ,  this one has to take over the top spot for worst one yet .  i am still wondering if this was actually just a spoof done by the sctv gang .  if andy kaufmann were still alive i'd be sure he was behind this .  can a rock band stoop any lower than has inxs to do such a shameful thing as this ?  the premise is simple and moronic .  audition a bunch of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of inxs ,  to take the place of michael hutchence  ( who committed suicide in 1997 )  .  eight years and no hits later ,  the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime .  so they trot all of these awful singers  ( i thought american idol had its share of doozies )  who do atrocious renditions of just about every classic  ( and predictable )  rock song imaginable .  and then they cut to the inxs band members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates .  you could see better  ( and more original )  rock performers at just about any night club in any city in the world .   it has all the usual uncreative elements of every other reality show .  lame reality participants ,  lame interviews ,  lame host/emcee ,  lame  " judging "  of performances ,  and the lame booting of one participant at the end of each show .  can these shows get any more predictable ?  it's clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band ;  a last gasp of hope at rekindling their lost stardom before they are finally buried into oblivion .  michael hutchence ,  if he had any shred of dignity when alive ,  has to be rolling over in his grave .  not that inxs were ever a great band ,  but i had no idea they were this pathetic .  if inxs are at all representative of what rock and roll has become ,  this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all ,  dead . 
apart from having the longest reign in british history  ( 63 years )  ,  queen victoria also holds two other distinctions .  she was ,  apart from our current queen ,  the oldest ever british monarch ,  living to the age of 81 .  and she was also the youngest ever british  ( as opposed to english or scottish )  monarch ,  coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen .  and yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her ,  they seem far more interested in the older victoria than they do in the young girl ;  the version of victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is judi dench in  " mrs brown "  .   " the young victoria "  tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign .  it has the rare distinction of being produced by a former royal ,  sarah duchess of york ,  whose daughter princess beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra .   there are three main strands to the plot .  the first concerns the intrigues of victoria's mother ,  the duchess of kent ,  a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter ,  largely because of the influence of her adviser sir john conroy ,  who was widely rumoured to be her lover .   ( according to one unfounded rumour he ,  and not the late duke of kent ,  was victoria's natural father )  .  the second strand concerns the growing romance between victoria and her german cousin prince albert ,  and the attempts of king leopold of belgium ,  who was uncle to both of them ,  to influence this romance .   ( leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the house of saxe-coburg ,  to which both he and albert belonged )  .  the third concerns one of the strangest episodes in british political history ,  the bedchamber crisis of 1839 ,  when supporters of the tory party  ( which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy )  rioted because the young queen was perceived to favour the whig party and their leader lord melbourne ,  even though the whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government ,  with the monarch reduced to a figurehead .   scriptwriter julian fellowes is known for his conservative views ,  and at times i wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes ,  as he seems to lean to the side of the tories ,  the predecessors of the modern conservative party .  their leader robert peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified ,  whereas melbourne ,  for all his dash and charm ,  is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform .  there may be some truth is these characterisations ,  but fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the tories had opposed the reform act ,  which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs ,  and that they had benefited from william iv's unconstitutional dismissal of a whig administration .   lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen ,  and this one contains its share of inaccuracies .  prince albert ,  for example ,  was not injured in edward oxford's attempt on victoria's life ,  and melbourne  ( in his late fifties at the time of victoria's accession )  was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by paul bettany .  king william iv certainly disliked the duchess of kent  ( who was his sister-in-law )  ,  but i doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet ,  as he is shown doing here .  i also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the duchess and conroy try to force victoria to sign a  " regency order "  ;  the duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the regency act 1830 ,  which provided that she would become regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession .  no piece of paper signed by victoria could have altered the provisions of the act .   there are also occasional infelicities .  in one early scene we see victoria and albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard ,  a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a  " danger !  major cliché ahead !  "  warning .  yet in spite of scenes like this ,  i came to enjoy the film .  there were some good performances ,  especially from miranda richardson as the scheming duchess and mark strong as the obnoxious conroy .  it is visually very attractive ,  being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with british historical drama .  jim broadbent gives an amusing turn as king william ,  although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top .   ( although not as disastrously over the top as he was in  " moulin rouge "  )  .   the main reason for the film's success ,  however ,  is the performances of emily blunt and rupert friend as the two young lovers victoria and albert .  blunt is probably more attractive than victoria was in real life ,  but in her delightful portrayal the queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination ,  the black-clad widow of windsor who was perpetually not amused ,  but a determined ,  strong-minded and loving young woman .  her love for albert ,  and their happy family life together ,  was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the british people .   ( with the exception of george iii ,  victoria's hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues )  .  blunt and friend make  " the young victoria "  a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in british history .  8/10
 " the man in the moon "  is a pretty good movie .  it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects .  i wouldn't say the film was terribly original ,  but what is these days ?   the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles .  i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age ,  and does quite a good job .  jason london does a fine job as well .  and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston ,  who did a fantastic job with his role .  i really liked sam's character  ( matthew trant )  a lot .  at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread ,  but in the end you really like his character .  the rest of the cast was very good as well .   if you're into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you ,  then you ought to watch this film .  i'd suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you'd be interested in ,  then go for it .  anyhow ,  hope you enjoy the film ,  thanks for reading ,   -chris
i'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies i give a 1 to .  they are almost all movies that my wife made me watch .  maybe i should stop having faith in her taste in movies .  anyway ,  this is typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls but done even more poorly than usual .  once again ,  the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie .  he/she made the main character unlikable .  she starts off by being a complete b*tch to her friend at the beginning ,  and then finds out when she becomes 30 ,  that she's basically a sh*tty person  ( having affairs ,  etc .  )  .  why the f would we feel for this person ?  ok ,  let's say we can get past that .  jennifer garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity .  i don't know if it's her or the writer's fault ,  but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance .  here's a tip for future filmmakers :  13 year olds are not entertaining ,  they're annoying .  far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to  " thriller "  .  holy crap that was painful .  it showed her practicing that dance at the beginning .  that explains why she knows it ,  but an entire club full of people ?  !  ?  argh !  !  !  the macarena would be more believable !  all of a sudden she's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices ?  at least tom hanks' character on  " big "  had a job that made sense to a child .  these body-switching/child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand ,  and this is by far the worst one yet . 
it is quite a simple not very active but very charming film .  there were moments where i can see why cher won the academy award for best actress ,  but there were other times when i wondered why glenn close didn't win for fatal attraction .  anyway ,  oscar and golden globe winning ,  and bafta nominated cher plays loretta castorini ,  a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by mr .  johnny cammareri  ( danny aiello )  to marry him .  he promises her he'll be back in a month ,  as his mother is sick ,  so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible .  only problem is ,  when she finds johnny's one-handless brother ronny  ( golden globe nominated nicolas cage )  ,  they start having a relationship ,  and there love goes on to that moon scene  ( where the title comes from )  .  also starring oscar nominated vincent gardenia as cosmo castorini ,  oscar ,  bafta and golden globe winning olympia dukakis as rose castorini and john mahoney as perry .  it ends with no wedding for johnny and loretta ,  but she and ronny were happy together .  it won the oscar for best writing ,  screenplay written directly for the screen ,  and it was nominated for best director for norman jewison  ( in the heat of the night )  and best picture ,  it was nominated the baftas for best score for dick hyman and best original screenplay ,  and it was nominated the golden globes for best motion picture - comedy/musical and best screenplay .  it was number 96 on 100 years ,  100 quotes  (  " snap out of it !  "  )  ,  it was number 17 on 100 years ,  100 passions ,  and it was number 41 on 100 years ,  100 laughs .  very good ! 
can only be described as awful .  it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad .  when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but fear not because it does .  another poorly written script for a donkey director for no-talent offspring of past movie stars .  it's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both .  as for the hero - well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it .  and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete - doesn't even blink - then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies .  this is a really ridiculous movie .  lucky it only cost me $1 to hire . 
in 1925 ,  childhood friends marie dressler  ( as maggie warren )  and polly moran  ( as lizzie praskins )  oversee the wedding of their children ,  anita page  ( as helen )  and norman foster  ( as john )  .  before the celebration ,  ms .  dressler turns the reigns of her small town bank over to her son ,  mr .  foster .  six years later ,  the great depression brings many bank closures ,  and financial insecurity .  banker foster is able to survive ,  due to mother dressler's wise planning .  but ,  ms .  moran is worried about her fortune ,  and loudly demands a complete withdrawal .  other  " warren bank "  customers hear moran's rant ,  and start questioning their own solvency .  soon ,  the family is in financial crisis .   dressler's huge critical and financial film hit  " emma "  had been released early in the year ,  and mgm had to have wanted to get a new dressler film out as soon as possible .  dressler's 1931 hits ,   " reducing "  and  " politics "  were still making a lot of money ;  and ,  dressler had become 1932's us #1 box office star ,  according to the industry standard list compiled by quigley publications .   " prosperity "  certainly celebrated dressler's status ,  but the production appears uncharacteristically sloppy ,  and rushed .  the cast does well ,  considering .  some more care in direction and editing ,  and some retakes ,  would have helped apparently ,  they needed it in theaters for the holidays .   **** prosperity  ( 11/12/32 )  sam wood ~ marie dressler ,  polly moran ,  anita page ,  norman foster
the unflappable william powell .  he is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world .  he always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him .  the murders are projects ,  barely human beings .  i have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit .  other than an occasional weeping widow ,  the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists .  nothing more .  there are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and powell is a master at this .  there is a lot of political incorrectness ,  especially as it relates to the asian performers .  this is a little hard to take .  the cast is great ,  and curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset . 
this should be my kind of movie .  even if it sucked ,  it still should have been right up my alley ;  hell ,  i like  " congo ,  "  and  " allan quatermaine "  movies .  i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies .  let's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place .   1 .  horror/sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2 .  i'm a big fan of archaeology ,  and this movie does involve a rare treasure .  3 .  super-natural enemies with quality fx .  4 .  christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy .  5 .  tara reid is hot .   so this movie had potential ,  at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store ,  but boy did it suck ass .  the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf ,  and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do .  .  . i mean ,  let's face it ,  both are melodramatic .  but now on to some of the many faults .   tara reid .  even though the movie as a whole is worse ,  reid's performance is truly awful .  we're not just talking bad ,  i'm talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year .  i don't know if she is capable of acting ,  but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league .  .  . completely .  watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn .  i mean this isn't just bad ,  it is laughably bad .  oh ,  and for those of you curious ,  she doesn't get naked ,  only down to a bra in a silly ,  totally unnecessary love scene .   even with reid's performance ,  perhaps the movie could have worked ,  but the plot is what dominates ,  and the plot seems written by a 10 year old .  i hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd ,  otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time .    the storyline jumps back and forth from slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened ,  he has amnesia ,  of course .  in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713 ,  a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something .  slater had to leave because he was too rebellious ,  i guess ,  you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs i zoned out during .  the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts ,  obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a  " chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities .  "  i may have the exact quote wrong ,  but you get the idea .   there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth  ( no reason given )  ,  experiments on children ,  super demon/alien-human hybrids ,   " photonic "  bullets  ( the demon things can't stand sunlight )  and ,  of course ,  slater and dorf to try to save everyone .   jesus ,  i can't even being to wade through the clichéd elements .  the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth .  i mean ,  why is this evil scientist so damn evil ?  oh right ,  humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race .  i guess he's infected ?  how did that happen ?  oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself .  how the hell did that happen ?  why and where did he get the super slugs  ( oh yes ,  they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which  " fuse "  with the spine of their host ) of course ,  slater is ,  like blade ,  half super-slug powered ,  but his slug  " didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock ,  "  thank god .  oh ,  and the people with these  " fused "  spines ,  have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies .  yeah we get zombies .   so lots of crap that could be entertaining ,  but none of it is .   also ,  the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place .  .  . at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle .   not the very worst thing you'll see ,  but a truly bad movie . 
ok ,  my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about 30 minutes into the movie ,  we'd exchanged a lot of  " ehhh ,  what is this movie about and more importantly ,  do i care to find out what it ends with "  glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the  " plot "  or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else .  we opted for the latter .   i liked  " but i'm a cheerleader "  a lot ,  but mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste ,  sorry !  i definitely prefer  " d . e . b . s "  ,   " better than chocolate "  ,   " fucking åmål "  ,   " goldfish memory "  and  " fire "  .   -sorcia
while not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works ,  this slow-moving ,  repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half ,  but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement .   to be sure ,  the actors are above average - considering this is an argento movie - and some moments show the director's visual skills ,  but whole sequences should've been cut and ,  basically ,  it's just the same exploitative trash as ever ,  wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity .   3 out of 10 genetic disorders
there is good .  there is bad .  and then their is the sentinel ,  a bottom-barrel political  " thriller "  that ranks among the worst movies i have ever seen .  the plot of a mole in the secret service is a good one ,  but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered .  directed with ham-handed  " edginess "  by clark johnson ,  every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot .  even the great michael douglas looks bored here .  i can honestly say i have never ,  in all my life ,  viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes .  the twist is predictable from square one ,  and the character's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience .  avoid this at all costs .  this is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value . 
jim henson's muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood .  this film makes me feel like a kid again .  okay ,  the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends .  the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city .  you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch .  anyway ,  the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang .  the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city .  it's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself . 
a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town ,  leading to all kinds of complications .  cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town .  hopper does what he does best ,  playing a psycho known as  " lyle from dallas ,  "  the real hit man .  walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast .  the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns ,  and john's direction creates a terrific  " neo noir "  atmosphere .  witty and very entertaining ,  it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up . 
storyline :  the film spanning 4-odd hours covers in adequate details the happenings at the kargil sector near the loc in 1999 when the pakistani infiltrators had crossed the loc and had entered deep into the indian territory and the indian retaliation .  to know more about the story ,  i would suggest readers to read the news-items pertaining to kargil .   comment :  if one is looking for a formula story in this movie ,  then one can be sure that it is absent .  loc is a story of pure sacrifice ,  patriotism ,  courage and lots and lots of bullets and blood .  the movie hall where i saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the film shows indian bravery .  movie audience seemed similar to audiences like in an india vs pak cricket match .   watch the movie as a tribute to the army's sacrifice and for the characterization of the real-life war heroes  ( 4 pvc honoured heroes )  who have sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day .  the movie has made a brilliant portrayal of the army who have battled all odds in rough weather conditions .  the film's negatives are that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring . 
this video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995 .  beautifully done !  matthew perry and jennifer aniston have major on-screen chemistry when they talk about what the start button does .  i'm waiting for microsoft to release a special edition dvd complete with deleted scenes ,  bill gates commentary ,  a documentary of how windows 95 compares to windows xp ,  and more !   overall :  10/10  ( should have won at least a golden globe ) 
more like psychological analysis of movies ,  but psycho does sound better as a header .  the man in charge of the movie  ( the narrator if you will )  does depict movies here in his own way .  most of them are classics ,  but all of them are listed here at imdb and i'd strongly advise you to see them  ( especially the hitchcock movies ,  solyaris ,  conversation & and the lynch movies )  ,  because slavoj zizek will reference them !    or in other words ,  he might spoil them for you .  i don't remember if he spoiled more than those i've listed  ( i think the chaplin movies too )  ,  but as i wrote it'd be best if you watch them all beforehand !  in the imdb listing there is a movie missing ,  that i did report to them ,  so it might get up there pretty soon .  it's a meg ryan movie ,  but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways .   zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to ,  if you're open minded to see things through another perspective  ( even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you  .  .  .  it doesn't mean it will do that ,  but it could )  ! 
i grew up  ( b .  1965 )  watching and loving the thunderbirds .  all my mates at school watched .  we played  " thunderbirds "  before school ,  during lunch and after school .  we all wanted to be virgil or scott .  no one wanted to be alan .  counting down from 5 became an art form .  i took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what i loved as a child .  how bitterly disappointing .  the only high point was the snappy theme tune .  not that it could compare with the original score of the thunderbirds .  thankfully early saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series gerry anderson and his wife created .  jonatha frakes should hand in his directors chair ,  his version was completely hopeless .  a waste of film .  utter rubbish .  a cgi remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with homo sapiens subsp .  sapiens was a huge error of judgment . 
i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now .  i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day !  we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare .  wasn't necessary .  the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name ,  the fact that there is a bet ,  and a whole lot of worm eating .  oh yeah ,  i almost forgot ,  the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent .  how the kids know each other ,  the number of kids involved ,  how the bet came about ,  the number of worms that must be eaten ,  the time frame in which he has to eat the worms ,  how they are cooked ,  progression of friendships ,  climax scenes ,  etc .  ,  nothing is the same .  but somehow ,  it did not ruin the movie for me .  the characters are all enjoyable ,  and the film did not leave me disappointed .  word of caution for parents ,  there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billy's little brother referred to his penis as a  " dilly dick "  .  the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us ,   " does anybody know what a dilly dick is ?  "  lol .  that and an occasional  " shut up "  is as foul mouthed as this film gets .  my daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4  ( and was holding the empty nacho container just in case )  but was fine by worm 6 .  she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience . 
i couldn't make sense of this film much of the time ,  and neither could anyone else ,  based on other reviews .  the opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story .  in it ,  a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend .  he is assigned to photograph a mountain range .  it's rumored to be haunted ,  but i couldn't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film .  on his way ,  he meets a beautiful writer  ( patty shepard )  and convinces her to join him on his working trip .  throughout the film ,  there is this terrible music score ,  mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream  " shut up already !  !  !  "  what really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it's about to become good ,  though it never does .  there is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere .  the inn and the silent ,  abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous .  the foggy nights look real ,  not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set .  and the idea ,  while not original ,  had potential .  but it never does improve ,  at least not enough to be worthwhile .  here's how it goes ,  more or less .  they stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper  ( you expect him to be named igor )  with a hearing problem .  there is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window ,  but the scene is so dark ,  i had no idea what was going on .  whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me .  in any event ,  we never find out know what happened .  there is a scene where she wanders off during the night .  whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained .  another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen ,  then found again ,  with nothing stolen .  they wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman .  there are other things ,  including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained ,  an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way  ( will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them ?  )  ,  the witches themselves ,  a bunch of brunette women in white robes who don't show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained .  even the closing scene doesn't make any sense .  when all is said and done ,  most people will be saying ,   " huh ?  " 
i saw this movie at the theaters when i was about 6 or 7 years old .  i loved it then ,  and have recently come to own a vhs version .    my 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it .    i have enjoyed watching it again too .  though i have to admit it is not as good on a little tv .   i do not have older children so i do not know what they would think of it .    the songs are very cute .  my daughter keeps singing them over and over .   hope this helps . 
it really was that bad .  on a par with the  ( mercifully !  )  short-lived  " dirty dozen "  tv series that starred ben murphy and was made at around the same time  ( also on the cheap in yugoslavia )  .   i was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for telly savalas in particular .  he was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role  ( pushing 70 when he made this garbage )  ,  and the reviewer who draws parallels with telly the greek in this and john wayne in  " the green berets "  pretty much sums it up .   other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains ,  so i won't repeat them here .  but i will add that i'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet that savalas wears on his big ,  bloated head .    i'm also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 4 . 7 here at imdb .   as far as i'm concerned ,  it's a  " 1 "  right across the board .  if you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea  ( especially 20-plus years after the original )  - look no further than  " the dirty dozen - the fatal mission "  .   awful - avoid !  !  !  ! 
on the surface ,  this is an above-average post-war romantic comedy .  beneath the veneer ,  it is mgm character actor stunt-casting at its funniest .   the leads are straightforward ,  but all the secondaries are cast much against type .  margaret hamilton  ( aka wicked witch of the west )  ,  edward everett horton  ( professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget )  ,  and sig ruman  ( the marx brothers' nemesis in _night in casablanca_ and the always-wonderful _night at the opera_ )  ,  playing a well-intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together ,  instead of driving them apart as their  " usual "  characters would do .   it also pokes fun at many romantic-comedy conventions ,  which is another indication that this could be not so much a  " straight "  romantic comedy ,  as it is a wry send-up of the many post-war romantic comedies & their 2-dimensional ,  stock characters .   i've seen it only once ,  with interruptions ,  so i can't be positive ,  but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made ,  but is less successful now that viewers  " see "  these secondary characters through a completely different lens .  i'm assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars .  i thought it was hysterical . 
the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late  ( 1928 )  silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines .  davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines .  they appear in cheap comedies until marion is  " discovered "  and becomes a big dramatic star .  a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions .  davies & haines are a wonderful team  ( too bad they never made a talkie together )  and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin ,  douglas fairbanks ,  william s .  hart ,  john gilbert ,  elinor glynn ,  and marion davies  ( you have to see it )  are a hoot .  a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies ! 
no real plot to this one ,  just a series of short skits acting out some very old jokes .  i chuckled once or twice in the beginning ,  much to my chagrin .  but even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it's welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious  ( with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake )  .  still as bad as this movie is  ( and that's pretty putrid )  ,  it's a comedic gem compared to pretty much anything by aaron seltzer & jason friedberg  ( date movie ,  epic movie ,  meet the spartans )  also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way .   eye candy :  11 pair of tits ,  3 bushes ,  3 asses   my grade :  d   code red dvd extras :  original trailer for this film ;  and trailers for  " beyond the door "  ,   " dead pit "  ,   " the farmer "  ,   " obsessed ones "  ,   " power play "  ,   " sole survivor "  ,  &  " wacky taxi " 
over the years ,  we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what ,  keeping  " 8 simple rules "  going after john ritter died comes to mind ,  but this is probably the first time i cared .  the idea of having  " that 70's show "  without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous .  they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines ,  but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore .  it just didn't really connect ,  it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny .  the last season felt like the season too much for every single character ,  simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were .  focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working ,  because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere ,  and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours .  they also brought in the standard cousin oliver ,  only this time it just wasn't a kid .  whenever you heard somebody knock on the door ,  you started praying it wasn't randy ,  please let it not be randy .  the deal with randy was that he'd do really awful jokes ,  usually as red would say ,  smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches .  i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused .  the problems had started earlier though :  what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera .  everybody started being in love with everybody ,  emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea ,  with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching  " as the world turns "  .  i'm guessing this was character development ,  but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from  " family matters "  .  to be fair ,  the last episode ,  also because it had a cameo by topher grace  ( a cameo in his own show )  ,  was really good ,  even if not that funny either .   by the way ,  yet more criticism on season 8 :  what the hell was with the opening theme ?  not only did they use the same joke twice  ( a character not singing )  ,  fez scared the hell out of me .  dude ,  don't open your eyes that far .  but the first five seasons or so , among the best comedy ever broadcast . 
in 1993 ,   " the visitors "  was an enormous hit in france .  so ,  the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately ,  this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made .    this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises .  indeed ,  it's supposed to tell a sole story .  jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course .  the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century ,  and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard .  .  .  instead of this ,  the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot .  as a consequence ,  the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed ,  sometimes a bit of a mess .   but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors .  reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie :  they're going over the top and become annoying .  then ,  why did jean-marie poiré the film-maker engage muriel robin in the female main role ?  he made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful .  the other actors aren't better :  marie-anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau ,  unbearable .    of course ,  the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness .  certain sequences and dialogs are affected .  it also appears hollow because poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie .  thus ,  a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding .   a labored and disappointing follow-up .  anyway ,  what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial ?   
this movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects .  it is very weak on plot .  most of the computer talk was just mumbo-jumbo .  i watched this because i was a big fan of the original war games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology .  this movie had none of that .  most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks ,  but just lame .  it is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers .   the ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game .  no real hacking ,  so what was the point ?  movie was boring .  lame sequel . 
more wide-eyed ,  hysterical 50s hyper-cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti-social ,  pathological behaviour .  danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy .   it's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead  ( or in nursing homes )  .  i kinda thought about suing them for torture .  as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor ,  defenseless ear-drums ,  i felt instant ,  strong pain envelop my entire being .  that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits ,  nevermind glass .    " why didn't you switch the channel if you didn't like it ?  "  ,  you might ask angrily .  fair point ,  fair point .  .  .  the answer is that i wanted to ,  but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor ,  writhing in agony .  with my last ounces of energy ,  i tried to reach the remote but couldn't .   a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven ,  who then proceeds to  " pigmalionize "  him .  lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson ,  but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up .  this may seem like a rather thin plot ,  but this noisy movie is so chock-full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all .  this movie is relentless .  forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer's  " reign in blood "   ( as in a south park episode )  .  whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world ,  it's all infantile - as if they were all 6 year-olds impersonating grown-ups .  i can only envy people who find movies like this funny .  it must be great being easy-to-please :  what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious ,  gut-busting comedy .    but let's examine this phenomenon ,  the 50s musical .  my best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day-dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven  ( depending on whether you're church-going or lenin's-tomb-going )  ,  or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy-inspired places .  ttono is more akin to a representation of hell ,  but that's just me .  i don't seem to  " get "  musicals .  people talk ,  there is a story - but then all-of-a-sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened !  when you think about it ,  musicals are stranger than any science-fiction film .   worse yet ,  ttono  ( my favourite type of pizza ,  btw )  is not just a 50s musical ,  but one with opera squealing .  opera is proof that there is such a thing as over-training a voice - to the point where it becomes an ear-piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure .  the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet .  i tried lowering the volume .  i lowered it from 18 to 14 .  then from 14 to 10 .  then 8 .  i ended up lowering it to a 1 ,  which is usually so low that it's only heard by specially-trained dogs and certain types of marsupials ,  and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys !   take the scene in the small boat in the river .  danza starts off with one of his deafening ,  brain-killing tunes ,  and then .  .  .  nothing .  no animals anywhere to be seen .  even the crocodiles ,  who are mostly deaf ,  have all but left .  if you look carefully ,  you might even see the trees change colour ,  from green to yellow ,  in a matter of minutes .  no ,  this was not a continuity error ,  it was plain old torture of the flora .  and those trees were just matte paintings !  imagine how real trees would have reacted .   the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency ,  but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self-explosion .  i can listen to the loudest ,  least friendly death metal band for hours ,  but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache . 
in the previews ,   " the 40 year-old virgin "  boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't .  too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely .  and then the unexpected happens :  he falls in love .  what's more ,  there's a movie out about it ,  and it's called  " the 40 year-old virgin .  "   the virgin of the title is andy stitzer  ( steve carell )  ,  who is indeed 40 ,  works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures ,  which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see .  he has a lovely home theater system and watches  " survivor "  with his two kind elderly neighbors .  he's a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women .   now here's the real novelty with this picture :  it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute ,  mature fashion .  this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers .  it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low .  sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community  ( which are ,  in no way ,  meant to be taken as gay-bashing )  ,  as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game  (  " mortal kombat :  deception ,  "  no less - the ultimate testosterone-driven fightfest for guys )  .   as someone who is rapidly approaching 20 ,  collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed ,  i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar-themed movie could never have been .  i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing ;  everyone else looked like they were all past 40 .  a bit arrogant ,  i know ,  but would you  (  " you "  is italicized )  still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of  " the 40 year-old virgin "  ?   of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with  " morning rise "   ( don't ask )  ,  and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex .  when it's first discovered andy is a virgin ,  at 40 ,  his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david  ( paul rudd )  ,  jay  ( romany malco )  and cal  ( seth rogen )  all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman ,  which couldn't be any further from the truth .  the truth is ,  andy loves women ,  but past traumatic experiences  ( revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence )  have put him on the sidelines for good .   david ,  jay ,  and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid ,  so help them all .  but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster ,  as proved by one date with nicky  ( leslie mann )  ,  who puts andy through the worst drunk-driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth  ( elizabeth banks )  ,  the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend .   things brighten up for andy when he meets trish  ( catherine keener )  ,  the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people .  hmmm .  and with that nice-looking collection of action figures ,  you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him ,  that is if he can ever  " do the deed .  "   at last ,  this is the sex romp we've been waiting for .  it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through ,  not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture :  how many of us  " lonely guys "  want to be a lonely guy forever ?  the important thing we're taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself .  i don't think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does  ( which is side-splitting to be honest ,  and according to this website and various other news articles ,  was in fact real ,  and so was the blood on carell's shirt afterward )  .    " the 40 year-old virgin "  was directed by judd apatow and co-written by himself and carell ,  which originated as a skit that starred carell .  carell is sweet and human ,  as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut .  this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i've ever seen and is not offensive  ( a whole lot )  because its characters are treated with dignity and respect .  even carell's buddies ,  who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities ,  can be related to on a fundamental level .   the way  " the 40 year-old virgin "  plays out is indeed funny in the end ,  but i'll leave that up to you ,  the viewer ,  to observe .  surely ,  if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener ,  then it's true :  it is never too late !   10/10
this film was screen as part of the 2007 sydney mardi gras film festival .  i had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for me .   i actually like films that take time to develop ,  films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow .  stillness is good .  but this film though was just plain slow .   credit must go to the two main actors .  there was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people ,  misfits really ,  come together in a very awkward way .  there were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them .   i also liked the setting and the way it was shot .  it was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the film's intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the characters .   i just don't understand the ending .  what was the point of it all ? 
misty ayers had a smoking body ,  and that's all this movie was about .  pure exploitation flick .  i started playing a game with myself ,  counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music .  and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes .  case in point :  casually walking into a room and saying  " hello "  was scored with chase music from a roman epic .  i'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released .  what i learned from this movie :  that women's low-rise panties existed in 1954 .  i'm talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties .  at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing  ( except for bra and panties ,  sadly )  .  also includes horrendous dubbing ,  leading to a  " look out !  godzirra !  "  effect . 
lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful tv series that have never done  .  .  .  and so is  .  .  .  if you lovers of mysteries ,  intrigue and adventure this is the series for you  .  .  . in the first season  .  .  .  since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward until you get to the second season  .  .  .  in the second you lose a little its cocktail of mystery and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the island hides  .  .  .  the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first season  .  .  .  the fourth also not let pass unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries  .  .  .  but not as the second season but at a somewhat different  .  .  .  for the fifth season expects  .  .  . 
more directors like nacho vigalondo need a greater outlet for their talents .  7 : 35 de la mañana is absolute genius .  what nacho is able to convey in 8 minutes takes some hollywood directors hours of film to achieve .  i watched this smiling ,  but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way .  you sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min .  nugget .  i was entertained ,  but was disturbed at the same time .  not many people can do that in just 8 minutes .  it starts off simple enough .  a young women comes in for breakfast at her usual place .  she sits down and someone starts singing .  from there ,  the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe .  it is in black & white ,  but this helps with the feeling the film gives you . this film makes you want to know more about the characters ,  how they interacted previously and how the ending impacted their lives afterward .  i guess it like the old saying ,  " leave them wanting more "  ,  nacho vigalondo is able to do that .  watch this when you can .  show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes . 
roger corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors/producers in history .  he was single-handedly responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever  ( like the edgar allen poe adaptations  " masque of the red death "  and  " pit and the pendulum "  )  as well as some insufferably cheap and tacky rubbish quickies  ( like  " creature from the haunted sea "  and  " she gods of the shark reef "  )  .  corman also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and  simply put  nearly impossible to judge properly .   " the trip "  ,  for example ,  as well as this imaginatively titled  " gas-s-s-s "  can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation .  in other words ,  they're incredibly strange hippie-culture influenced movies .  half of the time you haven't got the slightest idea what's going on ,  who these characters are that walk back and forth through the screen and where the hell this whole thing is going .  the plot is simply and yet highly effective :  a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly annihilates that the entire world population over the age of 25 .  this *could* be the basic premise of an atmospheric ,  gritty and nail-bitingly suspenseful post-apocalyptic sci-fi landmark ,  but writer george armitage and roger corman decided to turn it into a  " trippy "  road-movie comedy .  none of the characters is even trying to prevent their inevitable upcoming deaths ;  they just party out in the streets and found little juvenile crime syndicates .   " gas-s-s-s "  is a disappointingly boring and tries overly hard to be bizarre .  the entire script appears to be improvised at the spot and not at all funny .  definitely not my cup of tea ,  but the film does have a loyal fan base and many admirers ,  so who am i to say that it's not worth your time or money ? 
it's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself .  the paragraph-long  " plot summary "  written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie .  i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the  ( bleep )  was going on .  alas ,  to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story ,  if you could call it a story .  it's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here ,  filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations .  newsflash to the the creators :  i paid to watch you make a movie .  i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free .  and rosario dawson ?  this is somebody i've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face ,  and i can see why .  she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie ,  a or b .  i figured okay ,  maybe she didn't really want the role ,  just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into ?  wrong .  she was listed as one of the producers .  next time you produce something ,  don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act .  if you really can ,  then create a decent character for you to become .  also ,  somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes ,  i hate to say it ,  but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats .  that's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters .  the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist .  as for the maya character ,  she didn't seem like a real person .  anyway i'm ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made . 
with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity ,  this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene .  the movie plays much like a dream ,  and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it .  characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless .  but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices .  the film works isn't trying to work as history ,  but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies .    i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie ,  but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away .  this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever ,  and there is a wild imagination in its style .  i can completely understand why people would hate it ,  but i give it 9/10 . 
this movie is one of the funniest ,  saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the balkans yet again ,  45 years after the time depicted .  all the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger ,  sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response .  the accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types ,  however ,  make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex-yugoslavia to its madness .  in fact ,  no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie ,  and its twin ,  *maratonci trce pocasni krug . * did i mention it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen ? 
when i first saw this show ,  i thought it looked interesting .  i watched it ,  saw how it revolved around sarah ,  like the character sees the world .  .  . revolving around her .  i got it ,  but wasn't laughing very much .   onstage and in her show ,  she's racist ,  crude ,  insensitive and hugely self-centered .  i didn't get her at first ,  and took it all at face value .  then i got to see her movie ,  jesus is magic .  i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me ,  explaining to me just what 'language' she's speaking .  she's like marilyn manson ,  working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images ,  but you eventually realise it isn't an assault ,  it's a statement .  and once you understand that ,  you find you're glad someone's finally giving it to you straight .   i don't mean to suggest only smart people will understand ,  or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy .  while i like a lot of 'smart' shows ,  i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm .  i get the impression that it's good ,  but i just don't get it .  many people will never get the sarah silverman program ,  but i'm glad i eventually came around .   the creators of this show do work hard ,  every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot ,  but with songs ,  or dream sequences ,  production numbers .  these people aren't putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers ,  they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together .  if i was to predict the future of this show ,  i'd say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks & geeks .  it will get canceled before it's time and live on in fans' hearts and on dvd .  but take heart ,  ssp creators ,  your audience is out there ,  and we'll be watching for as long as they let you make the show . 
a movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword .  i've seen schlock in my time but after viewing the wretched mess i don't think i can ever watch a another movie again .  may god pity the souls who made this .   premise- ex-army quiet stud ,  underwear model type character  ( well acted actually )  goes looking for the girl who sent him a xmas card while serving in the military .  lands in with her cabin living-granola type family who are right-wing loggers .  family takes to him and it takes 2 hours of our time for the chick to see he's a better catch than her liberal looking  , french wine drinking ,  porsche driving ,  loud cell phone talking ,  lazy ,  city slicking ,  jewish looking fiancé .   the bad- 1d characters ,  1d themes .  being beat over the head with the pro-military theme .  ed asner .   the good- commercial breaks were long .  peter jason .  it ended . 
the forest isn't just your everyday standard slasher/backwoods cannibal fare ,  it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well .  the story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip .  a cave dwelling ,  cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them .  there is something you don't see every slasher .  director don jones gets an  " a "  for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level ,  the acting is just simply average except for jeanette kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman  ( michael brody aka gary kent )  .   the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest .  they realize too late that someone is stalking them .  they are both dispatched in typical slasher fare .  our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film ,  except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw ,  pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife's lover .   the forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn't work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting .  4/10
this film is the worst film ,  but it ranks very high for me .  it is how a slasher movie should be .  it takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students .  the teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers .  it is filled with good catholic priest ,  sexually repressed humor .  bad hair ,  bad clothes .  the dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes .  the slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia .  a lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad ,  i recommend this film for a fun time .  get a case of cheap beer and some friends ,  watch it and laugh . 
in a poor village in mexico ,  the colonel  ( fernando luján )  lives with his asthmatic wife lola  ( marisa paredes )  in an old house .  lola still grieves the death of their son augustin some time ago .  the colonel has been expecting for his pension of fighter in a war against catholic church for almost twenty-seven years .  however ,  for political reasons ,  the present government wants to forget this old fight .  without having any possession or money ,  but a valuable gamecock ,  they struggle to survival with the expectation of the acknowledgement letter from the government ,  recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension .  this slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most of the elder retired persons in third world countries .  in brazil ,  most of the retired persons has to survive with about us$ 80 , 00 per month .  the debts of the colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son ,  otherwise he would be buried as an indigent .  outstanding performance of the cast ,  in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries .  my vote is eight .    title  ( brazil )  :   ( `não se escreve ao coronel' )   ( do not write to the colonel )   
a fine effort for an australian show .  which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality aussie drama .  dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way ?  no .  but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us .  the cast is great ,  gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen ,  the british cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters .  but abe forsythe may be the saving light  ( not that it needs saving )  if this show is to get another season .  i wasn't a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener .  its also good to see brooke satchwell again .  lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode . 
i'm ask .  .  .  what a f*** are whit the real-tv never i see some b******* in my life is :  a****** ,  dirty ,  f****** bad and other a******* things but anything more is just a piece of american s*** all time britney saying ''oh s*** ,  i wanna see his cock ,  i wanna f*** ,  and stuck his d***'' and he thinking ''oh like i gone to still her money'' it's just another show of s*** any one more the only good are what britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another s*** show in this s*** sill out the money pure sex all f******* time ,  i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my f****** money
of all the versions of the odyssey  ( or of any greek mythological story for that matter )  ,  this in my opinion is the best of them all .  almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions ,  e . g .  the absence of scylla & charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece , not some hollywoodish sword-and-sandal b-flick .  notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian ,  if one is familiar with the storyline ,  he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying  ( provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand )  .  at least i did ,  and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more . 
a pot - boiler if ever i saw one .  a supposed thriller borrowing from  " a time to kill "  ,   " silence of the lambs "  ,  even an inverted  " in the heat of the night "  with a little reverse murder ,  a la  " strangers on a train "  thrown in ,  it fails abysmally where all the above ,  to a large degree ,  succeeded .  namely ,  in delivering thrills .  the plot seems condensed from a bigger book ,  making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving ,  while the direction lacks pace and verve .  to rein in any kudos ,  a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too .  connery is clearly slowing down in his old age ,  barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh - darn kids of his .  he even has a father in law who seems younger than him .  laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you're confused from the outset as to whether he's a bad guy or a good guy .  someone once said that flashbacks shouldn't lie - they do ,  confusedly ,  here .  the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles .  the supposed climax managed too ,  to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back ,  not as should have been the aim ,  front edge of my seat .  mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure . 
sergio martino's the case of the scorpion's tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70's heyday of the genre .  an explosion on an aeroplane results in one million dollars in insurance money for a bereaved but unfaithful wife .  the money is subsequently snatched by a black-clad assassin and a series of brutal murders follow .   scorpion's tail plays the mystery element ,  written by giallo specialist ernesto gastaldi ,  fairly straight .  but ,  being a giallo ,  the murders themselves are memorable and well-staged .  in fact ,  the violence in this movie is very strong in places - a scene with a broken bottle being particularly graphic .  the emphasis on the violence no doubt influencing the giallo genre to move into more and more extreme territory .  but like the best films in the genre the brutality is offset by a good score and attractive photography .  the music by bruno nicolai is at times reminiscent of ennio morricone's avant-garde work in the bird with the crystal plumage but is also strong in its own right .  the photography is helped by the nice use of foreign locales - in this case london and athens - where martino manages to get in ,  respectively ,  the houses of parliament and the acropolis !  there is also some inventive camera-work too ,  the most effective being the use of slow motion in a sequence where a woman runs towards the door where the maniac is prowling outside .  in this particular scene martino has the killer hack through the door with a knife in a manner influenced by dario argento's crystal plumage ,  however ,  it also has the killer attempt to flick the latch open with the blade of a knife which is something repeated later by argento in suspiria .  so martino's film is influential in its own right .   this is a good solid giallo that both genre and non-genre fans can appreciate .  the performances are good and the production values are fine  ( although the plane explosion is ,  shall we say ,  somewhat low-budget !  )  .  the dvd release by noshame is nice .  it has both the english and italian language options which is a real bonus .  however ,  it is worth pointing out that at times you need to be a fast reader to fully appreciate the english subtitle option .  this applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras .  this is a minor point though ,  the dvd release is a worthy addition to any giallo collection . 
let me put it another way :  balls .  or ,  how about bollo*ks .  this is truly awful ,  more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise .  julia roberts is a skilled actress ,  and usually her work is of the highest standard .  this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient .  normally she is the consummate professional ,  yet i swear that in her eyes ,  there were signs of bewilderment and despair .   the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director  ( chris walken )  turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors .  unfortunately ,  that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential .  too little ,  too late .   zeta jones was wooden ,  cusack was cusack ,  and crystal should stick to acting .  the two talented ex-buffy stars had different experiences - green hopelessly mis-cast ,  and balfour under-used .  well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made . 
all the ingredients of low-brow b-movie cult cinema .  topless  ( and bottomless )  girls ,  kung-fu kicking chefs ,  slave traders ,  evil germans with mustaches ,  cameron mitchell and sword-wielding zombies .   and ,  of course the breasts of camille keaton ,  who's best known display occurs in the feminist exploitation classic i spit on your grave .  we also must mention the hooters of jewel shepard ,  who play a hooker in the recent film the cooler .   lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar ,  in a whorehouse ,  and on a boat load of martial artists heading to some zombie island where bad martial artists go to die or something like that .   tops and bottoms come off easily and frequently as travelers are well lubricated thanks to the boat owner .   then disaster strikes as their boat is destroyed and they land on the zombie island where mas monks sacrifice young girls to the dead martial artists to bring them back to life .   just when you thought it had everything ,  there are piranhas in the water .  yum yum a big fat german for dinner .   just the thing for your next zombie fest . 
first of all ,  what is good in the movie  ?  some pretty actress  ?  the exotic background  ?  the fact that the actors don't laugh while acting  ( i would have if i had been in their situation )   ?  i don't know .  the storyline is simple  :  a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who  ( another abstract painter )  killed his little brother ,  a male prostitute  ( raped by another priest when he was young .  .  .  )  .  i'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers ,  art or religion .  dennis hopper is not very good here .  this is the worst episode of the worst season of  " profiler "   ( the serie )  with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences  ( the uncle is the policeman who ,  the girl who lives at another victim's house could have a baby with the priest ,  etc .  ,  etc )  . 
you've never seen anything like it .  once the coup begins ,  it's the most dazzling ,  edge-of-your-seat thriller you'll ever see -- even though you know the outcome .  and it's all real ,  because it's a documentary -- amazing .    by the time it was over ,  it was on my top 10 list of all time great movies .   disregard the slobbering right-wing fanatics .  everyone i know who has seen this film gives it the 4-star rating .  even if you don't care about politics or about venezuelan politics ,  you will find yourself nerve-racked and -- believe it -- on the edge of your seat .   it's a roller-coaster ride . 
a truly frightening film .  feels as if it were made in the early '90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good ,  normal ,  mainstream-aspiring people .  retrograde to the point of being offensive ,  ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad ,  lonely ,  sex-crazed gays .  wow !  who knew ?  the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes  ( the effeminate buffoon ,  the bitter ,  lonely queen ,  the fag hag ,  etc .  )  and the main characters are milquetoast ,  middle-class ,  middlebrow clones ,  of little interest .   as far as the romantic & ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned ,  there's not much to say :  we've seen it all before ,  and done much better . 
i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident .  .  . well it must of been .  blonde women being stalked , the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute's then disappearing and reappearing , hiding . he was'nt even a super hero so i don't know how he did it . he could'nt frighten a cat and that's not hard to do .   the old  " mirror in the bathroom " is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago .  you had the cop on the trail of the villain , another cliché ( played by idris elba with a very convincing american accent , he's from london )  the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of cliché's and make's  " scary move " which was a comedy look scary .  pathetic ! 
i have only recently been able to catch up with the films of marilyn miller since they are not shown on tcm in the uk . i have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20s . what was she really like . to some stars of this era like jolson some of the magic still shines through , but alas not for miller . her dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographed , her singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes ruby keeler seem like hepburn . even worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deleted . so we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal . she was being paid $500000 for this ! so i have only two conclusion . either she was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent at all . i think that the truth is nearer the later than the former . 
i watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed .   heather graham and tom cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours  ( or however long it actually was )  .  from the beginning ,  every single element of this movie is unbelievable .  this movie made me chuckle several times ,  but they were mainly out of shock that the director/writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together .   the movie's focus is gray  ( graham )  and her issues with intimacy .  things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly way too much in common .   interesting ,  intriguing .  however ,  instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable ,  the director keeps taking gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all .  being an lgbt individual ,  this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming-out process .   ( i'll be insulted if the writer's queer .  )  had it not been for the cute chemistry between cavanaugh and graham  ( which ,  by the way ,  was understandably forced )  ,  i would give it a negative 3 stars . 
american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa .  on the train he met a french girl celine .  although they met the first time ,  they talked like good friends .  when the train stopped at vienna ,  jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna .  then the romantic story unfolded .   at first they were cautious .  the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store .  they peeked at each other ,  though their eyes did not contact .  after in-depth conversation ,  they relationship became close .  then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend .  their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words .   love is a strange thing .  when you really want it ,  it will not come as you wished .  love needs mutual understanding .  without it ,  love will not last long .  spiritual harmony is the most important for love .   excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie .   one of the best romance movies .  9/10
i was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that i felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off .  how any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me .  i know that the intent of the movie is to shock ,  but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive  ( holding back vomit as i type )  - please !  i shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby .  i had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point .  no wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in hmv .  i really have no desire to see any other movie by this uwe person .  anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy .  period . 
anemic comedy-drama ,  an unhappy ,  seemingly rushed affair featuring cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit-man who's been hired to kill her by her husband .  chazz palminteri ,  as the talkative hired gun ,  adapted the screenplay from his own play ,  with stagy set-ups and back-and-forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear .  an air of gloom hangs over the entire project ,  and director paul mazursky can't get cher out of her perpetual funk  ( she's listless )  .  despite all the top talent  ( including robert de niro as one of the producers )  ,   " faithful "  is fraudulent ,  with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life .  *1/2 from ****
okay ,  i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst !  but it's not !  !  !  haven't's you seen freddy's revenge ?  ?  ?  wtf !  that was the worst of all !  !  !  now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it's cool that he had a daughter etc .  etc .   and then i found out it was in 3-d !  !  !  i was so excited ,  i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the 3-d sequences .  quite a lot was in 3-d though like lisa zanes hand ,  dream demons ,  freddy's claw  ( more than once )  ,  lezlie dean holding a knife ,  lisa zane with a baseball bat ,  doc's hand ,  freddy's head exploding .   i truly loved this movie because it was in 3-d ,  but i wish the whole movie was in 3-d not just the last 15 minutes .   by the way it's 15 minutes not ten !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
i just watched the incredible melting man for the second time ,  and it was even more boring than when i first watched it .  i don't understand why it has become such a 'cult classic' when it is so tediously dull .  the opening scene looks promising ,  when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life .  after this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses ,  whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut .  the makeup is quite good ,  and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic .  there is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river ,  and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open .  there's not much to wet yourself over though ,  most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening .  there isn't much gore ,  at least in the vipco dvd i watched .    no ,  the incredible melting man is not that great at all .  i'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it .  if you want a true sci-fi/horror cult classic ,  watch the deadly spawn instead ! 
conventional wisdom is that a sequel is seldom as good as the original movie .  there are occasional exceptions ,  but this is not one of them .  disney should have quit while they were ahead .  this was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining 101 dalmatians . 
imagine that you could have anything you wanted ,  go anywhere you wished ,  be anything you'd ever dreamed of being - through thought alone .  now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life .  what would you do ?  would such powers be worth your soul ?  this is the dilemma presented to captain christopher pike in  " the cage "  the now-legendary pilot episode of the original star trek series .  famously deemed  " too cerebral "  and  " too cold "  by nbc brass and rejected ,   " the cage "  was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time ,  and gene roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste ,  with the result being this truly classic star trek episode ,  which embeds  " the cage "  into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale ,  a landmark in tv history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen .  .  . star date 3012 :  the uss enterprise diverts to starbase 11 after mr .  spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the enterprise .  surprisingly ,  the message cannot be from captain pike after all ,  as he is now confined to a wheelchair ,  mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident .  kirk and starbase commanding officer commodore mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery ,  but before the matter can be cleared up ,  spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny ,  kidnapping the helpless captain pike and hijacking the enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few vulcan nerve pinches .  soon ,  the enterprise is headed for the remote ,  forbidden planet of talos iv .  mendez informs kirk that talos iv is under interdiction ,  and any contact with the planet by starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence ,  meaning that spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself ,  and kirk as well ,  given that the captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities .  appalled ,  kirk and mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft ,  which itself becomes dangerous when the enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone .  spock - knowing that kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the captain to certain death .  after ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard ,  spock reveals what he has done to mccoy and demands to be arrested ,  after having set the starship on an irreversible course to talos iv .  upon reassuming command ,  kirk demands an explanation ,  whereupon spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - mendez ,  kirk ,  and the crippled invalid captain pike .  spock's encyclopedic knowledge of starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence .  spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the federation and the inhabitants of talos iv - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the enterprise itself under pike's command .  kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail ,  but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by pike himself ,  who turns out to have been lured to talos iv by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously .  among the survivors is vina ,  a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster .  pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot ,  whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the talosians ,  a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality .  after pike's capture ,  the rest of the  " survivors "  vanish as none of them really existed except vina .  the episode ends when the tribunal learns that spock's  " evidence "  is in fact being transmitted to the enterprise directly from talos iv ,  in violation of starfleet regulations .  starfleet orders an immediate halt to the transmissions ,  and we wonder what will happen next .  .  . to be continued in a review of  " the menagerie :  part ii "  ! 
after just watching five across the eyes ,  i gotta be honest .  .  . i just didn't like it .  i had read so many good reviews on this movie ,  but i just did'nt get where these reviews have came from ,   i have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making ,  and i'm sure the directors will do well for themselves ,  but the budget they had was the main problem ,  there was two cameras used in the entire film  ( which was ok )  but they seemed like really cheap cameras .  another problem was the sound ,  you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time ,  all talking on top of each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're saying .   it had a good idea going for it ,  in a nutshell ,  they hit a parked car then drive off ,  a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit ,  driven by a mad woman ,  who wants to kill them ,  and has plenty of chances to do so !  .  .  . and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape ,  but don't !    very frustrating .  .  . i only just scraped through this one ! 
this is one of the worst films i've seen in years !  !  you could randomly pluck 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film .  absolute waste of time watching it .  i only gave it a 2 as i like gory films but this is just plain rubbish .  the acting  ( and i use that term very loosely )  is abysmal ,  someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film ?  ?  don't waste your time watching this .  hostel was a better film by some way .  i cannot believe that someone has spent money making this ,  i hope for the producers sake it only cost $50 , 000 to make - it looks like a school project ,  made by kids who haven't got a clue .  did this even make it to the cinema ?  ? 
this film is a pure failure .  i am a steve martin fan ,  but even he can't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script .  think  " police academy 7 "  and apply it to a military parody .  yuck .   i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received  ( and rightfully deserved !  )  .  it is extremely misleading .  i have often seen this film marked down to $3 . 00 in the grocery store and now i certainly know why .   if only i could get my 90 minutes back .  .  . 
will smith is one of the best actors of all time .  i don't know how he does it .  i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it .  he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there .  this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet .  i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head .  amazing and sad all at the same time .  thanks again will .  you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie .  you cannot miss a thing .  make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your man/woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle .  well worth the money that you will pay to watch it .  .  don't wait for it to come on tv . 
3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for stanley tucci to be a producer/moody deep doctor .  unlike house he has absolutely no personality and unlike grey's anatomy the brain surgery cases are't even interesting .  this programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for neurlogical cases - yet there's nothing interesting or exciting going on !  not even the so called pathetic 'feud' between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations .  in the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads's social life as a father - snooze !  boring and pointless .   this show is pants , there's a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special . 
despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals ,  this movie is not for everyone .   the story is very similar to other movies ,  in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age ,  and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family .  she does that by choosing some kind of sport ,  and with the help of a local boy ,  that for some reason falls in love with her ,  she confronts her problems and wins .   in girlfight it's boxing ,  in bend it like beckham it's soccer ,  and now it's kung fu .   but fighter is much inferior product than these two ,  it was simply embarrassing to watch it .  semra turan ,  the  " actress "  that playing the role of a teenage girl ,  maybe can do a lot of things ,  but one thing she can't do is to act .  her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy ,  the dramatic situations ,  in which she tries to show some emotions ,  are dreadful ,  her body and facial language are of amateur actress ,  badly instructed by the director .  the rest of the cast is a little better ,  but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot .  besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer .   even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this ,  it's just so boring .  the slow motion was really unnecessary ,  the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration ,  and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions ,  not actually fighting .  not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys ,  and knocks them off their feet .    the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's european .  it's very easy to publicize this movie - a first martial arts film from denmark ,  but don't be fooled ,  it's not .  it's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems ,  which are ,  by the way ,  not really convincing .   bad movie with embarrassing lines ,  acting and story . 
the plot is tight .  the acting is flawless .  the directing ,  script ,  scenery ,  casting are all well done .  i watch this movie frequently ,  though i don't know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me .  see it and drop me a line if you can figure out why i like it so much . 
we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books .  while not particularly accurate adaptations ,  these movies were nonetheless excellent films .  some great examples are the harry potter series ,  the lord of the rings trilogy ,  and ,  to a lesser extent ,  almost every disney film ever made .  however ,  i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies .  not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l'engle's fan base ,  it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting ,  acting ,  special effects and ,  ultimately ,  respect for the audience .  mind you ,  i'm not trying to be mean ;  on the contrary ,  i went into this affair with an open mind .  i figured that a made-for-t . v .  movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script .  after all ,  the star wars spin-off ewoks was decent ,  if a little silly .  come to think of it ,  the original star wars was made on  " a lunch money budget "  ,  and look where it took george lucas !  however ,  from the first scene onward ,  disappointment started enveloping me as if i'd gotten too close to the black thing while tessering .    the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997  ( a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic )  ,  mrs .  whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time .  the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief .  aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard  ( star trek :  first contact and radio )  as our favorite star-turned-mentor ,  the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow .  that's right ,  a crow .  moreover ,  the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old ;  the majestic half-man ,  half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle .  had i been five ,  this would have psychologically traumatized me for life .  the worst part is the fact that when it spoke ,  it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync ,  resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single ,  unmoving cheek ,  thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e . t .   having gotten the most painful part out of the way ,  i must go on to the tear-inducing one :  the characters ,  the acting ,  and the story .  i ,  personally ,  had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films :  plain hair ,  glasses ,  and a figure most supermodels would find laughable .  she was always a slightly anxious ,  humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua .  in the film ,  she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever .  in fact ,  she makes me feel sorry for poor mr .  jenkins ,  her school principal ,  who continuously has to deal with her .  calvin ,  the kind ,  intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock !  the irony is horrible .  as for the memorable happy medium ,  they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is  " above gender "  and likes to look at  " funny "  things ,  such as girls falling off of swings .  the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace ,  mrs .  whatsit and the man with red eyes  ( nicknamed  " the dude with red eyes "  due to his complete reinvention as a character )  .   the story is a mess .  a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban ,  which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book ,  yet kept the sole of the original work .  here ,  the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld ,  apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed .  as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen ,  the flat-nosed wookies of ixchel  ( who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks )  tear the spine up .  as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth-like camazotz was ,  the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil .    i am very sorry that this film exists .  i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad .  it's the way the characters are written that ruins it .  a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan ,  directed by george lucas or steven spielberg ,  enhanced at industrial light and magic ,  scored by john williams ,  given its sound at skywalker sound ,  edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox .  in its current state ,  the film is unworthy to be shown to self-respecting people .  even madeleine l'engle thought it was bad .  the book was good ,  the film was bad ,  and mrs .  whatsit was ugly .   score :  0 . 1/10  ( if i could )    pros :   they got the names right .    cons :    it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation ,  script ,  acting and special effects ,  not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book .  oh ,  and the main cover/poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle .  some might say that this symbolizes high adventure .  i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn't even bother to photoshop meg's arm on properly . 
one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in american history began .  the members of the summer of love culture ,  at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80's ,  were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life ,  whatever that meant .  for those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance ,  their's was the culture of wonderland .  a love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority ,  values and  " the establishment "  is the world that the film captures .    the sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the american  " house "  apart .  once the battles were over ,  we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage .  the characters in the wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the seventies ;  part biker ,  part hippie ,  part crook ,  all outcast .  no ideology to express ,  just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing .  ron ,  billy and david fancy themselves as some sort of robin hoods with dope .  they talk of love and behave violently ;  they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten ;  they steal from everyone .   holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of anti-matter like sex ,  and drugs and rock & roll ,  when the lab technicians get bored and move on .    the film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug fiends in their element .  the fact that holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant .  that story was told in  " boogie nights "  .  this is a story of a transitional and forgettable era . 
silly ,  often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on tim  ( jeff daniels )  and the people in his orbit .   am always amazed by daniels .  he showed such depth and promise in 1983's  " terms of endearment "  as shirley maclaine's philandering son-in-law .  as the years have passed ,  daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good ,  meaty role .  instead ,  he is in inane comedies such as  " dumb and dumber .  "   as for this picture ,  it fails because of the subject matter .  at least ,  the television show brought about a variety of situations .  in the film ,  we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian-martin .   the part of mrs .  brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the film .  on television ,  pamela britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed .  in the film version ,  a blond bomb-shell as brown ,  tries romantic entanglement .   television star ray walston has a small role as a government agent ,  or is he really that ?   a very big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much . 
i saw this film when it first came out in 1978 ,  when i was a sophomore in high school .  i took a date to see it .  i didn't  " get any ,  "  needless to say ,  because the film was so bad !  joan rivers' career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful ,  unfunny crap .  in fact ,  unfunny isn't a severe enough term :  this film is anti-funny !  you walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen .  this isn't worth watching out of curiosity ,  or out of any sense of it being  " so-bad-it's-good .  "  not even the gang at mst3k could've made this worth watching !  the fact that billy crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle . 
a squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy .  elvis presley plays an indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert-spread in arizona ,  where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle  ( which is in dire need of a stud )  .  what director peter tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills ,  though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages  ( his social commentary isn't exactly pointed ,  but tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes )  .  despite colorful supporting turns by katy jurado and joan blondell ,  the general wackiness gets way out of hand ,  and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest .  as for elvis ,  he's loose and frisky throughout--and while it's nice to see him having fun on-screen ,  one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point .  this shambles of a picture has a distinct what-the-hell feel to it ,  and though spirits are high ,  the returns are mostly low .  *1/2 from ****
all i can really say is that i'm glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie ,  or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life .  the acting was terrible ,  the plot was even worse .  there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud .  i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst3k . 
to say that thunderbirds is a horrid ,  forced ,  in-your-face ,  ugly looking ,  nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldn't be saying enough .  there are only two reasons i can think of why you'd watch this film :  1 ;  you've seen thunderbirds when you were young  ( like i did )  and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up .  or ,  2 ;  you're seeing it with someone under ten years old .   thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts .  the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle ,  humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it .  from the off ,  thunderbirds is wrong ,  wrong ,  wrong .  the whole moral message and 'goal' is set up in an excruciating way :  jeff tracy  ( a new low for bill paxton )  tells his youngest son alan he's not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy island's bowels to fire up thunderbird one .  the whole film is then a series of events and miss-fires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird five .   the film relies on kid actors to carry the film :  a 16 year old alan tracy  ( corbet )  ,  a 16 year old tin tin  ( hudgens )  and a 14 year old fermat  ( fulton )  who is brains' son .  to say that watching the 'adventures' they get up to is painful is an understatement .  frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil 'hood'  ( kingsley )  in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film ;  it only differs when everyone's in a different location .  also ,  the whole 'mind control' thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood  forced and incidental .   i know that most 'film's for kids' these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds it's done in a way that fetishises lady penelope .  sophia myles plays penelope and i think it's no coincidence she's a little older than the rest of the kids  at 24 years old ,  it's almost too good to be true .  her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push .  we see her in the bath ,  bubbles up to her neck watching tv ;  in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet ,  bare and bubble covered foot .  frequent shots of her massive ,  bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes :  this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman !  twinned with this ,  her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh ,  dominant ,  english accent ;  sounding like a commanding mistress  ( well ,  she is lady penelope after all  and you'd better make sure call her that )  the whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids won't notice but it sure as hell is there .   the actual plot of the hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre ,  the characters that are his bodyguards :  a geeky looking woman and hard bodied black man who gets agitated a lot .  are we supposed to be laughing at this ?  what about the fight scenes ?  poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises ?  it's utterly ,  utterly laughable .   the list goes on .  the way bill paxton plays it all so seriously ,  like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another ,  the way ford motor company have their logo slapped all over the place .  news bulletin :  sponsored by ford ,  the camera even moves to endorse ford several times when cars are in shot ,  the way the cgi looks like something out of a computer game video clip  it's infuriating .  the fact we are told to believe that a 16 year old girl can swim in the freezing thames ,  against the current ,  rescue a downed monorail  ( monorail over the thames !  ?  )  ,  get back to the hatch and thus ;  save the day all the time holding her breath .  it is absolute bull and the makers know it  i don't even know if a 10 year old would swallow it .   in short :  avoid ,  avoid ,  avoid .  thunderbirds is infuriating ,  unfunny ,  poorly scripted and even the rolls royce was taken out and replaced by a flying car  everything that could go wrong ,  did go wrong . 
these guys are anything but the usual suspects !  they are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it , but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that . no one is better than william h macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck . this is probably his best performance since fargo . sam rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection , and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also . luis guzman brought some great comic relief as cosimo , and george clooney stole every scene in his cameo role . the heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious .   the direction was also spot on by the russo brothers . there was certainly a coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers . they have a long way to go to match the coen's but this is an excellent start and i look forward to their next celluloid outing .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  " yo mutha's a whore "  ! 
i should say at the outset there are many ,  many things i love about 'forbidden planet' and yes ,  i certainly consider it a 'classic' science-fiction film for many reasons .  but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion .  no less an authority than leonard maltin says 'forbidden planet'  "  .  .  . is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre .  "  ambitious ?  without a doubt .  intelligent ?  depends on what part of the film you're talking about .  it certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point .  at a cost of nearly $2 million  ( this was 1956 ,  remember )  ,  mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling ,  eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before ,  even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects .  'charming' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies ,  yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here .  even the dreaded 'monster from the id' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the disney people ,  unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8 .  when i see the various sets and take note of the art design ,  models ,  costumes ,  etc .  ,  i am reminded of nothing so much as 'the wizard of oz , ' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects .  so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless .  'forbidden planet' is wonderful to look at .  the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated ,  matte paintings of planets and space in the background ,  and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth .  it's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you'd ever see .  the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex ,  where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible .  but then we get to the actors ,  darn it .  the performances are almost uniformly awful ,  though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor ,  except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble .  even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance ,  it's lugubrious at times .  a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j . j .  adams ,  and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film .  he seems to instinctively know ,  thirty years ahead of time ,  that his true forte' lay in comedy ,  as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines .  every forced reaction ,  whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation ,  looks right out of a high school play .  anne francis ,  also very young ,  fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta ,  whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up .   ( alta morbius ,  now there's a name for you .  )  unfortunately ,  even at this early age ,  anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in 'butterfield 8 . ' there is a good story here ,  buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman's 'cookie , ' ship's cook .   ( holliman turns in a horrendous performance too .  i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school .  )  based on shakespeare's 'the tempest , ' the story of a dead race ,  the krell ,  and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'forbidden planet , ' and for good reason .  for a few minutes here and there ,  you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists' conception of the krell underground complex .  is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings ?  you'll have to decide that on your own .  oh ,  and of course there's robby the robot ,  every 1950's ten-year-old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like .  he's funny .  in places .  so ,  'forbidden planet' to me is a very ,  very mixed bag .  it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and tv shows that followed ,  not least of which was 'star trek . ' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it's more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again . 
robert siodmak does a fabulous job with this b noir starring ella raines ,  franchot tone ,  and alan curtis .  and he does it ,  i might add ,  without a lot of help from his male actors ,  i . e .  ,  curtis and tone .  it's raines all the way ,  a pretty ,  leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her  " noir "  counterparts .   siodmak's use of sex ,  light ,  shadows ,  and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre .  the shadows ,  lighting effects ,  and camera angles are all effective .  but the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by elisha cook ,  egged on by an excited raines .  it's this scene that brings  " phantom lady "  into new territory .   siodmak's commitment to the material is matched only by raines ,  who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man .  franchot tone phoned this one in .  alan curtis didn't seem upset that he might die and didn't seem happy that he lived .  and he never ,  except for a brief moment in prison ,  seemed to be in love with raines .   the amusing thing about many of these films is that ,  as world war ii progressed ,  interest in psychiatry deepened .  but often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as  " possessed ,  "   " spellbound ,  "  and  " the greatest show on earth .  "  tone is called paranoid by thomas gomez - tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder ,  but he appears to be closer to a psychopath .  in actuality ,  as evidenced by his headaches ,  he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain .   phantom lady doesn't have the greatest plot ,  but it's well worth watching . 
late one night on a desolate road ,  in an empty saloon martin sheen spins a yarn for robert carradine of hopalong cassidy and friends tracking a group of murderous cattle rustlers ,  who've killed a few men and kidnapped cassidy's girl .   writer/director christopher coppola may have incurred the wrath of william boyd purists by daring to make a modern low budget film featuring their beloved hoppy ,  but i'm glad he did it !  no character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again !   i thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties .  though guilty of some bad acting ,  this is earnest enough and unpretentious ,  making it hard for me to dislike .   the whole production is a bit odd though ,  but i really enjoyed the scenes between sheen and carridine .  the fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable . 
somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless ,  fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u . s .  treasury agent  ( david morse )  to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief/hacker  ( doug hutchinson )  ,  who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead .    " bait "  marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua  (  " the replacement killers "  )  and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie .  what the two films have in common is the action sequences ,  which are flat-out excellent .   foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning ,  but throughout the film ,  i began to catch on .  hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in  " marathon man "  .  morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost . 
matthew mcconaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent wesley doyle  ( powers boothe )  in his fbi office .  he claims to have information about a serial killer chased by fbi .  when agent doyle arrives in the office ,  he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother .  agent doyle requests some evidence ,  and the man tells the story of his life ,  since his childhood .  they were a simple family of three :  his widow father meiks  ( bill paxton )  ,  his brother and himself .  one night ,  his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of god had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons .  what happens next is one of the most scary movie i have ever seen .    i watched this movie four months ago on vhs ,  and yesterday i watched again ,  now on dvd .  although being a low-budget movie ,  the screenplay is sharp ,  with no flaw .  the cast is outstanding ,  but i would like to highlight the performance of matt o'leary as the young felton .  it is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager .  the direction of bill paxton is remarkable .  there is no explicit violence in this horror movie .  a great debut behind the camera .  i regret the brazilian title of this movie :  'a mão do diabo'  ( the devil's hand' )  .  if at least it were 'the god's hand' ,  it might be acceptable .  but calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous .  brent hanley ,  the screenwriter ,  did not deserve such a lack of respect from the brazilian distributor .  this film is highly recommended .  my vote is eight .   title  ( brazil )  :   " a mão do diabo "   (  " the devil's hand "  ) 
after reading some quite negative views for this movie ,  i was not sure whether i should fork out some money to rent it .  however ,  it was a pleasant surprise .  i haven't seen the original movie ,  but if its better than this ,  i'd be in heaven .   tom cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable david ,  convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs  ( for only the third time in his career- the other examples were magnolia and born on the fourth of july )  .  penelope cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role ,  as does diaz .  the only disappointment is the slightly bland kurt russell .  in the movie ,  however ,  it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking .   cameron crowe excels in the director's role ,  providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick .  the increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by crowe  ( the brief sequence where cruise walks through an empty time square is incredibly effective )  .  the soundtrack  ( a distinguishing feature of a crowe movie )  is also sublime .   you will be shocked and challenged as a viewer .  the plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable .  the movie isn't perfect ,  but its a welcome change of pace for cruise and crowe and for those raised on a diet of hollywood gloss ,  should be a revelation . 
this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made .  it's a real pleaser to anyone .  it'll make you laugh ,  it'll make you cry ,  and it'll put you into suspense .   basically ,  what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation .  they don't know what is going on ,  and desperately wanting to go home ,  they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness .   this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in .  he provided the voice of shadow ,  the old ,  wise and friendly golden retriever .  also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy ,  the himalayan cat .  but seriously ,  what this movie is all about is chance !  voiced by michael j .  fox  ( my all-time favorite actor )  ,  chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog ,  lovable ,  playful ,  energetic and goofy ,  and every time i crack up when watching this movie ,  it's because of chance ;  it's like the comedy never ends !    this movie is also very sad at times .  it sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets .   one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound ;  i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it .  the movie had other suspenseful moments ,  but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one .   overall ,  it's a wonderful family movie .  if you enjoyed this movie ,  you'll probably enjoy the sequel too .  i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 ! 
a really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001-hit  " my sassy girl "  but is able to enchant most of the time .  the biggest applause should go to the two leads .  ha-neul kim is both sweet and quirky ,  sang-woo kwon is both attractive and rebellious .  the chemistry between the two is very good .   director kyeong-hyeong kim uses some cg-inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which sang-woo kwon can shine .  i liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated  " volcano high "  .  and that boy has a future - those looks ,  those fight techniques ,  and a romantic lead .  not bad .   well ,  i can make it short :  nice film .  my rating :  7/10
seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv ,  it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this .  i also think this applies to eva longoria fans .   the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president .  as the investigation unfolds ,  it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete  ( michael douglas )  .  pleading innocence ,  pete goes on the fun ,  fugitive style ,  to search for the truth .   it's solid ,  but certainly not spectacular .  a decent cast ,  a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty ,  but you could certainly do far worse . 
i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville ,  kentucky when i was a boy .  the scene where dr .  carmus finds the gardener's coffin ,  and the breathing dead body therein ,  was the scariest part of the movie for me ,  only intensified by the darkness of the film .  i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end ,  until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood ,  due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people .  sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family .  i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery ,  he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate ,  where he meets his end .  i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers . 
what i expected :  a rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team .   what i got :  an even-handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting -- to themselves and each other -- that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share .   sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works !  barrymore is classic barrymore :  that perfect blend of sweet ,  strong ,  and adorable .  we expect that from her and she delivered .   but fallon is the nice surprise in this film .  he brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life ,  like caring about kids and his girlfriend .  fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection .  he can be caring  (  " you just ran across the field for me !  "  )  and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the red sox  (  " how did the grass feel ?  kinda spongy ?  "  )  at the same time .  fallon's portrayal  " made "  the movie .  hopefully ,  this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for fallon ,  something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of snl alums  ( i . e .  will ferrell )  .   in short ,  a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs .  female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous lines ,  most delivered with brilliant subtlety by fallon .   hey ,  i saw this with my wife -- not a baseball fan -- and she loved it as much as i did .  it's neither a  " guy flick "  nor a  " chick flick "  .  it's a terrific make-you-laugh flick .  go see it ! 
most action films are crass of hindi cinema ,  especially of sunny and his family   the film is typical sunny type with bashes ,  big dialogues and melodrama  the film also has typical rajiv rai ingredients of many henchmen and a weird villain  the starting is okay and then the shift to kenya is good but then the film goes on and on   the sequence of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great happens  they are many stupid scenes like the kenya policemen are shown like jokers especially sharat  the climax too is prolonged  rajiv rai does an okay job music is okay ,  only 1 song works and that is the last toofan camera-work is good  sunny deol is as usual ,  chunky acts like a monkey while his serious scenes are laughable ,  naseer is alright heroines are pure wood amrish puri is not even half as scary as he was in tridev the rest are okay
something that really does not go down right with al gore  ( and his supporters ) 's theory is the whole thing about  " concensus "  .   if there were such a consensus ,  why is it that the  " believers "  in the almighty global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who questions them .   why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of the oil companies  ( apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you're on anyone's payroll in that wondrous world .  .  .  )  why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled ,  when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions ?  for some ideas on the answer to those questions ,  read prey by the well-know oil-stooge michael crichton .  .  .  oh wait ,  he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies .  he just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the greens and other kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it .  by the way did you know that abiding to the kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures ,  according to its own backers ?  just a few questions that al gore made sure to stay away from lest he not get every penny of the environmental lobby in case he decides to run again .   so who's a stooge .  .  ? 
im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you .  this movie is awesome .  from beginning to end ,  it is filled with genuine thrills .  the fight scenes are fantastic ,  the chase scenes are enthralling ,  and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained ,  but that is only because everything that preceded it .  damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor ,  daring you not to believe him in this role .  he is this role .  a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain  ( hope i spelled that close to right )  as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne .  this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way .  some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous ,  thus negating a 10 rating .  the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these ,  for none have been bad .  excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy .   p . s .  the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action ,  but i still think we could do without it .  the good news is ,  you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action . 
where to start ,  this movie started badly and ended badly !  it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat ,  seriously ,  my cat could have acted better than this lot .   some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable ,  i would of rated this lower but they haven't got anything else !  so ,  heed my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission ,  don't bother with this one .  i'm still in shock that this could actually be released to the public ,  this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested .  i gather you've got the gist by now so i'll leave it up to you to decide . 
in the opening scenes of this movie a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights .  this must have been very hep for 1936 ,  but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film ,  robin hood did not make an appearance as far as i could see .  however ,  bette davis ( daisey appleby )  ,  " the whales of august "  , '87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in hollywood .  daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so called swim suit on her yacht with george brent ( johnny jones )  ,  " the spiral staircase "  , '46 .  daisey even proposed marriage to johnny in a ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye .  davis and brent made a great couple ,  one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter .  off stage ,  davis and brent were having a real torrid love affair ,  which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film .  if you liked bette davis and george brent ,  this is the film for you ! 
'iphigenia' is the great achievement of michael cacoyannis .  this masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast .  cacoyannis achieved the impossible .  he managed to film a greek tragedy to screen without losing its effectiveness and importance .  a stellar greek cast helps him in this .  newcomer tatiana papamoschou is extremely impressive as iphigenia .  equally impressive is irene papas  , who even though she sometimes seems over the top ,  it is very realistic .  a wonderful greek film ,  beautifully adapted and directed by michael cacoyannis ,  with an excellent music score by mikis theodorakis which is ideal in every scene .   p . s .  rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film oscar by only 1 vote !  !  ! 
why is it that any film about cleopatra ,  the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making ?  whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all ,  julius ceasar ,  and his successor ,  mark anthony ,  never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors .  despite lavish sets and costumes ,  this movie is as bad as any italian  " sandals and toga "  extravaganza of the 50's .  admittedly ,  this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen ,  which is why  " gladiator "  went over well ,  but  " gladiator "  did not have all the romance novel sex .   miss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor ,  but timothy dalton has talent to spare .  pity some of it didn't wash off on the others . 
this video nasty was initially banned in britain ,  and allowed in last november without cuts .   it features the playboy playmate of the month october 1979 ,  ursula buchfellner .  the opening cuts back and forth between buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures .  i am not sure what the purpose of that was .  it would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene .   laura  ( buchfellner )  is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom .  peter  ( al cliver - the beyond ,  zombie )  is sent to find her and the ransom .  of course ,  one of the kidnappers  ( antonio de cabo )  manages to pass the time productively ,  while another  ( werner pochath )  whines incessantly .   the ransom exchange goes to hell ,  and laura runs into the jungle .  will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal ?  oh ,  yes ,  there are cannibals in this jungle .  why do you think it was a video nasty !  muriel montossé is found by peter and his partner  ( antonio mayans - angel of death )  on the kidnapper's boat .  montossé is very comfortably undressed .  peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura ,  who has been captured by now .  they pass the time having sex ,  and don't see the danger approaching .  guts ,  anyone ?  great fight between peter and the naked devil  ( burt altman )  .   blood ,  decapitation ,  guts ,  lots of full frontal ,  some great writhing by the cannibal priestess  ( aline mess )  ,  and the line ,   " they tore her heart out ,  "  which is hilarious if you see the film . 
this movie raises a number of pressing questions in my mind .  firstly ,  how has jennifer tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs ?  secondly .  .  .  what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of ?  and thirdly .  .  .  given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this ,  shouldn't there have been someone in the system - the studio ,  the distributors ,  or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released .  you really would have to search a very ,  very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this .  .  .  and it isn't even billed as a horror movie - which ,  inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre ,  it certainly is .  the movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness ,  violence and abuse ,  and has essentially no redeeming features at all .  i'm not actually advocating censorship  ( which i don't believe in )  .  .  .  but i really can't see how anybody could conceivably draw anything positive from watching a film like this . 
i get to the cinema every week or so ,  and regularly check out this site ,  but never before have i felt compelled to comment on a film .   to my all time list of shockingly bad films - last man standing ,  spawn ,  the bone collector - i can now add the drivel that was 'hollow man' .   from the awful opening titles - a ridiculously over-long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti - through to the insulting finale - a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema - this film is dismal ,  and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end .   this isn't just my opinion - it was that of my friends ,  and everyone around us .  when large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller ,  its clear that the film is hopeless .   not only that ,  it was sick too .  the director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film ,  and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked b-movie .  it's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man ,  because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts .  perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible ,  but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved ,  it hardly makes entertaining cinema .   [spoilers follow]  get past the films sick exterior ,  and things are even worse .  whilst kevin bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man' ,  the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by a dire script - do an even better job of being hollow cast .  one long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man ,   " he's finally snapped "  shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion .  this is par for the course ,  and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting .  they pad their way through the lab corridors terrified ,  guns poised ,  but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague .  the lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her ,  and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts ,  even after he drowns the pentagon chief ,   " he drowned in his pool last night "  reports the same female ,  spectacularly failing to put two and two together .   the script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue ,  and the rest is just an a-z of film cliches ,  which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end .   the 'eureka' moment at the computer ,  the female undressing at the window ,  the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers ,  the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices ,  the almost-dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman ,  the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer ,  the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes ,  the falling lift which just stops before hitting them ,  and more than anything else ,  the immortality of the bad guy .   the invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame-thrower ,  electrocuted ,  whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors ,  and then having apparently survived the explosion ,  fireball and total destruction of the labs ,  has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes - by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches .   that this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding .  even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself ,  and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one ,  which should be avoided at all costs . 
seven pounds ,  this was the movie where i was just convinced will smith is really going for the  " i'm going to make you cry "  films .  one thing i can give him a ton of credit for ,  the man can cry .  my only thing is ,  as moving as the story is ,  will smith has proved time and time again that he can act ,  so why is he taking this extremely depressing story ?  but nevertheless it's still a good movie .  i do have to admit it made me cry ,  but i felt that the stand out performance was rosario dawson ,  i absolutely love this girl ,  ever since i saw her in 25th hour with ed norton ,  i knew this girl was going to go far .  she's beautiful ,  charming ,  funny and talented ,  can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go .  but her and will smith ,  not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film .   two years ago tim thomas was in a car crash ,  which was caused by him using his mobile phone ;  seven people died :  six strangers and his fiancée .  a year after the crash ,  and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer ,  tim donates a lung lobe to his brother ,  ben ,  an irs employee .  six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named holly .  after that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations .  he finds george ,  a junior hockey coach ,  and donates a kidney to him ,  and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named nicholas .  two weeks before he dies he contacts holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help .  she suggests connie tepos ,  who lives with an abusive boyfriend .  tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish .  one night ,  after being beaten ,  connie contacts tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house .  she takes her two children and moves in to their new home .  having stolen his brother's credentials ,  and making himself known by his brother's name ben ,  he checks out candidates for his two final donations .  the first is ezra turner ,  a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano .  tim calls ezra turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger .  ezra remains calm and tim decides he is worthy .  he then contacts emily posa ,  a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type .  he spends time with her ,  weeding her garden and fixing her rare heidelberg printer .  he begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation .   seven pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look ,  i would just recommend going for the rental vs .  the theater .  will smith pulls in a good performance ,  but not his best ,  just most of the film required him crying in every scene ,  but the last one with him is a doozy .  but i loved the ending ,  it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted .  there is still good people in this world and ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need .  although he went a little far ,  but it was still a beautiful story .   7/10
this series just gets worse and worse .  poorly written and just plain not funny !  the premise is excellent ,  but the writer's inexperience shines through .  by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone .  now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about ,  and resorted to that patronizing ,  smug ,   " oh ,  silly you "  style acting that comes with a no laugh script .  they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say ,  aren't we zany ?  isn't this funny ?  well ,  no ,  it's not actually .  gum disease is less painful .  no wonder ,  with the exception of corner gas ,  canadians generally avoid canadian tv .  come on cbc you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent .  pull the plug on this amateurish mess . 
the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns .  christopher lee  ( who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved )  is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine .  the cast are not too bad ,  though most have now retired from acting .  the film has terrible sound effects  ( mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems )  and it ridiculously pondering at times - showing a scene of the sky ,  for instance ,  for what feels like hours at a time .  despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world-is-doomed sort of way and the production is adequate .  interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie ;  meda band ;  writer frank ray perilli and charles band's assistant bennah burton .  despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it . 
i never watched the 'next action hero' show ,  and until reading the other comments here ,  did not know that this movie was the 'prize' from that competition .  i was just flipping channels and came across this ,  and found myself watching ,  dare eagerly ,  all the way to the end .   yes ,  the plot's been done  ( the most dangerous game ,  etc .  )  but i was hoping for ,  and almost received ,  the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end .  i think the high-tech was overdone  ( gps's )  and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of night rider ,  but it nevertheless was not too overdone .   the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod  ( suspension of disbelief )  that was required of the viewer .  do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate ?  could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up ?  pleeease .  way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch ,  but keep it at least plausible ,  thank you very much .   the final solution was good ,  but the ending was disappointing ,  with the after taste of a bad star trek episode .  at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for zane ,  who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves imho - they were winners from a reality show .   knock me out . 
 " national lampoon goes to the movies "  is the worst movie ever made ,  surpassing even the witless  " plan 9 from outer space .  "  at least that movie was just inept ;  the lampoon film ,  on the other hand ,  is both inept and mean .  once upon a time ,  movies used to respect their audiences' intelligence .  this one ,  however ,  holds a fetid ,  rotting carcass up to our faces -- and then tries to rub our noses in it .   another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes ;  and i agree ,  misses ganzel and dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh ,  and very nice flesh it is .  but the directors seem not to realize that even t&a needs a good story to surround it .  there's none of that here .   perversely ,  the film makers save the worst for last .  the third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio .  in this vignette ,  robby benson plays an eager-beaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job .  he is paired with a weary ,  cynical oldtimer played by richard widmark .  for just a moment ,  we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly .  surely ,  we think ,  the youngster's spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better .   forlorn hope !  instead ,  the cynic wins the day -- and the youngster's spark is doused forever .   " national lampoon goes to the movies "  and heads right for the toilet ,  asking us to follow it down the drain .  nominally ,  this is a comedy .  but where's the humor ? 
i did not watch the entire movie .  i could not watch the entire movie .  i stopped the dvd after watching for half an hour and i suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case .   i like mafia movies both tragic and comic but corky romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy .   the problem is corky romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh ,  the plot seems to be an excuse for moving chris kattan  ( corky )  from one scene to another .  corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity - all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived - chris kattan is clearly 'acting' rather than taking a role - it bounces you right out of the story .  each scene is utterly predictable ,  the 'comedic event' that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced .  in comedies such as mr .  bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathise with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not telegraphed .  corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience .   if chris had not played such an alien character  ( who never really connects with the other characters in the movie )  and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable  ( except for trying to draw laughs )  and the comedy scenes weren't so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed far too familiar )  this movie could have been watchable .  but it isn't .  don't watch it . 
visconti's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique ,  accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and ,  best of all ,  clara calamai as the fabulous ,  frantic giovanna .  remade several times as 'the postman rings twice' but never bettered .  can't believe this was the man's first film !  it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career . 
have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon ?  oh ,  you have ?  was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds ,  and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey ?  did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon ?  i didn't think so .   i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i'm really glad that i did !  it's one of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen .  much like the pixar movies ,  it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world .  the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen ,  and this attention to detail is staggering  ( the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites )  .  the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action .   although the plot may not be entirely unique ,  the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching .  our protagonists are likable and interesting ,  ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path .  of course ,  hector is the character most will fall in love with .  a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english ,  hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar binks could only dream of .   in summary ,  i'd recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity .  watch it for the incredible animation ,  the breath-taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike anything else you've seen on a cinema or television screen .  at the very least ,  it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you're nine or twenty-nine  ( which ,  in fact ,  i am )  ! 
the first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on  ( unless you read the book - which i had not )  .   if you can stick with the first half ,  the second half is sweet - predictable ,  yes ,  but sweet none-the-less .   the way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80's ,  not 2005 .   no stand-out moments ,  bland ,  but it moved along without boring me .   i would like to know why keaton selected this role ,  her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance . 
i see a lot of movies .  saw the original wargames years ago and loved it .  computers where still  " a big mystery "  for the most of us and the movie was convincing ,  in it's own way .   this one ,  however ,  looks like a low budget wednesday night special .  total crap ,  from start to finish .   the plot is so weak ,  you won't believe it until you see the movie  ( which i would not recommend in the first place )  .  i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie .  but hey ,  with that script i would've been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting .  lots of cliché scenes .  cgi looks like it's taken out of the '86 version .   bah ,  no ,  i'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this .  do not watch this movie .   life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies . 
at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it .  in all honesty ,  my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie .  and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman ,  when a new version of that just came out .  .  . nice touch guys ,  it was misleading enough to rope me in .  the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut .  usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it .  the film looks like it was shot by a d+ grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes .  .  .  . sometimes ,  less is more buddy .  through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained .  all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn't even come close to pulling it together ,  well ,  that makes it an exceptionally bad movie .  without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen ,  and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school ,  but hey maybe i'm a bit biased ,  i mean i did get to play an extra .  p . s .  i don't even think this deserves a star .  .  . not even a half .  none for you !  ! 
it's been a while since i've watched this movie ,  and the series ,  but now i'm refreshing my memory !  this was a very funny movie based on the classic series !  johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together .  bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee .  when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm ,  bo and luke sneak around hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal .  they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip-mine hazzard county ,  unless the dukes can stop him ,  with the help of their beautiful cousin ,  daisy .  my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss hogg ,  and sheriff rosco p .  coltrane was way too serious .  other than that ,  i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard !  !  ! 
 .  .  . and that's why hard to rate .    from the adult point of view  ( hmm ,  student point of view :  )  )  .  i must say i fell nearly asleep here .  sure ,  there is some laughing scene  ( all the credit takes here eddie )  ,  but that can't save the disney type of script and whole movie ,  that's why  2 out of 10
bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show ,  and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent  " hey hollywood - look how good i can act !  "  box office disappointments .  it's great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths .  he won't get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the  " awarded films "  of the academy .  he is at the top of his form in this most recent film - it's like the return of an old friend .   carrey ,  freeman ,  and aniston all do a great job together - comfortable in their comedy roles ,  superb comic timing ,  and obviously having fun together but without the  " hey mom - look how funny i am "  type of comedy .  a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey's nemesis  ( carrell of the daily show fame )  ,  who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film .  i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years .   i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up-in-arms over the treatment of god ,  but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will .  without married with children t o complain about ,  this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities  ( who know the types - men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television ,  selling prayers to god )  .  and ,  again ,  about 0 . 5% of the country will care and 80% of the media will report it .   the bottom line :  this a purely entertaining film ,  each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do ,  and a feel-good feeling at the movie conclusion .  a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor .  what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry .   thanks again ,  jim -- it's great to have you back !  ! 
it sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings .  by using the adjective 'shocking' i do not intend to imply that i am surprised about the things told about in this film or that i was formerly unaware of them ,  it is just that i am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off ,  either with or without a 'reason' .   the first part of the film focuses on hanna's successful participation in the hungarian resistance .  maruschka detmers would never have won an oscar for this performance ,  due to inconsistent directing ,  but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma .  she is cast very well as hanna and immediately has our sympathy .  her very beautiful looks help ,  of course ,  but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress ,  playing a good part .   certain inconsistencies keep occurring in hanna's war .  i sometimes get the idea director menahem golan  ( often despised for the gianni versace murder )  was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene .  on the other hand ,  i am very thankful he made this impressive and thought-provoking film and as i am very positive about it ,  i think he did a good job .   the second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one .  it focuses on hanna's suffering  ( beware of donald pleasence's scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain rosza )  and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war .  i receive hanna's war ,  especially the second half ,  as a strong anti-war film and for that alone golan deserves credit .  it is also this second half in which maruschka detmer's talent comes out ,  creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking ,  strong and tragic ever portrayed .  it is also great to see ellen burstyn ,  whose appearance and acting style always remind me of romy schneider ,  who -had she been alive and cast- would have made a similar effective contribution to hanna's war .   the tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected ,  so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears .  and when i realized once more it wasn't even fiction ,  it all actually happened ,  i found myself in even more tears .  the image of hanna portrayed by maruschka detmers will be in my mind forever . 
i don't understand why making remakes has become the trend .  every remake i have ever seen is awful ,  and this is no exception .  if any of you have seen the quote from ben jones ,  that it is a  " sleazy "  piece of trash ,  he is quite right .  why they would take a wonderful television show ,  which i loved ,  have never missed an episode ,  and own seasons 1-4 on dvd ,  and ruin it ,  i'll never know .  the television show was a family show ,  and although daisy has the body ,  it was really flaunted ,  or even addressed in the show ,  save the outfits .  a family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage ,  and i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it .  another thing i didn't like was that john schneider and tom wopat are excellent actors  ( along with the rest of the original cast )  ,  and they are also extremely cute .  the new bo and luke are not even a little cute .  that was one of the drawers for the show .  the casting is terrible .  they could have at least gotten a brunette for daisy .  i don't think burt reynolds is a qualified boss hogg ,  either .  every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role .  the only role they cast halfway decent is willie nelson as uncle jesse ,  but still it is no comparison .  denver pyle is an actor all his own ,  and that made him perfect for the role .  i think that the casting is awful ,  the story is awful ,  and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty ,  terrible movie .  i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it .  i only saw it out of curiosity ,  plus there was a free ticket in season 4 dvd .  i would never have paid to see this movie ,  but it was free .  don't pay to see this movie . 
after 30 seconds ,  you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock-off .  the story is taken from great movies like  " texas chainsaw massacre "  and  " hills have eyes "  .  i like those kind of movies ,  even if they're duplicated well  ( wrong turn ,  timber falls ,  carver )  .    but  " side sho "  is hard to watch :  the actors are really bad ,  the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced .  you do not care at all what happens to the characters .  the so-called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical .  so how about the blood and gore  ?  well there is some ,  although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly .  2 points ,  just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look ,  even for the gore-hounds .  . 
classic ,  highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director carpenter and star curtis .   seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on halloween .   halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece !  carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt !  the direction often consists of such simple elements ,  shadows ,  dark streets ,  creaking doors ,  that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy .  carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling ,  that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage !  plus ,  he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong .  highest kudos also go to carpenter's simple ,  yet frighteningly unnerving music score .  in a sense ,  halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film !   the cast is excellent .  young jamie lee curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter laurie strode ,  she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films .  the great donald pleasants does a perfect performance as a myer's doctor ,  who's desperate to capture him again .  supporting cast loomis ,  soles ,  castle ,  and others are good too .   so like its own villain ,  halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill .  it is a must for all genre fans !   **** out of ****
your attitude going into prom night ii will determine how much joy you take away from the film .  if you're expecting a horror masterpiece ,  look elsewhere .  if you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold ,  you'll like this .  lisa schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top mary lou and wendy loyd channels schrage's rage perfectly during her time  " possessed "  .   not classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending .   
okay ,  i know this does'nt project india in a good light .  but the overall theme of the movie is not india ,  it's shakti .  the power of a warlord ,  and the power of a mother .  the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth .  then things go terribly wrong .  the interaction between nandini and her father in law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie .  shah rukh khan's performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor .  it is easy to get caught up in the love ,  violence and redemption of lives in this film ,  and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax .  the musical interludes are strengths ,  believable and well done . 
this movie has some beautiful sets and albert finney does a great job as the ruthless father .  the movie fails because jennifer jason leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for olivia de havilland's far more nuanced ,  mature rendering in the heiress  ( 1949 )  .  the film's feminist-leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel ,  washington square ,  whose author ,  henry james ,  savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels .  as a fan of old hollywood and great literature ,  i found this movie very disappointing . 
well the main reason i tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by trey parker and matt stone of south park fame .  however as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly .  from the subtle gestures towards a joke ,  to the blatant toilet humour throughout ,  along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo .  this film could ruin event he sternest mans poker face ,  let alone his poker underwear .  some of the funniest blink and you'll miss it jokes ever portrayed in hollywood ,  along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain .   i just goes to show that not only is trey parker adept at writing he's not too shabby at the old acting game either .  i was surprised with the amount that i was absorbed in this film .  however i'm quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet ,  here in the uk .  sort it out boys !   i am ,  and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits ,  and occasionally snorting into my lager .  all in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy .  however if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear !  however i'm sure the inclusion of jenny mccarthy and jasmine bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices . 
when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb ,  but it will at least be funny .  well i was wrong .  even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life ,  the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible .  the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny .  but by the end ,  i could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next .   throughout the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre ,  which is still more than i can say for the movie itself . 
i saw  " a page of madness "  in a silent film course at wesleyan university and it haunts me still after 25 years .  truly ahead of its time - perhaps even still - this gem of a film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness . 
spoiler alert !  this movie ,  zero day ,  gives an inside to the lives of two students ,  andre and calvin ,  who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything associated with there school .   they go on a series of self-thought out  " missions "  all leading up to the huge mission ,  which is zero day .  zero days contents are not specified until the middle to the end of the movie .  the viewer knows its serious and filled with hate but is never quite sure until the end .   now we all know ,  if the movie is based on the columbine massacre ,  the ending is pretty obvious .  and the ending is no different than any other movie about the attack ,  they go and kill many of their fellow students in the end .   i have seen a lot of movies on this attack ,  and this movie by far is my favorite ,  and most respected .  it gives the viewer and inside look to the lives of these two teens who hate life ,  and honestly it gives the viewer some what of an understanding ,  and a closure on the horrible event .   being only 7 when the events played out ,  i never knew the seriousness of the shootings ,  until my english class was assigned an essay or story on a defining moment in our generation .  well i knew everyone was going to pick the twin towers ,  but i wanted to be different ,  because of course the twin towers was tragic and very defining ,  but i didn't think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way of relating to that because ,  i was only in the 3rd grade and i had no idea what it all meant .  but the shootings did leave and effect .  i remember the interviews ,  the sky views of the school ,  and the hurt and terror in the eyes of thousands of people .   this movie is a compelling ,  down to earth ,  and horrific masterpiece ,  and i would reccomened it to anyone . 
i sought out a copy of the forest because i was watching a vh1 special ,  i think  " where are they now "  ,  and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor corky pigeon .  he played the male child ghost in this b horror horrible ,  but i remember him from his character freddy on the silver spoons television show .  this flick's a major letdown .  there's nothing here .  it actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish .  i kept stopping it in boredom ,  setting it aside and forgetting about it ,  then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it .  obviously ,  the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element ,  the apparitions .  and obviously ,  here ,  that doesn't work .  i can't stand the male leads .  i kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines .  the situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb .  i guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg ,  you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh .  it's fairly good gore makeup there .  man ,  i'm really reaching for a positive now ,  huh .  the only other no-budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be home sweet home . 
i should explain why i gave this .  .  .  " piece of art "  1 star rating out of possible 10 .  simply because it's hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased .  probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10/10 - explanations anyway would have followed .   i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so - i think that's disgusting and pretty terrible  ( in all the possible contextual meanings )  ,  but as i found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called  " historical drama "  - and probably it would have been the case of 10/10 as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it  ( and made kill bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible )  .  but the thing about  " historical drama "  genre is that it's a sub-category of the  " trash movies "  where john romero is the undead-gory-emperor-of-the-guts and so automatically it can't be rated as your default movie - as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you can't really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so ,  or it was simply bad .  it's for the people who like to enjoy bad acting ,  bad screenplay and bad everything else .  and by some turn of faith - i am one of them too .  there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go - the day is saved !  but that's definitely an opinion of mine and doesn't have match with anyones' else .   what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie - then fellini's casanova is definitely the choice ,  but heed my advice and don't rate it by default means . 
what a perfect example of  " less is more .  .  .  "  kurt russell  ( sgt .  todd )  only has 72 lines ,  and something like 104 words .  what a challenge !  like a black and white photo ,  when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks ,  the facial expressions ,  the physical drama ,  the emotive gesture ,  all combines to make a stronger impact .  this is one of those top 5 movies i can't live without ,  right up there with the classics like road warrior .  if you liked this ,  check out  " mad max 2 ,  the road warrior "  and  " braveheart "  both starring mel gibson .  also  " gladiator "  with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also .  the  " thirteenth warrior "  starring antonio banderas and  " blade runner "  starring harrison ford . 
fassbinder's most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of suffering in long ,  mobile takes that somehow also act as social encapsulations ;  here ,  it's much more overt ,  since the story takes place in war-torn germany at the end of wwii ,  and the central character is a woman  ( hanna schygulla as maria )  who capitalizes on vulnerabilities  ( both economic and gender-related )  to catapult herself up the ladder of a prominent textile corp .  that makes coveted goods like lederhosen available to indigent workers  ( as she once was )  .  married amidst allied air raids ,  maria and her new husband herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he's shipped out to the russian front .  in his absence ,  her despair is great :  she spends most days at the train station ,  waiting for him to return .  when he is reported dead ,  she abruptly stops grieving and takes a job as a barmaid/prostitute at a brothel catering to american gi's .   when he returns ,  things get plenty messy ,  as circumstances  ( and his sense of noble self-sacrifice )  conspire to keep them apart .  the message is fassbinder's m . o .  writ large :  'love is colder than death , ' but not only is maria contending with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her ,  but a country in deep flux with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel .  fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post-war germany selling out to the highest bidder ,  but as with all his films ,  i tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display :  fassbinder's as evoked through his characters ;  his actors' as filtered through their real-life connections with fassbinder .  taken together ,  his films can be either unbearable or indescribably mesmeric ,  often at once ;  this falls somewhere in-between ,  although definitely closer to the latter .  while i didn't like it quite as much as the bitter tears of petra von kant or katzelmacher ,  maria braun certainly has a greater scope and what's more ,  i could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions . 
let's cut to the chase :  if you're a baby-boomer ,  you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that ,  in 1976 ,  mccartney had the gumption to drop in on john's city hermit life and spend the day with him .  you also certainly wondered how things went .  i heard the exact same reports that the writer of this film heard ,  from john's and paul's perspective ,  and i admit that i reconstructed the meeting in pretty much the same way this film does .  but none of my imaginings could have bought tears to my eyes the way this incredible piece of work and acting does .  i found it amazingly lifelike ,  perfectly plausible and 100 % saccharin-free .  now ,  can anyone explain why i didn't hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the cbc last night ?  i mean it's already three years old ,  for goodness sake !  and yes ,  if you're a beatles fan ,  this is a must-see performance !  even the subtle paraphrasing of beatles' melodies in the background is inspired . 
read on and take note - you could save 88 minutes of your life  ( was that all !  )  .   unremittingly bleak ,  this film sets out to produce  ( i'm guessing )  a modern small town american christmas fable in the capra style .  if fails .  .  .  . completely and absolutely fails .  i've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't .  let me mention some of the highlights  .  .  .   people don't die ,  they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in santa's factory .  angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit in trees .  santa can bring people back from the dead  ( if you send him a nice letter )  .    and the plot .  .  i won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any .  even the photography is bleak - snow shown at the end of a freeze ,  everywhere looking cold ,  damp and miserable .    as you might guess ,  the film has a happy  ( schmaltzy )  ending .  what a relief  ! 
richard brooks excellent 1967 film of truman capote's novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffman's oscar winning performance in the 2005 capote .  they really play well together  ( try them on separate nights )  .  it is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well .  these two truly enhance each other .  even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock ,  the two pieces blend well .  only the part of the writer  ( played by paul stewart )  in the brooks films is weaker ,  as they give him a different name then capote .  i'd suggest watching capote first ,  followed by in cold blood .  it makes for a powerful experience ! 
i'd have to say this is one of the best animated films i've ever seen .  i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing ,  just a few weeks ago .  i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office .  apparently ,  a lot of people liked this movie .   a gorgeous color palette  ( man ,  this looks good )  and a lot of good adult  ( but clean )  humor make this a big winner .  the opening 3-4-minute scene with  " scat ,  "  is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him .   " sid "  the sloth  ( voiced by john leguizano )  ,  however ,  provides the main humor in the movie .  he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie .   ray romano is the voice of the mammoth ,  the big character of the film ,  literally ,  while denis leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger  this isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice ,  sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters .  this isn't interrupted with a lot of songs ,  either :  one only brief one and there is nothing offensive ,  language-wise .   if more animated movies were this good ,  i'd own more . 
film makeovers of old tv shows seems to be the norm in hollywood these days ,  but this disrespectful ,  toilet humor ,  do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth foul language ,  rip-off is a blatant middle finger to all dukes of hazzard fans both north and south of the mason-dixon line .  from the opening sequence of bo and luke duke making a moonshine run for uncle jesse  ( no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation )  to the closing sequence of uncle jesse smoking weed with the governor of georgia  ( uncle jesse was the moral compass despite his previous moonshining ways )  this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult .  i can't tell you how many parents i saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly deceived .  the original dukes of hazzard was a family show with basic moral values .  the original dukes of hazzard was a kid safe ,  hemi powered ,  show of fun that parents didn't have to worry about teaching their kids george carlin's seven words .  i have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist .  those commits might be correct about the movie .  those commits are absolutely incorrect about the show .  the show ,  if anything ,  was about how to get along and be friends with anyone .  hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us ,  yankee ,  rebel ,  or otherwise ,  who still believe in honor ,  loyalty ,  trust ,  family ,  and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing .  hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid ,  uneducated ,  beer swilling ,  foul mouthed ,  trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell .  prove the hollywood elitist that they are wrong .  do not go see this movie .  boycott the sponsors .  fill warner bros .  email and snail mail boxes with complaints that we don't appreciate them destroying one of the greatest t . v .  shows of all time .  save your money and buy the dvd's of the original show ,  but whatever you do do not go see this movie
there are three kinds of bad films - the cheap ,  the boring ,  and the tasteless .  the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless .    boring films are just ,  well ,  boring - if you don't leave quickly enough ,  you fall asleep .   tasteless films actually have their defenders ;  but the fact remains that they are masturbatory aids for very sick people .   only the cheap bad films are really funny ,  because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperately ,  they way-over-reached beyond their abilities and available resources .   bo derek is just naturally boring and tasteless ;  fortunately ,  fate and a lack of funds and skill redeem her by making her seem cheap as well .  this film is hilarious and it may well be the last really funny-bad film ever made .   i first saw this in a theater ,  may god forgive me ;  i was laughing so hard i was rolling off my seat ,  and so too with most of the rest of the audience .   it's clear that derek and her husband-promoter ,  conceived of this film as ,  partly ,  a satire ;  unfortunately ,  the dereks clearly lacked any of the necessary resources to pull that off ;  consequently ,  the 'satirical' element comes off as some school-girl's impression of some gay young man's impression of frank gorshin's impression of the riddler in batman trying to pretend he's robin - it doesn't fly over our heads ,  it has no clue where any human head might be .   on the other hand ,  there are some supposedly serious moments in this film - it is supposed to be an action film ,  remember - that are so astoundingly cheesy ,  one wonders if someone squirted spoiled milk in one's eye .   as for derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts - i can't imagine a less erotic nudity photographic display ,  she is so weird looking with those broad shoulders ,  i can't imagine what any one ever saw in her .   as for the plot - such as it is - well ,  it isn't ;  derek chases around africa ,  and god alone knows why .  then her father - harris - pretends to act in some maniacal puppet-show ,  and then of course there's the hunk'o'tarzan that seems to have wondered in from advertisement without knowing that the subject's changed - probably because he hasn't seen a script - apparently no one has .   negligible camera work ,  shoddy editing - if it weren't for the 3-way with the chimp ,  the film would be unbearable -  as it is ,  it's a real hoot . 
the last command  ( 1928 )  is a silent film directed by josef von sternberg . it shows us czarist general ,  grand duke sergius alexander  ( emil jannings )  in his days of glory . in 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of imperial russia he has nothing . he also had the love of a woman ,  natalie dabrova  ( evelyn brent )  . about ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution . his old enemy lev andreyev  ( william powell )  is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not . the last command is very good silent drama . emil jannings does memorable role work in the lead . evelyn brent is wonderful playing the woman lead . william powell is great as always . there are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie . like many scenes with jannings and brent . and then there is the ending with powell and jannings . this is a movie that touches in many parts . 
some have praised _atlantis : _the_lost_empire_ as a disney adventure for adults .  i don't think so--at least not for thinking adults .   this script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie ,  that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore .  the  " crack staff "  of many older adventure movies has been done well before ,   ( think _the dirty dozen_ )  but _atlantis_ represents one of the worse films in that motif .  the characters are weak .  even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best .  an md/medicine man ,  a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons ,  if we have not at least seen these before ,  we have seen mix-and-match quirks before .  the story about how one companion ,  vinny played by don novello  ( fr .  guido sarducci )  ,  went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing .   only the main character ,  milo thatch ,  a young atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by michael j .  fox ,  has any depth to him .  milo's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him .  the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee ,  as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head .   and while the characters were thin at best ,  the best part about _atlantis_ was the voice talent .  perhaps milo's depth is no thicker than fox's charm .  commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner .  although rourke is a pretty stock military type ,  garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery .  garner's vocal performance is the high point .  i'm sorry to say leonard nimoy's dying king is nothing more than obligatory .  additionally ,  don novello as the demolition expert ,  vinny santorini ,  was also notable for one or two well-done ,  funny lines--but i've always liked father guido sarducci ,  anyway .    also well done was the computer animation .  the background animation ,  that is .  the character animation has not been this bad for disney since the minimalism that drove don bluth out the door .  the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter .  aside from landscapes ,  buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress .   the plot was the worst .  some say hackneyed or trite .  i'm not so sure about that .  any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment .  shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint .  so the treatment is the thing .  and _atlantis_ obviously lacks that .   i cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section .  the plot was bad .  the plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense .  to add to that ,  the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness .   ** spoilers **  1 .  right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the  " coast of ireland "  should read the  " coast of iceland "  ,  we begin to have problems .  the writers of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as  " ireland "  ,  and completely ignore the older ,  latin term hibernia .  but more than this ,  they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenland .    by making it the matter of a mis-tranliterated  " letter "  ,  the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post-roman date on the script .  since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave .  and without visible clues and less technology than milo had ,  made the inscription far less trustworthy .   2 .  the shepard's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis ,  or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying  " in the king's eye "  .  it must have been written after the sinking ,  but without even the technology that milo's expedition had ,  how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan .  so how could it know more about anything after that ?  and why would it be written in atlantian ?    automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things .  however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in atlantian .  so it's got to be some sort automatic writing .  since noone left in atlantis can read ,  it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface .  this would have made more sense .  but could also have been explained within the movie :  milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life--appeared in dreams ,  etc .  this needed to be explored in the movie .   3 .  the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages .  no-one expects that the original indo-europeans would be able to converse in europe ,  anymore than romans would understand that hard  " c " s or their day became french  " ch " s  ( pronounced like  " sh " s ,  no less !  )   4 .  current atlantians were alive before the cataclysm--when apparently they *could* read ,  yet now are unable to read what they used to ,  or operate similar machinery .    5 .  the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie .  nothing seems to have happened to this culture .  it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it .  even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival ,  no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy .   5 .  kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in--but any of it **hardly** qualifies her father for deification !  !  kashakim's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence .  killed a bunch in the cataclysm ,  stalled progress  ( not a lot killed here ,  but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress )  until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody ,  if they weren't boiled in lava first because the giant robots weren't there to protect them .    a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim's likeness ,  when kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis !    6 .  even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian ,  rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal--which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or  " phases of the sun "  diagram .   7 .  if milo's grandfather had told rourke about it ,  it still does not explain what how rourke would have suffered from milo's reading it as part of the book .  ripping out the page--which was dog-eared in rourke's hand ,  even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently--only was there to tip off the viewer that  " something was not quite right "  .  unless the word  " crystal "  would have set alarms off in milo's head that somebody would try to steal it ,  milo would have suspected nothing .  it's just thick-headed foreshadowing .   8 .  the crew's  " double-cross "  was not a character change .  we learned that vinny ,  sweet ,  audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning .  however ,  the  " change of heart "  falls flat .  it was a change ,  and needed to be better motivated .  hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with .   9 .  niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome ,  instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from .  it's liquid ;  it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas .   10 .  the ending stinks ! -- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness .  with it's powersource restored ,  atlantis is no longer a weak power ,  needing coddling .  the giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might .  the technology is superior to ours ,  and definitely to early 20th-century .  in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read ,  for what ?  the whole idea is to leave their little quiet ,  chastened culture alone ,  not to send it into hyperdrive .    ** end spoilers **  perhaps ,  the lost world plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps .  the failures i find with the film agree with this idea .  but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well .  and pulp stories is part of the  " crap they can't sell adults anymore "  ,  anyway .  we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well .  raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness .   4 out of 10--the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot ,  it seeps ever lower . 
this is a rather tame fluff piece concerning ww ii codes being broken ,  stolen ,  etc .  the acting is about what i expected from this cast of mgm  " b "  actors .   one big caution .  jean rogers ,  who did such a great job playing the very sexy dale arden in the first two flash gordon serials is just awful in this movie .  her character is extremely annoying .  she absolutely never lets-up with her overacting .  we are supposed to believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a top secret code facility ,  she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function .  from that standpoint i'm sorry that i ever watched this film .  it has forever changed my perception of ms .  rogers .  talentwise ,  she is an extreme lightweight .   lee bowman is his usual self ,  meaning that he is merely adequate .   
this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy ,  for a variety of reasons .  however it emerges at the end of the day a winner ,  despite all its flaws .  it's still a very good film ,  even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments .   one problem here is the look of the film ,  which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films .  i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz .  the first 2 films have that dirty ,  lived-in look with all the technology and so forth .  in  " jedi "  on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned .  this makes for a much less textured film .  also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy .  at this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself .   another aspect is its lack of originality .  where  " star wars "  created a whole new experience in cinema and  " empire "  brought us to alien worlds of swamps ,  ice ,  and clouds ,   " jedi "  lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film .  first we are back on the desert planet tatooine ,  and then we are watching them face another death star  ( maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new .  .  .  but you'd think lucas or kasdan could )  .  also we have these ewoks ,  who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears ,  in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of  " star wars "  if they hadn't run out of cash .  it just feels like lazy construction .   the most unfortunate aspect of  " jedi "  for me is the weak handling of the han solo character .  whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time ,  trading one liners with the droids .  instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke -- as if the conclusion of  " empire "  where she confessed her love of him had never happened .  the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue .  ford ,  for his part ,  looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances .  this is more like a 1990s ford performance ,  bored and looking  " above "  the film itself .  fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes .  lando ,  an interesting character introduced in  " empire "  ,  here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle .  only hamill ,  given an interesting development in the luke character ,  is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character .  probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work .  and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters .  really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package .  ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor .  the film would sink if he had been too far over the top  ( as he was at times in the new films )  .   visually and in terms of effects work ,  other than the  " clean "  look of everything it's hard to find fault .  jabba is a very effective animatronic character ,  one of the most elaborate ever constructed .  the space battles towards the end are very impressive .   ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears .  but on its own ,  it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas' later productions . 
the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget  " halestorm entertainment "  has had to work with .  all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash .  not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful ,  but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best .  the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc .  the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing .  i think just because i couldn't believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the  " film "  . 
the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi .  karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others ,  even his wife .  his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid .   lugosi plays the consummate professional ,  who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone ,  but still seems to have no real close friends .  this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well .  it is hard ,  however to hear his accent and believe he is french .    the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on  " junk science "  but ,  in a way ,  even the junk science makes it work well .  since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic ,  they are as  " relevant "  today as they were when the movie was made .  and they are also as forward reaching- and always will be .    this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again .  i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times .  the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing .  i highly recommend it . 
loaded with fine actors ,  i expected much more from  " deceiver "  than was delivered .  the plot is extremely contrived and manipulative .  the many flashbacks only add to the confusion .  believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous .  i would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid  " deceiver "  because you will be very frustrated .  maybe i am just not hip enough to get it ,  but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending .  blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense .  - merk
this tim burton remake of the original  " planet of the apes "  from 1968  ( and starring charleton heston )  is a far ,  far cry from the quality and plot of the original .   certainly special effects have improved since 1968 ,  but writing has not .  the characters were boring and the dialog was awful .  i sat through the entire film with a friend  ( who thankfully only rented it )  and completely understood why ,  before christmas ,  all of the  " planet of the apes "  toys at target were in the clearance bin .   my advice to tim burton :  don't put this on your resume .   my advice to everyone else :  watch the original 1968  " planet of the apes "  movie . 
ain't it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him ,  turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way ?  that formula never gets old ,  does it ?  it's such a sure fire way to make a classic film !  just look at major hits like liar liar and big !  .  .  .  this must have been rob schneider's line of thinking when he made semi-successful deuce bigalow :  male gigolo and followed it with the animal .  since i've already traced the plot through sarcasm ,  allow me to color it in more :  schneider plays a loser cop who's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery .  .  .  by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts ,  causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times ,  run like a cheetah ,  etc .  this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider-starring flicks  ( such as another lame same-plot follow-up the hot chick )  ,  but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead  ( colleen haskell from  " survivor "  )  and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald .  my favorite scene .  .  .  just does not exist .  sorry - nothing memorably good except the production value .  i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay ,  but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way  (  " you can do it !  "  )  ,  there's a word for that -  " milking .  "  actually ,  here's another word -  " cheap .  " 
the film is very complete in what it is ,  keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father ,  and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder ,  one simply cannot go wrong .  the very plot in itself ,  the very story and essence of the film ,  is entertaining .  it is the sort of story that the director  ( bill paxton )  could do so much with ,  and in this case ,  he really did do a lot with it .   from beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going ,  and the creativity that is behind this story is first class .  i felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish ,  and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls -- the action flowing neatly ,  quickly ,  and tightly from one scene to the next .    it demonstrates just how far people can go :  so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones ,  and to do such acts of evil ,  in the name of 'god' when they are disillusioned as in this case .  it also is sometimes interesting in its' twists & takes on the concept of morality as a whole .   overall ,  this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks ,  but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out -- it is very much so worth your time . 
a broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent  ( tom wood and arye gross )  are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager  ( ron perlman )  whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city ,  the  " costume killer "   ( so named because ,  after injecting his victims with windex ,  he dresses them in silly costumes )  .  they convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers  ( john considine ,  joe pantoliano ,  kristy swanson )  and discover that the art of movie making can be murder .   there is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows  ( rumor is the studio wanted a  " lighter "  dark comedy )  .  our loss  ( and the actors ,  who all do fine jobs and deserve better )  as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute .   if you're a ron perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance .  his comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions  ( he wasn't kidding when he said on the hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into jerry lewis mode )  .  he's just simply fun to watch in this one .    david dukes also shines in a two-scener  ( but pivotal )  role . 
the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series !  mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama !  i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters !  explaining just enough to stay excited !  of course this show has some flaws !  in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season !  many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there !  like rose and her husband !  where the hell are they ?  what happened to them ?  maybe they will return in later episodes !  but it is a little inconsistent !  that being said  " lost "  manages to be thrilling every episode ( especially the first two seasons )  !  that is a very hard thing to do !  i do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show !  this is not a bad thing !  it even saves some episodes from getting boring !  one of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters !  you will grow to love these characters !  good or bad !  but eventually i will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure !  the danger of  " lost "  getting canceled due to declining ratings is near !  and that would be devastating ! 
this is truly terrible :  painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose ,  no beginning ,  middle or end ,  cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention ,  all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable  " story "  .  what makes it worse is the film's pretentions to  " style "  :  suddenly a remote-head crane shot spirals downwards ,  and ,  without any apparent reason there are sudden whip-pans or wobblyhand-held sections :  all this  " style "  merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material .  definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made . 
so ,  american pie :  beta house is the 6th american pie movie in the series .  although ,  it really has nothing to do with the original three american pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and eugene levy is in it  ( can't that guy get better gigs ?  )  .   there is very little to compliment this movie on .  there aren't any funny jokes .  the acting is painful to watch ,  especially the girl with the  " southern "  accent which sounds more like a canadian's impersonation of a british woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word  " ya'll .  "  this movie makes me feel like such an idiot .  why didn't i apply to a college where nobody goes to class  ( but everybody gets good grades )  ,  girls consistently take their clothes off in public ,  everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and stis ,  and you can ejaculate all over a girl's family photos without her minding ?  really ,  this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn .  maybe for the next one ,  they'll finally break down and hire ron jeremy as the lead .  i'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character stifler's 3rd uncle once removed or something like that . 
being born in the 1960's i grew up watching the tv  " movies of the week "  in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including  " crowhaven farm "  ,   " bad ronald "  ,   " satan's school for girls "  ,   " kolchak the night stalker "  ,  etc ,  but this one is just plain dumb . this is obviously the writer's trying to capitalize on the horrific manson murders from a few years earlier .  the movie stars dennis weaver of  " mccloud "  and  " duel "  fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach .  the family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family .  the reason for this is never explained ,  and weaver's pacifistic stance is hard to swallow .  for god's sake ,  call the police ,  beat the hell of them or something ,  just don't sit there and whine about it .  the acting is pretty lame ,  the story unbelievable ,  etc .  susan dey looks cute in a bikini but that's about it .  ignore this if it ever airs on tv . 
there are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of ,  let's say ,  little monsters or scary looking dolls .  which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie ,  really .   dr .  feinstone  ( corbin bernsen )  has been a successful dentist for several years now ,  but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps ,  and he brings his anger and frustration to his work .  well ,  give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth ,  and you can probably guess what happens next .  .  .   as i said ,  brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should .  in particular the ending is a huge let down .  last note :  watch for mark ruffalo  ( you can count on me ,  eternal sunshine .  .  .  )  in this one .   5/10 . 
every movie from the thirties is dated ,  but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others .  i . e .  grand hotel is comparatively modern melodrama .  with ford ,  there's always the hard-sell of someone's nobility  ( abe ,  the joads )  .  always the over-emphasis of some heavy's badness .  always the poorly crafted ,  awkward and obvious scripts .  this is no exception .  it's just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment .  and sentiment is all this has going for it .   what ford does here doesn't make me appreciative of lincoln ,  it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here .  ford went on to make decent movies .  this is too dated to be anything but bad .  it feels entirely false .    henry fonda with a fake nose is bizarre .  and no one from illinois would pronounce the trailing 's , ' or say  " shonuff !  " 
the material in this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears .  yes ,  tears i tell you .  this popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights ,  put forth the greater good of the community and stop making up cowardly excuses for not challenging the establishment .  chavez represents the weak and misfortunate in the same way bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran amok .  indeed ,  latin america is being reshaped and the marginalized majority is finally having a voice in over five centuries .  though ,  in the case of mexico ,  the election was clearly stolen by calderon .  chavez is not perfect ,  far from it .  he's trying to change the constitution to allow him to rule indefinitely .  that cannot be tolerated .  enough with the politics and back to the movie ;  the pace is breath taking at moments ,  and deeply philosophical at others .  it portrays chavez as a popular hero unafraid to challenge the us hegemony and domination of the world's resources .  if you think the author is biased in favour of chavez ,  nothing's stopping you from doing your homework .  one crucial message of the film is questioning info sources ,  as was clearly demonstrated by the snippers casualties being shamefully blamed on chavez's supporters .  venezuela puts american alleged democracy to shame .  hasta la revolucion siempre ! 
this is the worst movie i've ever seen .  i'm not kidding .  the next time it comes on ,  i will just continually run my head into a wall .  it would me more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than attempting to make it through this movie again .   i hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again .  they are both good comedians ,  so i was shocked this was so awkward .   if they had to do it all over again ,  i'm pretty sure that they would decide to not do it .  the folks that fronted the money ,  must have lost a ton .  not really- because the special effects  ( all 2 of them )  were terrible . 
as you may or may not have heard ,  there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film .  one may then ask why the title suggested such a thing ,  but really it's kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either .  there was absolutely no story or plot ,  just things happening .  the acting was incredibly bad ,  worse than safeauto commercials bad .   not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it .  their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl .  the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer  ( i'm not kidding )  but they used chainsaw sound effects .   this was undoubtedly the poorest movie i've ever seen in my life .  the only circumstance that i wouldn't totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old's .   really though ,  even with all of the criticism i offer here ,  i'd suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever ,  and because of this is quite comical .  even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained . 
things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by spike lee .   bleek gilliam  ( denzell washington )  is a happenin' jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at below the underdog .  his problems include an incompetent manager ,  a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he's playing musical mattress with .  the real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music .  the band's manager ,  giant ,  has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but bleek remains loyal for as long as possible .  it will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man .   as bleek ,  denzell washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm .  he's too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art ,  dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness .  he simply lacks the fire .  wesley snipes who plays henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of lee's torpid dialogue .  as giant ,  lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction .  loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic ratso rizzo to bleek's joe buck he adopts a limp and even the  " i'm walkin' here "  moment from midnight cowboy .  in this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it .   lee's script is all tepid argument ,  heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that lee has to inject to remain down .  the scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the bleek ,  giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles .  completing this travesty is lee's pretentious visual style .  tracking shots ,  zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes .  they just wander .   blues is lee's love letter to jazz  ( made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets )  and it's all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve .  jazz on film is better served by tavernier's  " round midnight "  and eastwood's  " bird "  which get below the surface ,  reveal more sides of the form ,  the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by forrest whitaker and the real deal dexter gordon .  this spike lee joint doesn't even offer a mild buzz .  it's some pretty bad homegrown . 
in lizzie borden's  " love crimes "   ( 1992 )  ,  sean young plays a gritty d . a .  in atlanta .  she's a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man  ( patrick bergin )  who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women ,  takes compromising photos of them ,  then leaves them .   naturally ,  this tough loner decides to enter the phony shutterbug's life by posing as his prey ,  intending to bring him to justice .  they meet ,  they make love ,  then the next thing she knows ,  she is over his lap ,  getting spanked .   ( note :  the spanking scene is only in the  " unrated "  version of this film .  the r-rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more lucid .  )  this psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images ,  such as bergin chasing one of his victims around the room ,  flailing at her with a riding crop .   as a thriller ,   " love crimes "  is at its best when sean young is playing her cat-and-mouse game with bergin ,  trying to catch him in an incriminating act .  it's unfortunate that the film doesn't end ,  it just stops .  that's true .  director lizzie borden may have just run out of story to tell ,  but after 92 minutes the credits roll ,  and we are left with a puzzling  " what just happened ?  "  bewilderment .   the unfolding of young's plan is played out in engaging style ,  but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn-off for some viewers .   dan  ( daneldorado@yahoo . com ) 
this movie seems to start in the middle ,  introduces peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and paper-thin and/or impenetrable back-stories .  almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film .  the plot rambles and ultimately goes nowhere ,  the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors .  it almost feels like there's a first half of this movie but it never got made .   we're told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over new york city and that central park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland .  yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government .   we're presented with the  " evil corporation "  in eugenics but that's really just a convenient conceit to populate the universe with a couple power-tripping minions .  the whole  " eugenics-is-bad "  double-entendre is heavy-handed and never really pans out here .  we're supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why .  so much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes off as a 1-hour ,  40-minute fatalistic rationalization for rape .   on the  " ground-breaking "  digitally animated world created here ,  all i can say is that at about the same time as this film was made several other directors did the same thing with more seamless and believable results .   after spending the time to watch this film the most burning question left in my mind was ,   " so what ?  " 
what is really sad ,  shows like six degree's and brothers & sisters are the true reality tv ,  not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows .  i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellation's of numerous shows with a cult following .  but with the more vocal backlash the fans of jericho  ( which i also enjoy )  and other shows ,  networks may start to reverse this trend .  i am like others ,  i will not support any new shows until they have been given a second season .  i'll then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via dvd's and online viewing .  until then abc ,  you have lost me as a viewer to any new show . 
had this film been put together a tad better ,  it would be up there with the best of astaire and rogers .  as it is ,  it's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot ,  i . e .  ,  randolph scott romancing rogers' sister ,  played by harriet hilliard  ( that's ozzie nelson's wife to you baby boomers )  .   astaire and scott are two navy men .  scott meets hilliard the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian ,  and later on after ginger rogers has asked her friend  ( a blond but unmistakable lucille ball )  to glamor her up .  meanwhile ,  astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off .  the result is some wonderful dance numbers ,  with astaire and rogers as a team as well as separately :   " i'm putting all my eggs in one basket ,  "   " let yourself go ,  "  and  " i'd rather lead the band .  "  hilliard is sweet but a little lethargic as a plain jane turned glamor girl ,  although she sings her two songs well ,   " but where are you ?  "  and  " get thee behind me ,  satan "  - one poster didn't care for that song ,  but i love the title .  rogers is vivacious ,  and a youthful astaire is a dynamo .   the highlight of the movie comes at the end with  " let's face the music and dance ,  "  one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by rogers and astaire .  in it ,  they epitomize '30s glamor and fantasy .  it is truly to be treasured and watched again and again . 
so i'm at home ,  flipping channels one night ,  and i come across this man wearing heels and makeup ,  standing in front of a colored background on hbo .  naturally ,  i did a double-take and decided i'd watch for a little while .  i didn't change the channel until he was finished ,  it was so incredibly hilarious .  the next time it was on ,  i made sure to tape it so i could watch it over and over again ,  and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch .  during the first couple of minutes ,  you can tell that the audience isn't quite sure what to think ,  but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit .  while many stand-up comedians mesh together in my brain ,  eddie izzard stands out as one of the best .  his style is incredibly refreshing ,  and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events .  his show stayed with me afterwards .  i went to italy over the summer ,  and all i could think about while i was there was how  " italians are always on scooters going 'ciao .  .  . ' "  10 out of 10 .  see it .  you won't regret it . 
fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc .  carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time ,  and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting .  the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast  ( including morgan freeman as  " god "  )  is great and makes the film worth catching .  grade :  b
i wasn't aware of steve mcqueen in 1958 .  i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film .   ( i'd been devastated by the movie  " trantula "  at age seven  .   .   .  but i was ten now )  .  the 1st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer's probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater .  but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster's attacks .  i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor's office  ( poor doc )  ,  and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience  .   .   .  so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors ,  too huge now to fit through just one .  it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential ,  and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve-like diner ,  he seemed like a sure dinner to be .    to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description ,  but in the end ,  better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids .   i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick ,  trying to act brave .  he knew i was in trouble ,  and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room ,  but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor ,  there the red pulsating ,  heart-like hungry dude sat ,  waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom .  it took months to recover .    i'm 57 years old now  .   .   .  i've made it .   of course the blob wasn't destroyed . 
sophmoric this film is .  but ,  it is funny as all get out .  it shows the  " boys locker room mentality "  being played by the  " other side "  .  it is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are .  but that's probably not news to most women ,  'cause  ( just ask one )  ,   " they've heard 'em all before "  .   watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and 97 . 3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight .  and the other 2 . 7% .  .  . can you ever really please them ? 
for those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate ,  there is the duo of the  " second renaissance "  shorts .  i'm not exactly sure why they are split into two parts ,  especially since they're credited as one on the dvd  ( and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the dvd ?  )  ,  but they're informative even if they have a few gaps .   what really makes this first part stand out ,  from the second part and the rest of the animations as well ,  is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights .  graphic homages to slavery ,  fascism ,  concentration camps ,  and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the million man march and humanity's god-complex .  in fact ,   " god "  is never really referenced by these shorts ,  instead replaced by  " man's own image "  .   as far as the shorts go in the collection ,   " the second renaissance :  part i "  is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion .  it's a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become  " the architect of its own destruction .  "  some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature ,  but then again ,  that's basically what most of the matrix series has done ,  and it's been a driving force behind its success .   --polarisdib
i saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing  " last days "  and some charlie chaplin films .  based on the quality of the other features ,  i decided to give  " immortel "  a chance .  i nearly walked out of this movie ,  and i like science-fiction !  the story is set in a futuristic new york city ,  filled with blade runner-style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning/synthetic humans .  unfortunately ,  the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour-and-forty-five-minute movie .  three groups exist in this world :  humans ,  artificial humans ,  and egyptian gods .  the artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city .  the humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation .  the egyptian gods have a floating pyramid  ( modeled on the great pyramid of khufu ,  and complete with a deteriorated exterior ,  leaving a smooth  " cap "  on the pyramid .  wouldn't a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition ?  )  .  the pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it's there .  i won't bore you with the so-called plot ,  but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross-out scenes .  the film ,  as i said ,  looks to have been influenced by blade runner ,  and perhaps also by the fifth element and the matrix .  at the end of the film credits were listed thank-yous to the united kingdom ,  france ,  and italy .  the film is french ,  but uses british actors who don't speak french .  hence ,  it is obvious that their french dialog has been dubbed .  this is a distraction ,  and i also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting .  it doesn't help that the animations are poor--no better than a video game .  skip this one . 
so often a band will get together for a re-union concert only to find that they just can't get it together .  not so here .  this concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish .  these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego .  this is obvious from the start ,  before they even step on stage .  many faces in the crowd weren't even born when these guys first performed .  from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream ,  3 men ,  3 instruments ,  no fuss .  clapton ,  by his own admission ,  said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards ,  synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best .  ginger baker demonstrates why so many drummers today ,  speak of him as some sort of drumming guru .  jack bruce just great .  they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come .  this one's a 10 for me . 
this is one of my all-time favorite films ,  and while it may move too slowly for some ,  it's well worth seeing .  a corporate lawyer  ( richard chamberlain )  is dragged into a case involving  " city "  aborigines ,  and this is no ordinary case .  ok ,  a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing .  there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately ,  and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive .  the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans .  this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about  " city "  vs .   " tribal "  aborigines ,  and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways .  uh huh .  chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening ,  although no matter how many times i've seen this i can't quite grasp the exact connection .  this is a very eerie and creepy film ,  and is a fine example of peter weir's ability to create tension out of nothing .  the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally ,  it's the easiest way out and the scariest .  10 out of 10 and highly recommended . 
if alien ,  jurassic park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea ,  add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one down .  the film begins in jolly old england around 1100ad and then jumps to present day california .  our hero carver  ( dean cain )  is the new security chief and military advisor for a science lab 400 feet underground .  he arrives  ( carver is also a helicopter pilot )  with the lead scientist and we soon find out it's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone .  is it a dinosaur or what ?  as with the above movies ,  all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off .  the special effects on the monster are pretty good for a  " direct to video "  movie and dean cain does what he gets paid for .  but forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before .  again ,  don't go in with high expectations and you'll be ok . 
bad acting ,  bad lighting ,  bad plot !  !  this had the quality of a porno movie .  i have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this movie .  .  . it sucked big time !  !  don't waste your time or money on this crap !  it's amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video ,  it should be a crime !  ! 
i just saw this last night ,  it was broadcast on the canadian broadcasting corporation's 'passionate eye' series .  it has been screened recently  ( sept .  2003 )  at the toronto international film festival as well as many others .  it is a quite remarkable film .  the filmmakers literally stumbled into the story ,  being there to make a documentary about chavez himself .  instead ,  they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded .  they had unprecedented access to events and people and ,  for the most part ,  let the story unfold as it happens .  they ,  of course ,  have their own ideological perspective  ( which they make evident )  but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events ,  the people ,  and the background and history leading up to the coup .  as a film ,  it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense ,  and that is ,  i think ,  the way it should be .  what we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be .  what we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy .  .  .  a charismatic leader  ( chavez )  who actually cares for his people .  .  .  a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader .  .  .  and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds .   
i'm afraid that i have to disagree with the majority .  i found spike lee's latest a wee bit boring !  although he was trying something different ,  i . e .  not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer ,  i don't think it worked too well .   there's really a bit too much going on - vinny  ( john leguizamo )  and dionna's  ( mira sorvino )  relationship ,  ritchie's  ( adrien brody )  lifestyle and then the local mafia types .  the story is good ,  but at the end thats all you have - 2 or 3 stories .  with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film ?  >  there are some good points though .  all scenes with the 'son of sam' killer david berkowitz look very nice  ( colour saturation etc .  .  .  ) and the acting is pretty good throughout .   overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings .  it just wasn't strong enough in the end .   
 " hatred of a minute "  is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years .  not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means ,  but it's definitely worth a watch .     " hatred "  chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver  ( played by director kallio )  ,  a formerly abused child now grown up ,  and starting to listen to his evil side .     " hatred "  is very nice visually .  the shots are creative ,  and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at .  this film actually has an element of production value to it ,  unlike other recent michigan releases like  " dark tomorrow "  and  " biker zombies .  "  subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film's $350 , 000 budget .    however ,   " hatred "  stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do ,  and that's in the story and character department .  essentially ,  things just kind-of happen .  eric seaver doesn't evolve at all .  basically ,  he's always been crazy ,  it's just that people are starting to notice .  the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development .  also ,  the ending is very abrupt .    however- since this is a horror film ,  since when do we care about plot ?  we just want to see people die ,  and  " hatred "  certainly delivers .  as the body count mounted ,  people in the theater started cheering  " kill her !  kill em' all !  "  when people scream back at the screen ,  it's always fun .    that's the place where  " hatred "  succeeds .  it's fun .  and in the end ,  that's all that really matters . 
the version i saw of this film was the blockbuster rental with a similar title ,  but a swear word in it .   this film was funny as hell .  it was also true to the bone .  if you have ever spent time in hollywood or the area around it ,  you will understand the humor .  if not ,  you may not 'get it' at all .   the story of two people in the business struggling to make it until they finally reach a breaking point ,  it is a rare gem .  it states it is a drama ,  but it is a drama as much as deer hunter is a comedy .   loren dean is wonderful ,  as always ,  as a supporting actor .  jamie kennedy was able to hold his own well .  his performance is especically impressive during the poodle scene .  the only downside was carmen electra but we can't have everything . 
elvira mistress of the dark is just that ,  a campy concoction of fun ,  sex appeal ,  horror and comedy all poured into a low cut black gown and toped with a sky high black bouffant hair-do .  this movie is sure to delight any fan of elvira's .  it takes you upclose and personal with elvira and probes deep into her .  .  . um past revealing her enormous .  .  .  ancestry .   the movie takes you on a ride with elvira as she goes from tv horror hostess with the mostess to her home town of fallwell mass to claim her inheritance from a deceased great aunt .  where she encounters a stuffy town ,  a studly cinema owner ,  a creepy great uncle who seems to be after her for more than her good looks .  a slew of high school kids that immediately love her ,  and a town board who are will do anything to get her out of town ,  even if it means burning her at the stake !  watch elvira woo the kids ,  stalk the stud ,  avoid her creepy great uncle and thumb her nose at the stuffy uptight 'preservatives' who have no kind words for her ,  in elvira mistress of the dark !   as elvira would say  " i guarantee it'll be a scream !   ( screams in background )  whoa !  good thing i didn't say it'd be a gas !  " 
action ,  horror ,  sci-fi ,  exploitation director fred olen ray shows he has some talent as a director .  character actor william smith is one of the best tough/bad guys in the industry .  he treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career .  as for randy travis he gives his best lee van cleef impression .  he's not bad in the film .  smith and travis make the movie .  as for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out .  ray did a great job directing this flick ,  smith and travis were good ,  i'd give this b western on a scale of one to ten ( ten being the best )  a seven . 
does anyone think that this show actually helps some people ,  or does it only anger the people who watch it ?  when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity .  i understand that pat roberson is not all together .  what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say .  pat roberson is of little consequence .  he is an old man who thinks in an old way .  fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did  ( thank god )  .  now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity . 
this doesn't quite plumb the depths of creepshow 3 ,  but it comes close .  it also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology ,  which is distracting to say the least .   it also rather irritating rips off the twilight zone  ( with the bookshop being comparable to serling's later night gallery )  .  unfortunately ,  the producers & writers forgot that serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over .  none of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment .   framing story :  adam west is .  .  .  well ,  himself .  he doesn't go the bruce wayne/batman campy 60s route ,  but he rarely does .  he simply plays the not-particularly-enigmatic  " jay "   ( there's an ominous spine-chilling name to compare to the likes of dr .  terror ,  eramus ,  and the cryptkeeper )  ,  and makes some mildly awkward/creepy statements .   abernathy :  seen rod serling's  " a stop in willoughby "  ?  then you've seen this .  the red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose ,  but even the main character's friend identifies him as a wimp .  as well directed as can be expected ,  but basically incoherent .   nex's diner :  reminiscent of various serling time travel stories ,  mixed with steve allen's  " a meeting of minds .  "  most of the actors aren't too bad  ( except for josh astin as cassius ,  who manages to walk ,  talk and even breathe awkwardly )  ,  and the idea is mildly interesting .  but like abernathy ,  it doesn't go anywhere .  the main character raises some relatively reasonable questions ,  bugs out a bit  ( who wouldn't ?  )  ,  and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland .   life replay :  not a bad little piece ,  and manages to predate both click and creepshow 3 .  i suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls .  the main character is mildly sympathetic .  nothing substantially innovative here ,  but it's okay .   fighting spirit :  you see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character ,  it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption .   finale :  so .  .  .  why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits ?  don't know .  and doesn't make sense .  so .  .  .  all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped ?  kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer  ( thanks ,  guys !  )  ,  and the guy in the first segment died .  so how did he get trapped ?  did he visit the bookstore before he died ,  got trapped and .  .  .  didn't die ?  what ?  huh ?  i supposer this isn't expected to make sense because it's supernatural .  but still .  .  .   overall :  basically not dissimilar from the two newer twilight zone series ,  or some episodes of tales from the darkside or monsters .  the last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time .  but there's nothing really spectacular here . 
curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused ,  irritated and frightened .  the creaky old plot about about a phantom train that's said to run through the lonely english countryside at dead of night may be implausible ,  but it's a lot of fun .  there are some wonderful old cliches like  " the accident "  which the locals can remember but won't talk about .  but primarily the movie's a vehicle for comedian arthur askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits .  askey's corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun .  this is probably the best of askey's movies . 
a bdsm  " sub-culture "  of los angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess ,  plainly a vanity piece for its top-billed player ,  celia xavier ,  who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters vanessa and celia .  a question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera ,  lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer .  celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the county of los angeles ,  while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon cd-roms ,  but when disaster befalls  " mistress vanessa "  ,  virtuous celia ,  determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker ,  begins a new job as a  " sex slave "  at the private castle club where the specialty of the house is a  " dungeon party "  .  two fbi field agents  ( whose deployment to the vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet bdsm sites )  ,  in addition to a los angeles police department homicide detective ,  are assigned to investigate the crime ,  while endeavouring to provide security for celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her .  flaws in logic and continuity abound ,  such as a homicide being allocated to l . a . p . d . 's operations-south bureau ,  a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film .  direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction .  the mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario .  one solid acting turn appears among this slag :  stan abe as a zealous fbi agent . 
there are some nice shots in this film ,  it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light ,  in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset .   but it's basically more of a made for tv movie ,  and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot ,  which keeps it quite interesting viewing ,  there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish ,  so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost .   i had it as a xmas gift ,  as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented ,  and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in  " a time to kill "   ,  and the  " the newton boys  "  so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work .   however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy ,  he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film ,  he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on ,  so die hard fans ,  really not worth it from that point of view .   the films star though ,  patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye ,  and his character is just so nice and kind and caring ,  a true saint of a guy ,  he'd be well written into a rom com .   so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i've seen ,  i'd recommend ,   " a time to kill "   ,   " the newton boys  "   " frailty "  ,   " how to lose a guy in 10 days "  ,   " edtv "  and  " amistad "  and avoid too  " larger than life "  and  " angels in the outfield "  unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent ,  but are quite amusing films for children ,  again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines .   as for scorpion springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either . 
needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried - left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry .   i don't recall ever walking out on a movie before ,  but i really tried to stay .  the script was not up to the cast and just kept  " going and going "  badly - come on !  uma thurman doing this stuff ?  fairly lame special effects .  these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling .   this review is base only on the first hour - it might have gotten better .  i just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on . 
this movie was definitely not one of mary-kate and ashley's best movies .  i really didn't like it ,  and i was kind of disappointed in that movie .  for some reason ,  it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast .  in some parts ,  it got so boring that i had to fast forward it .  it didn't have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies . 
the year 1995 ,  when so many people talked about the great premiere of braveheart by mel gibson ,  also saw another very fine ,  yet underrated movie on scottish history ,  rob roy .  although it is a very different film ,  especially due to the historical period the story is set in ,  rob roy has much in common not only with marvelous braveheart but also with the very spirit of epic movies .   it is a film that discusses similar themes ,  like fight for dignity ,  courage ,  honor ,  revenge ,  family being a key to happiness .  it also leads us to the very bliss of scottish highlands where the human soul finds its rest being surrounded by all grandeur of nature .  robert roy macgregor  ( liam neeson )  ,  the main character is a true hero  ( so universal in epics )  ,  sort of  " scottish robin hood "  who struggles to lead his people out of oppression imposed by cold hearted lords .  although he worsens his situation through the acts ,  has to suffer a lot ,  two things stay in his mind undeniably :  honor that he is given by himself and love to his woman ,  mary macgregor  ( jessica lange )  .  that leads him to unexpected events .  .  .   except for the interesting content and quite vivid action ,  the movie is filled with truly stunning visuals .  this factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe .  many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves an insight into artistic images .  for me ,  the most splendid scene was in the highlands when rob roy tells his boys what honor really means .  then ,  he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman .  the scene he escapes marguis of montrose  ( john hurt )  to the waterfall is also worth a look as a stunning visual .    of course ,  there is some graphic violence ,  like in the duel for instance ,  but i don't think that this violence would be as harmful as in many other modern films .  its justification is like any other epic's :  bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it .  the most disturbing scene ,  for me ,  was the rape done on rob roy's wife by the villain of the story :  archibald cunningham  ( tim roth )  .  it's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away .  however ,  all the rest is o . k .  yet ,  there is one aspect that made me really love this movie ,  the performances .   all the cast do perfect jobs ,  from the leading lian neeson who fits very well to the role of tall ,  brave ,  strong scottish man to the supporting cast of brian cox who portrays wicked killearn ,  a silent witness of terrible acts who feels comfortable with the evil of war .  jessica lange is very fine as mary macgregor and has some of the most beautiful moments in the film .  there is chemistry between ms lange and mr neeson in many of their scenes .  john hurt ,  one of the best british actors ,  does a terrific job as marguis of montrose ,  a corrupted man for whom money is the aim in itself achieved by any means .  i like that calmness of his portrayal .  but the real villain is played by tim roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character ,  archibald - a man who mocks love ,  who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter .  but ,  like in any good epic ,  this exceptional evil must find its end .  .  .   and one more aspect :  the musical score :  such memorable and sentimental tunes that are bound to sound in the ears for long .  the final moment touched me to tears not only because of the beauty it conveys but because i deeply combined these blissful tunes with the grandeur of locations .  scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this movie reminded me of that permanent effect .  it was ,  as if ,  my second journey to scotland .   rob roy is a very nice movie ,  very well directed ,  photographed and acted .  it perhaps does not equal braveheart with its spectacular sets and crowds of extras in battle scenes ,  but it is a fairly long film with much attention placed on one very significant feature a cinema should have :  stunning entertainment combined with heartfelt education .  i really enjoyed that film ,  do not hesitate to call it metaphorically  " highlands of entertainment "  and rate it 9/10
i'll admit to being biased when i reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series .  i saw this film for the first time in ~2005 on the late night  " fear friday "  on amc ,  which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold storage for new generations .  i made it a point to watch the entire amicus anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure i had perspective .  looking back ,  i still rate the house that dripped blood as my favorite ,  followed closely by tales from the crypt and then asylum .   i think all of the elements that make this series charming---the vintage '60s/'70s style cinematography ,  creepy to kooky ,  far-fetched tales and the utter britishness of it all right down the backing music----came together better here than any of the others overall .  the movie centers around a very old english country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within .   the first story involves a horror writer and his wife ,  who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion .  he creates a murderous character called dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction .  there is a subtle physchedelia here via his torment that i found amusing yet creepy .  oh and those horrible prop teeth  ( then again these are british actors ,  maybe those were real !  !  !  )    the second story is the tale of a lonely old man  ( peter cushing )  that has moved here to escape his loneliness ,  yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love .  he seems to have found possible salvation at a local  ( very creepy )  wax museum ,  but it turns out he would have been much better off alone .  .  .  .  .  .  .   the third story includes the great christopher lee  ( my fav british horror actor )  as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter .  he is constantly wary of her getting into things she shouldn't---like witchcraft !  she has a natural talent for it ,  with good reason .  lee is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian ,  that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth !  !  but despite his best efforts ,  the little troublemaker does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow .  .  .  .  .  .   this final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't qualified to capture a proper vampire film ,  right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular .  so he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a foggy night to get something more  " authentic "  .  little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire's cloak !  putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects .  by the time i had gotten to this fourth and final story ,  it was after 3 am and i couldn't quite stay awake on the first try  ( not from boredom )  .  but i did experience something that i have hundreds of times ,  a curious bonding experience i have with films or music when i drift in and out of sleep and the film/music becomes part of my dream !  !  great fun !  !  this bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because i woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak's power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first .  not long after ,  the lovely ingrid pitt ,  a costar on his movie set ,  came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight---but he needn't have bothered ,  for she was a real vampire herself .  the chintzy keyboard jingle that followed as she flew toward him on the staircase was simply hysterical !  !  and again in my half-asleep state ,  seemed rather confusing !  side note :  make sure to catch lee and pitt along with the stunning amicus star britt ekland in the all time classic film the wicker man  ( 1973 )  .    the weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories ,  but based on the stories themselves ,  this is a classic !  objectively ,  i would say the third story is best ,  but i like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much . very highly recommended for horror fans and if you're a british horror fan ,  it's mandatory !  i'd say it's worthwhile to view the series in chronological order if you can .  the last film of this series ,  monster club  ( 1980 )  is certainly the weakest .  i think the first 3-4 films except for the at times mediocre torture garden  ( 1967 )  are the best ,  but if you like any of them ,  you should watch them all at least once .  you'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites . 
since the start of her career in the 70's and vastly throughout the exuberant 80's ,  elvira  ( cassandra peterson )  has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror & bad monster movies .  while ms .  peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures ,  covering a wide variety in genres ,  it was her tv-character elvira that brought her the most fame .  part of her charm  and respect from the fans  lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous  ( unlike many other big name actors & actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their  " early "  work )  .  i've seen only bits & pieces of her tv performances ,  but her cameo role in ghoultown's recent tribute song  " mistress of the dark "  really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff .  one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video :  over the years ,  elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid-80's came around .   and in 1988 ,  after films like  " fright night "  and  " terrorvision "  incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tv-work ,  it finally happened :   " elvira ,  mistress of the dark "  ,  the motion picture .  now ,  i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days ,  but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film .  a few years ago ,  i did manage to watch  " elvira's haunted hills "   ( made in 2001 )  ,  but for some reason it didn't impress me all that much .  was it really that forgettable ,  or should i give it another watch ?  i actually really do feel like re-watching it now ,  as this first elvira film from '88 really convinced me .  though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work ,  might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script ,  there really is no way to deny it :  cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy  ( she also co-wrote the screenplay )  .   when elvira learns she's one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt  ( she never heard of before )  ,  she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas .  out to claim her rightfully inherited money ,  she travels to a quiet new england town .  but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat .  in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her  ( often unintentionally )  provocative behaviour .  to make things worse ,  her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected :  a rundown mansion ,  a cookbook and a poodle .  but what she doesn't know ,  and her evil uncle vincent albot does ,  is that her great aunt was a witch ,  and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable .  and if you haven't turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe-book ,  then rest assured ,  you're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face .   it's surprising how a script rigged together with boob-jokes ,  witty one-liners ,  movie references ,  inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story .  simple ,  of course ,  but coherent .  while other movies ,  heavily relying on gag-like situations ,  often make you loose track of the story completely  ( like the  " naked gun "  films ,  for example )  ,  this film doesn't .  a lot of horror-comedies were being produced during the 80's ,  but not a lot of them actually worked .  let alone a horror-spoof that doesn't derail at some point  (  " killer party "  ,  although i'm grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale )  or becomes too tedious too quickly  (  " saturday the 14th "  )  .  although  " elvira "  is more comedy than horror ,  it doesn't loose track of what it's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale ,  complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot ,  including a real honest-to-god witch hunt and elvira's very own burn-at-the-stake moment .   i'm telling you ,  there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny .  one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already ,  when daniel greene's name appeared .  daniel who ?  oh yes ,  i recognized his name  ( and later on his dim-witted macho-face )  .  how can one not forget daniel greene once you've seen .  .  .   " atomic cyborg aka fists of steel "  !  but if you haven't seen  " atomic cyborg "  ,  then i'm sorry ,  but you won't be able to laugh with his face in this one .  and on a side-note :  i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station .  even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better . 
i saw this movie originally in the theater ,  when i was 10 .  even at that age the 'humor' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence .   in the past ,  whenever i would see ed begley jr .  or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad .  until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today ,  i was unsure why i felt that way .  apparently i blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained .  apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen ,  nay eaten by the creators of this inhuman work .   i haven't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult .  i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can *truly* put it behind me .  some regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either . 
this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares .  for a horror or  " thriller "  film and hype ,  it's way too tame .  there are only a few tense moments in here ,  not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre .  even those  " tense "  scenes weren't much .  the music made them more dramatic that they actually were .   there is a lot of symbolism in here ,  so the elitist critics label this  " a thinking person's horror film .  "  well ,  if they think about it ,  i'm sure they will come to the same conclusion i did - a waste of money at the video rental store .   summary :  a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting .  vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised . 
it's a bad movie ,  it seems like there is only 5 police in hk ,  they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a jacky chan's movie .  all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only .  when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other ,  what a funny movie .  in the movie ,  it's like all the good guys died without a reason .   they story line of the movie also sucks ,  the story jump here and there and bored people .  but if you wanted to see a bloody movie ,  i think this is only a ok type of movie ,  i think u . s .  made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one
offbeat ,  slow-paced ,  entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and  " blasphemous "  scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers .  however ,  it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains ,  or to ignore krabbe's first-rate performance .  verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film ,  playing with the meaning of the hero's visions-omens .  unfortunately ,  in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur ,  and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie .   ( *** ) 
although critically maligned ,  johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen .  it's a movie that should be watched closely ;  some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them .  for instance ,  keep an eye on michael keaton's use of the pricing gun at the pet store .  .  . and also on the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of scenes .  it's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly ,  even though you know it's a comedy .  amy heckerling ,  the director ,  is really sharp here--if you enjoyed her better known films  ( fast times at ridgemont high ,  clueless ,  european vacation ,  etc .  ,  ) you should give this one a look .   michael keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast  ( griffin dunne ,  maureen stapleton ,  joe piscopo ,  peter boyle )  is excellent .  highly recommended . 
as alan rudolph's  " breakfast of champions "  slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordon's  " mother night "  came out .  now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being  " unfilmable "  it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments  ( the other being  " slaughter-house five "  )  .   " mother night "  is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why .  it's brilliant !  it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut's book  ( without being stilted or overly literary )  and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic .  how many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that ?  vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film ,  and can you ask for a better endorsement than that ?  not only is it a beautiful film ,  it is a beautifully acted ,  written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s .  it's a mournful ,  inspired ,  surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected .  i would sincerely encourage anyone to see  " mother night "  - it doesn't even take a familiarity with vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it  ( as  " slaughter-house five "  sometimes does )  .  it is a powerful ,  affecting piece of cinema . 
i grew up watching inspector gadget .  it was ,  and still is ,  one of my favorite cartoons ,  if not my absolute favorite .  i learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off inspector gadget's field trip .  i wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever .   but the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon .   matthew broderick ,  an actor with potential ,  was definitely not the role for inspector gadget .  first thing- in the film ,  inspector gadget is smart .  not so in the cartoon .  in the film ,  gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself .  in the cartoon ,  it was almost always penny ,  brain ,  and the awesome book  ( i still want her book !  )  .  if gadget solved the mystery ,  it was by accident .  gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective ,  but in the cartoon was pretty dumb ,  which was where the humor came from .   another thing is that it's too much  " good guy v .  bad guy "  in the film .  it's not just meant to be a silly saturday morning cartoon .  also ,  gadget never should have a love story ,  but disney corporation is filled with idiots .   also i miss the true gadgets that gadget had ,  and especially the gadget car .  in the movie it was a chic convertible .  in the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van .  it also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place .   but if anything ,  the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie .  inspector gadget was a silly saturday morning cartoon .  the movie was too serious ,  too overdone ,  had too much of a plot and wasn't even remotely as funny .   tip for those who haven't seen it :  never see it .  ever .  watch the cartoon ,  it's a true classic . 
first of all ,  f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft .   secondly ,  the f14's and f18's cannot change their appearances ;  they are not transformers .    thirdly ,  the f16 has only one m61 cannon ,  not two .    last but not the least ,  at the end of the film ,  seagle selected sidewinder missile .  but somehow when he pulled the trigger ,  the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick .  as i have the experience of seeing f18's and f14's being mysteriously transformed into f16's ,  this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me .  however ,  there is still one question i have to ask :  how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16 .  .  .   when students hand in really bad work ,  teachers assign 0's .  now i think for the sake of properly marking this film ,  imdb should seriously consider adding a '0/10' option .  otherwise ,  it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10 .  .  . 
this is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology ,  that if a bit short in the screenwriting department ,  more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting ,  location work and overall exuberance .  the best episodes of this are the first with denholm elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works  (  a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian )  ;  the third ,  with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project .  the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is sparkling and inspired ,  both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up !  cushing is typically good in the weakest segment ,  which certainly isn't helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he's obsessed with down at the local wax museum ,  is anything but  " beautiful "  as we are told to believe she is !  someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we're given a woman with a jaw of a turtle .  minor quibbles aside this movie and it's wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can . 
i grew up watching ,  and loving this cartoon every year .  i didn't think they would be able to take a half hour  ( 20 min !  )  cartoon and make it a movie .  they did it .  with flying colours !  fabulous ,  funny ,  heart warming ,  effective movie ! 
i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about 10 .  it was on right after bay city rollers .  i saw it come on to family channel one day ,  and taped it for my then three-year old daughter .  i'd forgotten all the things i'd loved as a child ,  the magic flute ,  the zoom broom ,  witcheepoo's makeup .   this show is decidedly low tech .  the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese ,  and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes .  but kids love this stuff .  they would way ,  way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation .  there is  ( mild )  slapstick ,  but no adult themes such as sex or people dying ,  and kids accept jimmy's schemes .  kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire ,  and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead .  the music is old ,  but you really get used to it ,  and my daughter really loved it .  she used to sing  " different is hard ,  different is lonely "  in the car .  my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months ,  and it's still one of her favourites .   i see that a new pufnstuf 2000 is in the works .  i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don't do anything like computer-animating characters etc .  i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf . 
based on robert louis stevenson's st .  ives ,  the film tells the story of a dashing young french hussar captain  ( jean marc barr )  during the napoleonic wars .  captured in battle he is sent to a prisoner of war camp in the scottish highlands ,  run by major farquhar  ( richard e grant )  in short order he falls in love with a local girl  ( anna friel )  ,  strikes up a friendship with the major ,  and discovers that his long lost grandfather ,  who fled from france during the revolution ,  lives just up the road !  spirited performances from all the cast and some memorable lines make this an above average offering . 
years ago ,  i found a  " bargain bin "  copy of this film for a buck or two .  in so many ways ,  this is quite fitting ,  as when it was made back in 1933 ,  it was truly a cheaply made film by the  " poverty row "  studio ,  majestic .  however ,  while the film is rather derivative ,  it is still well worth watching and provides a few surprises .   the story is very ,  very familiar ,  as in some germanic town ,  the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires !  adding to this familiarity is dwight frye .  he played renfield in dracula ,  and here he is very ,  very similar--though he plays a much more harmless weirdo .  in this case ,  he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths .  the film does a good job of providing some  " red herrings "   ( i . e .  ,  false leads )  and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out frye may not be responsible ,  the who and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror film .  in addition ,  while the production had little money to speak of ,  it still had some good actors of the day--lionel atwill and melvin douglas--and it also used universal studios sets at night  ( when they were done filming for the day )  .  as a result ,  the film looks pretty good overall ,  though i also thought that ,  as usual ,  fay wray was terrible--thought it didn't noticeably detract from the film .  i have seen her in more movies than most people on imdb and i have come to notice that her characters have no depth--she always seems to be cast as the  " screaming lady "  and provides little new in each film .   overall ,  for fans of old horror films ,  this is excellent and worth seeing .  for people who are not fans of the genre ,  it's probably pretty skip-able . 
herbie ,  the volkswagen that thinks like a man ,  is back ,  now being driven by maggie peyton  ( lindsay lohan )  ,  a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion .  the only thing standing in her way is the current champion ,  trip murphy  ( matt dillon )  ,  who will do anything to stop them .   the original love bug wasn't that good .  even as a kid ,  i remember not liking it very much .  i had some hope for the sequel though .  i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie .  unfortunately ,  herbie is no better now than he was before .  the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12 .  it will probably entertain the kids but that's all .   i realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting .  there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end .  most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too .  lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton .  she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls .  matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone .  he was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with .  justin long ,  breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special .   angela robinson directs and she does an okay job .  she tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script .  thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier ?  these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable .  it's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder .  in the end ,  herbie is a safe ,  predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid .  everyone else is better off skipping it .  rating 4/10
i saw this movie by luck ,  just because i was going through a phase where i had a new found admiration for bill pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank god i did !  this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites !  the story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom .   alice and darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story .  the struggle they go through as they are arrested in thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense .  the acting is amazing ,  the images extraordinary ,  the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful .  i actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time i watch it .  i know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but i swear ,  this one ,  you have to see !  !  !  i promise it will stick with you ! 
after reading the other tepid reviews and comments ,  i felt i had to come to bat for this movie .   roeg's films tend to have little to do with one another ,  and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark .   what this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith .  the only other film like it-in terms of its religious message-would have to be tolkin's `the rapture . '  i am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural .  it is a simple movie about catholic faith ,  miracles ,  and redemption--though you would never guess it till the end .  it is also the only movie i can think of whose resolution turns ,  literally ,  on a pun .   as a  ( happily )  fallen catholic myself ,  i know what the movie is about ,  and i find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between god and man .  but if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based ,  then it will go right over you head .   as a film-as opposed to a story-`cold heaven' it is not ground-breaking .  while `the rapture' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery ,  `cold heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities .  there are no striking shots ,  no edgy effects ,  no attempts to fit the content to the form .  it is workmanlike shooting ,  but subdued .  nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama .  it is a simple story that unfolds simply .  it may seem odd ;  but at the end the mystery is revealed .  it looks ambiguous ;  but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of catholic dogma .   in this regard ,  `cold heaven' has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like `the sting , ' or `the sixth sense , ' or `final descent , ' or polanski's `a pure formality . ' all of these are films with a trick up their sleeves .  they may frustrate you along the way ,  but they have a point-an obvious one ,  indeed--but the fun is ,  at least in part ,  in having been taken in .   still ,  even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line ,  it is worth watching for way it directs-and misdirects-you .  try it-especially if you are ,  or have ever been ,  a catholic . 
i first saw this film as a teenager .  it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world .  trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks .  with a cast that features skippy from family ties ,  gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher ,  how can you go wrong ?  backwards evil messages played on vinyl !  yes thats right ,  they use records in this movie .  in one scene eddie  ( skippy )  is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary .  monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed .  as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine .  almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies . 
do not be mistaken ,  this is neither a horror ,  nor really a film .  i firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure ;  the only reason it merited a star was the presence of chris pine .   nothing happens .  you wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist ,  a hint of surprise ,  a plot to emerge - but no .   the characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet don't have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful  ( bring on the teen rock montage )  state .  the only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic 'companion' .   their encounters with obstacles  ( be they human or physical )  are brief ,  confusing and entirely pointless .   chris pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast .  lou taylor pucci couldn't be dryer if he spent the summer with keanu reaves combing the navada desert .   watch 'the road' ,  watch '28 days later' ,  watch day time tv .  .  . anything but this ;  i implore you .  suffer the boredom ,  unlike you may be led to believe in the film ,  this film is no cure . 
visually speaking ,  this film is stunning .  it has some delightful black comedic moments .  but on the whole ,  the plot is very clichéd ,  as is its seeming message .  if you're a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw ,  you'll love it .  if you're looking for something at all high-brow ,  steer away .  i saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06 ,  and i only chose it because i was looking for something disturbing .  ultimately ,  it isn't disturbing .  just grinding and unpleasant to sit through .  if you genuinely want to be challenged ,  go see something like the lost .  if you want to be grossed out ,  or tell your friends about a really messed up film ,  then this is for you . 
this film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men  ( one of them burt reynolds )  ,  a prostitute ,  and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in miami .  the convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time .  the movie was mildly entertaining ,  but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening .  in a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to  " stretch "  the developing process to save the images .  somebody didn't know how to operate a movie camera .  amazing that this film was even released ! 
this movie was absolute torture .  first of all ,  it's a whopping 4+ hours long !  true ,  the kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for ,  but every single one of those battles need not have been shown .  so maybe this is a documentary ,  not a commercial film as advertised .  sure didn't seem like it ,  as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws .  the battle sequences were so poorly executed .  i am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in border .  each battle was the exact same as the previous .  it was so predictable .   ( this might be a spoiler .  )  the whole army marches uphill ,  five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each  ( they also use the same cussword every time )  ,  one of the lead actors is shot ,  someone yells for a stretcher ,  the actor says ,   " no ,  don't get a stretcher .  that will take 6 men from the battalion ,  "  and then an actor dies .  that exact same thing happens over and over and over again .  oh ,  and the songs are so bad and so long .  the cast of the movie is too big for its own good .  despite such a long movie ,  none of the characters were well developed .  the actresses had the most miniscule roles .  they all are dressed and portrayed to be the same .  two of them were weeping synchronized .  it was so comical .  they moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together .   the list just goes on and on .  i know i'm still forgetting something  .  anyways ,  i think i have bashed the film enough that you get the picture . 
von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world .  so as viewers we think we watch a  " true "  story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated ,  often to the point that the movie works disturbing  ( dancer in the dark )  or painful  ( the idiots/ idioterne )  .  of course the dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory  ( besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier )  .   the story is typical for von trier :  our hero is idealistic ,  seems to balance his relations with everybody else ,  but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves .  the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist .  mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to  ( self- ) destruction .   ( these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark .  )  the movie is also full of cynical  ( even humorous )  undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post-war germany .   as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed :  shifting and fading washed-out colors ,  screen overlays ,  action on different overlays  ( with the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting )  .  in this movie we can see how good von trier's handles film as a technical medium .  in his later works he seems to step down from this  ( as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available )  . 
i almost burst into tears watching this movie .  not from laughing but from the memories of a great rodney dangerfield movie .  candyshack was his first and stole the movie ,  easy money had him at his best ,  and back to school is by far an 80's classic masterpiece .  then there was ladybugs and that's when it started to show .  poor rodney was getting old  ( meet wally sparks was a slight step up from ladybugs but not saying much )  .    in my 5 wives rodney plays monte  ( a name he must love since that was his name in easy money )  a rich  ( isnt he always )  guy who loves women and gets married like its nothing .  well now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the amish ,  he inherits 5 wives .  this sounds like a great idea for a dangerfield movie .  the problem is everything .  the script is so poor that rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do .  the movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequences that are obviously not rodney .  andrew dice clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say the f word  ( which he should since the film is rated r but plays as if it was pg )  and jerry stiller has a nice 2 minute cameo .  don't get me wrong ,  at times i did laugh at a few of rodney's jokes but the poor man is getting way too old and way too slow .  we can see his jokes coming from miles .  and the film turns way too pc which thanks to the horrible 1990's ,  the 70's and 80's rodney just doesn't work anymore . 
i saw a trailer for this on afro promo ,  the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african-americans .  it looked like what it is ;  a highly tendentious  " wacky "  comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay .  it would seem that redd foxx's  ( rf )  wife has left him for his brother ,  who works with him at  " the store "  back in phoenix .  he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles .   so as rf arrives ,  norman ,  wearing nothing but powder-blue bikini shorts ,  gets out of his waterbed to answer the door .  trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor ,  norman tries to wake his lover ,  who steadfastly refuses to budge .  it was just to the point where i wrote  " why won't he wake up ?  "  when suddenly he does ,  and me and my friend's jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue-eyed ,  swirl-hairdoed garson ,  norman's white live-in lover ,  who just  " had the most faaaaaabulous dream "  garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from 1976 l . a .  he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry ,  and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch .   norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit .  garson goes to stay with waylon flowers ,  and madam answers the phone when norman calls .    so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico .  while he is on the phone ,  garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him .  with a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation  ( but sounding more like we're about to hear a very special track by the emotions )  ,  he realizes that his son is gay .   his first impulse is  " i'll kill him .  i'll kill him .  "  then rf goes on a long walk ,  wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have ,  such as  " maybe we toilet trained him too soon .  "  his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk ,  for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man .  surprisingly ,  he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality .  this ,  it must be said ,  is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought .  he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all !    rf then hires audrey ,  a six-foot amazon prostitute  ( in this amazing fur thing )  played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones .  he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality ,  but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody .   then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night .  he commiserates over the loss of rf's wife ,  and tells the tale of his own mother ,  who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because  " she was molested at a luau .  "  they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam ,  which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose .  once more ,  mouths were agape .   so it seems that ,  wouldn't ya just know it ,  rf and garson have a wonderful evening together !  you see ,  staid ,  traditional older black men just have to see the crappy ,  highly-effeminate entertainment of mega-queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer !  it's really just that simple !  this still does not prevent rf from yelling  " rape !  "  when garson wakes him from a bad dream .  it ends less predictably than you'd think .   there was so much that was just off .  what is the basis of norman and garson 's relationship ?  they don't seem to have any rapport ,  and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out ,  and even when he comes around to stand up for himself ,  he never defends garson or talks about their relationship .  there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality-and sitting right down on the park bench to read them !  i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality ,  rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends .   other than that ,  it's kind of just what it seems like :  a little relic of a bygone era ,  an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance ,  we could all learn to love and understand one another !  and because of the whole naiveté of this thing ,  the extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated ,  and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years .  i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays' female friends are desperately in love with them ,  and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with ,  and by extension convert ,  them .   ------ hey ,  check out cinema de merde ,  my website on bad and cheesy movies  ( with a few good movies thrown in )  .  you can find the url in my email address above . 
i had never heard of this one before the owner of my local dvd rental outlet mentioned it to me ;  being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the u . k .  ,  i decided to check it out .  the film turned out be a dull ,  amateurish and ugly-looking ride ;  the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time ,  whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept !    what’s worse ,  the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings .  soon ,  one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again ;  another ,  still bed-ridden ,  is quickly disposed of  ( after being forgotten for most of the duration )  .  the heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house :  a harridan of a bible-thumping mother  ( cue horrendous overacting )  ,  her repressed  ( and long-suffering )  daughter ,  and the latter’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests .   often resorting to dinner-table reminiscences by the man-hating mother  ( as a means of filling in the dreary ,  to say nothing of unoriginal ,  backstory )  and which invariably develop into mother-daughter sparring contests ,  the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious ,  but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film  ( as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore )  or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time .  .  . 
having worked in downtown manhattan ,  and often ate my lunch during the summer days in the park near city hall ,  i would see the mayor come and go .  it was great being able to go beyond the doors of city hall and see what it looked like in the lobby and through out the entire building .  al pacino ,  ( mayor john pappas )  ,  " gigli "  , '03 ,  gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture ,  and especially when he gave a speech at an african american church for a little boy who was slain .  john cusack ,  ( deputy mayor kevin calhoun )  ,  " runaway jury "  , '03 ,  was a devoted servant to the mayor and worshiped him in everything he attempted to accomplish .  bridget fonda ,  ( marybeth cogan )  ,  starts to fall in love with kevin calhoun and gives a great supporting role .  last ,  but not least ,  danny aiello ( frank anselmo )  ,  " off key "  , '01 ,  played a mob boss who had some very difficult choices to make towards the end of the picture !  great film with great acting and fantastic photography in nyc ! 
samuel fuller is hardly one of america's great directors .  i'm not sure he qualifies as one of hollywood's great craftsmen .  but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music .  during the time he worked for hollywood studios ,  he knew how to take an assignment ,  shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts .  .  . on time and on budget .  pickup on south street is a case in point .  on the surface it's one more of hollywood's early fifties' anti-commie movies ,  complete with appeals to patriotism ,  a hard-boiled hero and a slimy  ( and copiously perspiring )  bad guy .  fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichés into a taut ,  exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists .  the hero ,  skip mccoy ,  is a three-time loser ,  a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end .  the girl in the caper ,  candy ,  has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined .  one of the most appealing characters ,  moe williams ,  is a stoolie .  and in an unusual approach to hollywood's battle against commies ,  the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears ;  the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling .  he just wants payback for a personal reason ,  and winds up becoming .  .  . at least for now .  .  . a good guy .    plus ,  all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio .  he had to make do .  richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star ,  but jean peters is a surprise .  she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb ,  and no better than her boy friends .  .  . or her clients .  .  . want her to be .  and richard kiley ,  who later would become a two- time tony award winning star on broadway ,  is convincingly slippery and cowardly .  it's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us ,  i mean introduced to us ,   " the impossible dream "  from man of la mancha ,    more than anything else ,  this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash ,  pursued by the feds and the commies ,  moves straight ahead with great economy .  the whole enterprise ,  with a classic noir look ,  only takes 80 minutes to tell .  the dialogue ,  with fuller as screenwriter ,  has that party corny ,  partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style .   " that muffin you grifted .  .  . she's okay ,  "  one character says to skip about candy .  fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next .  then fuller throws in the character of moe williams .  all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest ,  part comedy relief and part sad inevitability .    the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fuller's talents and strengths .  in 2 minutes and 15 seconds ,  starting right after the credits ,  fuller is able to instantly power up the movie ,  to establish for us what the story is about ,  and to show us what kind of characters -- skip and candy -- we're going to be involved with .  and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot ,  packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us .    says glenn erickson ,  in my opinion one of the best of movie critics ,   " in what should be an inconsequential story ,  sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up :  stiff-necked ,  aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it .  as always in his work ,  the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort .  "  he's right ,  and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years . 
this picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of sheriff buford pusser .  bo svenson takes over the role of sheriff buford pusser ,  and luke askew plays the role of mobster pinky dobson .  the last that we saw sheriff pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed sunday morning drive .  after pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife .  is pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes .  the only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story .  how could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it .  since there was real no name actress in this picture i can't give it 10 weasel stars but i can give 8
i personally watched this to see the footage of the 60's and 70's .  it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life .  the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous .  you feel like you're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same time .  .  . because it feels so good and familiar .  i loved it ,  all segments from 60's-present day .  i highly recommend this for all aspects ,  including rock music ,  the hipper movement ,  politics and good 'ol history .  i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler ,  only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards ,  since i discussed what's in all 4 segments ,  so just wanted to be safe . 
this film has renewed my interest in french cinema .  the story is enchanting ,  the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful .  i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie . 
if you've seen other movies like this ,  they're probably better .  the omega man comes to mind .  to the studio's credit ,  they avoided the sprawling ,  unnecessary ,  big budget technofest that typifies movies of this ilk .  additionally ,  the set-up and premise were excellent :  four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease .  what's bad is everything else !  i get tired of endlessly stupid ,  careless ,  wimpy ,  ineffective ,  arrogant characters in a movie .  that pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point .  i rented it ,  and found myself yelling at the tv repeatedly ,   " no ,  don't do that !  "  ,   " why are you so stupid "  ,   " look out !  "  ,  etcetera .  a true lack of character development is evident about halfway in .  a movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them .  this one does not .  also , there should have been a longer ,  more involving end to the movie as well . 
verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage .  he's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed .  by his own admission ,  he read 2 chapters of the book ,  got bored ,  and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch .   heinlein would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it .  it basically steals the name ,  mocks politics of the book  ( which is a good portion of it )  ,  and throws in some t&a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn't get bored .   this anime isn't perfect ,  but it's at least mostly accurate ,  as best i can tell . 
i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie .  this movie was not intended to be a  " deep thought "  movie ,  which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be .  in fact ,  it would appear that if any movie doesn't produce a life altering insight ,  and a deep ,  twisted ,  mind boggling plot ,  they would rate it a 1 or 2 .  don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre ,  people .   this movie was an action/comedy flick ,  and that's all it was intended to be .  and for an action/comedy ,  it was very well done .  i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did ,  having never really been a jamie foxx fan ,  and having the over-used plot that it has .   the plot was nothing spectacular ,  using the typical criminal gets out of prison ,  and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act  ( see blue streak ,  hudson hawk ,  48 hours ,  etc .  etc .  etc .  )  but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist .  now the  " bad guys "  are actually the  " good guys "  and the real  " bad guy "  is an uber-geek .   jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous ,  while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character ,  and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film .   if you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in  " the matrix "  or a drama such as  " of mice and men "  then this movie isn't for you .  but if you enjoy the raw action ,  excellent fast-paced filming ,  and an occasional twist of humor tossed in ,  this movie won't disappoint you .  i would normally have rated it about an 8  ( on the same level as the die hard trilogy )  ,  but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be .   
i saw this film in my cinema class .  i am glad that i did not pay to see it .  i came into it with an open mind ,  and was even a little excited .  i really enjoy ed norton and evan rachel wood ,  and the rest of the cast was interesting .  i just never connected with this movie .  the acting was great ,  the cinematography was interesting ,  but the storyline ,  or rather ,  lack thereof ,  was a problem .  there was no central ,  connecting theme to the movie .  was it a romance between norton and wood ?  well ,  no ,  not really .  was it a western ?  kind of ,  but no .  i'm all for twists in movies ,  i recently saw  " brick "  and loved it ,  but the place that this movie went was just too out there .  it was so weird ,  and if i weren't required to have sat through the whole film ,  i would have walked out .  the writing wasn't terrible ,  but it was just all over the place .  by the time this movie ended ,  i was just left terribly confused and wishing that it had ended sooner .  there was just something about this film that didn't resonate ,  i understand more offbeat films like  " fight club "  ,  but i just did not care about the characters at all . 
i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself ,  but i just got back from this movie ,  and felt i had to express my opinions .  let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan .  but what makes a horror movie ?  i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development .  i know they often lack in horror movies ,  but prom night looked like it didn't even put forth any effort in that department .  next ,  we all love suspense .  that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises .  yeah ,  prom night had none of that !  of course ,  we like a terrifying killer .  prom night have that ?  nope ,  it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife .  and when all else fails .  .  . at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore ,  and the occasional nude scene !  yeah ,  well when you have a horror movie rated pg-13 like prom night ,  they leave that stuff out too .  so with all of these elements missing ,  i ask .  .  .  . does this still count as a horror movie ?  nope .  i'd call it more of a comedy .  people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw  " semi-pro "  that was supposed to actually be a comedy  ( which also sucked ,  but thats another story !  )  .  i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror .  all the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money .  the people i went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake !  which made me mad !  i wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake ?  ?  ?  where will horror go next ?  ?  ? 
this movie might not put the catholic church in the best light but it is telling a story based on true events .  unfortunately not everything in life ,  including religion ,  are all nice and rosy .  sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem like the right thing but in retrospective do not look as great as they once did .   " a love divided "  tells the story of a family ,  yes it does incorporate religion ,  but really the story is about a family ,  and that family's ability to stay together no matter what is thrown at them .  this film is also based on true events which is not to say that this story ,  scene by scene ,  is true ,  but if you were to look at news articles from that time period you would be able to see that neither churches handled the incident in a way that was helpful towards the family .  both churches are at fault here ,  the catholic church for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it and the protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fight .  in this case both let this family down .  i believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle in both the church and the family .  it in no way shape or form is putting down the catholic church ,  just the opposite ,  it shows how one incident can change the course of that religion's ideas and how one person can have an effect far more reaching then just themselves . 
 " piece is cake "  is defeatist ,  revisionist history of the worst kind ,  whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the  ( admittedly fictional )  pilots it portrays .  it left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth .   in the march 1989  " aeroplane monthly "  ,  roland beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that raf fighter command was portrayed in the tv mini-series .  a few of his comments are worth repeating :    " there was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that i saw in action ,  and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'piece of cake' .  it would not have been tolerated for a moment .  .  .   .  .  . the prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club ,  though with more discipline .  nor was there any sense of 'death or glory' .  raf training had insisted that we were there to defend this country ,  and now we were required to do it - no more and no less .    " there was no discussion of 'bravery' or 'cowardice' .  people either had guts or they did not - but mostly they did .  but we knew fear ,  recognised it in ourselves and in each other ,  did our damnedness to control it ,  and then got on with the job .  .  .    "  .  .  . i could feel no 'glory' ,  but there was a sense of greatness ,  and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'piece of cake' .  "   beamont was ,  in his own words ,   " a fighter pilot who ,  unlike the author and producer of the recent tv series ,  was there at the time "  .   beamont served with 87 squadron both in france and the bob ,  before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the typhoon and tempest ,  and a post-war test pilot .    " piece of cake "  is an absolute ,  total misrepresentation of the way pilots in fighter command acted at the time .  it is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace .  .  . 
a hit at the time but now better categorised as an australian cult film .  the humour is broad ,  unsubtle and ,  in the final scene where a bbc studio fire is extinguished by urinating on it ,  crude .  contains just about every cliche about the traditional australian pilgrimage to 'the old country' ,  and every cliche about those rapacious ,  stuck up ,  whinging ,  tory brits .  would be acceptable to the british because of its strong cast of well known actors ,  and to australians of that generation ,  who can 'get' the humour .  americans -- forget it .  the language and jokes are in the australian dialect of english and as such will be unintelligible . 
this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle .  stallone is gabe walker .  cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists .  renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie .  stallone needed this role to get back on track .  snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ,  ice ,  cold and bad weather than finnish man .  action is good !  music in the film is spectacular .  the bad guy is john litghow ,  other stars micheal rooker  (  the portrait of serialkiller )  ,  janine turner  (  strong medicine )  .  the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie .  overall good movie ****/*****  remember extreme ääliöt :  special collectors edition ,  with good extras .  comig soon in finland straight to video . 
this is a film that can make you want to see it again .  i especially ,  liked the way it ended .  i did not see the end coming ,  but when laws was not blown away the first time ,  one suspects he will be back again .   the story is gripping and could have been more psychological ,  but i understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that .   hard to believe michael jr .  could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away .  but ,  i can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell .   some have complained about hanks as a gangster .  i believe that isn't justified .  if his character had been any harder ,  he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not .   eight stars for this one .  although it was released in 2002 ,  i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd . 
there is no possible reason i can fathom why this movie was ever made .   why must hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another ?   (  cases in point :  mister magoo ,  the avengers - awful !   )   christopher lloyd ,  whom i normally enjoy ,  was so miserably miscast in this role .  his manic portrayal of our beloved  " uncle martin "  is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal .  his ranting ,  groaning ,  grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character .   the director must have thought that fast movements ,  screaming dialogue and  " one-take "  slapstick had some similarity to comedy .  apparently he told every actor to act as if they had red ants in their pants .   fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script .  i think the writer used  " it's a mad ,  mad ,  mad ,  mad world "  as an example of a fine comedy script .  as manic as that 1963 classic is ,  it is far superior to this claptrap - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison .   what is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children .  i just am not sure whose children it was made for .  certainly no self-respecting ,  card-carrying child i know !   if they had to remake  " my favorite martian "  ,  why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic ?    unfortunately ,  imdb . com cannot factor in  " zero "  as a rating for its readers ,  that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty .   one good thing did come from this movie ,  the actors and crew were paid - i think . 
after the reasonably successful masti which was tad better inder kumar returned again with a comedy pyaare mohan based on the hollywood film see no evil ,  hear no evil   the film reminds you of hum hai kamaal ke ( 1994 )  where kader and anupam play the blind and deaf  this movie is a tedious exercise  the film has jokes of such nonsense that you don't feel like laughing like snehal dabi's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we don't laugh at now but mock   the film starts off in a clichéd manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments don't last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring the twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all ott chase scenes and fight scenes  direction by inder kumar is bad music is okay ,  one song stands out i love you my angel  vivek is awful in the comic scenes ,  his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes for some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career fardeen khan is tad better but too wooden amongst the rest esha and amrita are the heroines boman irani annoys here snehal dabbi is okay
i'm somewhat of a fan of lynche's work ,  so i was excited when i found this dvd .  unfortunately ,  i was very let down .  it's a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor .  the animation is very crude ,  no doubt done using macromedia .  each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows .    for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation ,  they will probably be somewhat impressed by it .  however ,  if you've spent much time on newgrounds . com ,  like me ,  then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you've seen before .  many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd .  if lynch submitted this work to the website ,  then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists .  but ,  since i saw this on dvd ,  instead of on newgrounds ,  i give it a 4/10 ,  instead of a 7/10 ,  as i would have otherwise .  these cartoons are fit for the internet ,  but with a name like david lynch on it ,  i expected better quality both in story and in animation . 
the beaver trilogy is ,  without a doubt ,  one of the most brilliant films ever made .  i was lucky enough to catch it ,  along with a q&a session with director trent harris ,  at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trent's website .  this movie has to be seen to be believed !  i sincerely recommend searching for trent's name on the web and then buying the film from his site .  he's an incredibly nice guy to boot .  don't get confused :  the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trent !   after having seen the trilogy a few times ,  i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version .  it's like a try-out version for the crispin glover  " orkly kid "  section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you're a penn fan than it being a good video .  penn is pretty funny ,  though ,  and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty b&w video .   this is probably also one of crispin glover's best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin' gary .  once you see this film ,  you'll never get gary's nervous laughter out of your head ever again . 
i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix .  i thought i would give their sister a try ,  rain phoenix .  i regret checking it out .  she was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it .  sissy was just weird and jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains ,  whats going on ?  i have never been so unsatisfied in my life .  it was just total rubbish .  i can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film ,  money ,  time and space .  have sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me .  i thought she was everything but that .  those thumbs were just stupid ,  and why do we care if she can hitchhike ?  whats the point ?  ?  ?  0 out of 10 ,  shame the poll doesnt have a 0 ,  doesnt even deserve a 1 .  hopefully ,  rain is better in other films ,  i forgive her for this one performance ,  i mean i wouldnt do much better with that film . 
i kind of feel like a genius ;  i feel like i'm the only one who saw through this fake film .  i watched it three times ,  once with commentary ,  and i found myself getting annoyed at all the close-ups ,  all the times the screen just blacks out ,  and worst of all ,  i feel the film never really resolves anything .  yes ,  the priest dies ,  but he didn't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief ,  or with himself .  that and he was an idiot .  if it weren't for the commentary by peter cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from ,  i wouldn't have been able to stomach it at all .  i enjoy french movies ,  but this is one that was completely absurd .   diary of a country priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but ,  that alone cannot save this deadly dull tripe .  scene after scene of extreme close-ups where characters don't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do not make an interesting or relevant story .  how this film ever became a classic is mind boggling :  it reminds me more of the emperor's new clothes .   yes ,  claude laydu's performance is heartfelt and thought provoking ,  if you are a sadist ,  but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the catholic priesthood ,  which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption .  the young priest's triumph over the countess's pride is a weak scene but 90% of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priest's melancholy thoughts .  this priest doesn't come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful .   being that i don't speak or understand french i was looking forward to doing the english subtitle thing to help understand the film .  well ,  the english subtitle is at times impossible to view/read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much i could not read  ( and i am not a particularly slow reader - i just finished dostoyevsky in 3 days )  .    i really wanted to like this film  .  i try out everything  " chosen "  by the criterion collection ,  and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod .  however ,  i sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character ,  and it never materialized .  he just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter .  and for that ,  i say it stunk . 
oh dear .  i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of japan's ringu .  well ,  i guess the u . s .  made their version of it as well ,  but at least it was an outright remake .  so ,  so sad .  i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country ,  so i can't believe this had to happen .  claudine and kris are such big names there ,  surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism .  to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines :  you do not have to stoop this low to make money .  there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them ! 
 .  .  .  and i do mean it .  if not literally  ( after all ,  i have not seen every movie ever created !  )  ,  at least ,  obviously ,  among the ones ,  the many i know .   5 . 3  ?  ?  ?  the rule of thumb with imdb is this :  sometimes movies rated very highly  ( for example ,  the piece of kannes-kompetition-krowned-korean-kraap called  " oldboy "  )  can be truly bad .  but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6 .  this movie ,  very much worth watching ,  is .  a disgrace .   true ,  i give it a 10 in protest .  the movie is not perfect .  its true rating should be an 8 or a 9 .  it has some acting flaws  ( belafonte especially )  ,  the script wanders around ,  sometimes .  however ,  what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times ,  the czech jan kadar ,  directing two of the greatest actors of all time ,  the beloved ,  larger-than-life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting/poetic/moral tour de force .  a pair made in heaven !  it's true that this movie ,  little flaws apart ,  does not pander to the average audiences ,  but those interested in watching an excellent  ( while ,  again ,  not beyond criticism )  movie of the incomparable director who gave us  " the shop on the main street "   ( the best movie ever about holocaust )  should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that  " american beauty "  is better than  " the angel levine "  .   it isn't . 
ridiculous .  this movie is actually a vehicle for the ramtha school of enlightenment .  if you are wondering who the *bleep* ramtha is :   " ramtha is a 35 , 000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in j . z .  knight's kitchen in tacoma ,  washington in 1977 .  knight claims that she is ramtha's channel .  she also owns the copyright to ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks hollywood's version of elizabethan english in a guttural ,  husky voice .  she has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as ramtha at seminars  ( $1 , 000 a crack )  and at her ramtha school of enlightenment ,  and from the sales of tapes ,  books ,  and accessories  ( clark and gallo 1993 )  .  she must have hypnotic powers .  searching for self-fulfillment ,  otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold ,  muddy ,  doorless maze .  "  john wheeler ,  one of america's finest theoretical physicists ,  would roll his eyes about this movie .  he has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory .  this movie does the same thing as those fools .   there is a great review of this movie at skeptico .  i recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult's coffers .   http : //skeptico . blogs . com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_ . html i noticed one reviewer here at imdb say to take this movie with a grain of salt .  it will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage-thinking of this movie . 
the movie is okay ,  it has it's moments ,  the music scenes are the best of all !  the soundtrack is a true classic .  it's a perfect album ,  it starts out with let's go crazy ( appropriate for the beginning as it's a great party song and very up-tempo )  ,  take me with u ( a fun pop song .  .  .  )  ,  the beautiful ones ( a cheerful ballad ,  probably the closest thing to r&b on this whole album )  ,  computer blue ( a somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia )  ,  darling nikki ( one of the funniest songs ever ,  it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia )  ,  when doves cry ( the climax to this masterpiece )  ,  i would die 4 u ,  baby i'm a star ,  and ,  of course ,  purple rain ( a true classic ,  a very appropriate ending for this classic album )  the movie and the album are both very good .  i highly recommend them ! 
i loathed this film .  the original phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery .  like many 70s horror flicks ,  it looked and felt like some creepy ,  unfinished documentary .  phantasm ii ,  from the late 80s ,  pumped up the action ,  but maintained this nice attention to mood .  sadly ,  phantasm iii is just awful .  it tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films ,  which diminishes rather than expands their power .  it shamelessly degrades imagery from the first phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original .  there are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs .  hundreds hang from the ceiling like christmas balls swaying in the draft .  didn't anyone-- the prop master ,  the dp ,  the editor ,  the director-- notice or care that they looked so crummy ?  even worse ,  phantasm iii presents one corny ,  unfunny joke after another .  how different from the intensity of the first film .  the original phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death .  phantasm iii uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about reggie's horniness :  several refer to the film's  " flying balls "  ha-ha ,  oh ,  i get it ,  balls .  maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes ,  but they are on us . 
 " they all laughed "  is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary .  it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past ,  but seems more contemporary .  even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much .  bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet ,  that reality never brings it crashing down to earth .  but ,  that said ,  this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going ,  and  " tal "  is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale .  it is a movie that wouldn't linger so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast :  colleen camp's simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog ;  blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat ;  and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says ,   " how .  .  . weird .  "  it's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it ,  but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one's face . 
those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on .  this is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to satan for a lot of money .  unfortunately ,  the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently ,  tearing his life apart .  there are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and ,  of course ,  the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time .  the middle part is a bit dull ,  but the faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer .  one thing i have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie .  also ,  they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing .  i first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it .  i was not disappointed . 
this film concerns purportedly non-establishment types  ( aesthetically and sexually )  who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs .  although some excellent players take part ,  including jon tenney ,  timothy olyphant ,  and cynthia nixon ,  they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue ;  which isn't .  nixon's role possesses the best lines ,  but she often homes in on them too quickly ,  a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director .  the grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche ,  spent or not ,  and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy . 
as an ordinary movie-watcher i can't say i enjoyed watching this one .  it's not too emotional for a drama ,  not too gripping for a thriller ,  not too fast for an action .  plus ,  some moments of the movie are hardly credible .  ok ,  i understand ,  soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there ,  but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life ,  carjack into the middle of a hostile city ,  and after being shouted at by a professor's wife run away ,  without having asked a question  ( in a proper way )  .  it would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so ,  but it's supposed to be a serious film about war .  .  there are several episodes like this ,  so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie ,  and it needs considerable work .   it feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier ,  but all these 'curves' of his psychology seem simply unnatural .   this picture left a question in my head :  why ?  why they gave it an oscar ?  why six ?  and imho it's the most thrilling part of the movie  :  ) 
playwright sidney bruhl  ( a wonderfully over-the-top michael caine )  would kill for a hit play .  enter young wonder kid  ( a solid reeve )  who's just written such a play .  weave into this bruhl's overly hysterical wife  ( superbly played by cannon )  and a german psychic  ( a very funny irene worth )  and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick .   while not up to  " sleuth "  standards ,   " deathtrap "  is none the less a very capable ,  twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by ira levin .  the performers are obviously having a field day with the material ,  with caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto .   the film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall  " deathtrap "  is solid ,  well acted and suspenseful fun . 
- bad stuff :  this movie is real crap .  bad stunts for one thing ,  they looked so fake i thought this was  " the twilight zone "  .  the flashbacks are pretty much useless .  one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better .  i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting ,  even from the adults was horrid .  a kissing scene in this movie even sucked .  this movie killed the book .  the book was great .  i highly do not recommend this movie .  not even for educational purposes .    - good stuff :  i don't know what i can say really .  there is some suspense parts that get you going ,  but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting .    - my verdict :  do not watch . 
the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring .  some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor .   there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script .  lena endre was good looking as always .   i don't remember the original movie so i can't say if it's better or worse .   if you enjoy movies like sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at . 
i second the motion to make this into a movie ,  it would be great !  !  i was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game .  i have played it again and again  ( over 20 times )  just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time .  final fantasy eat your heart out !  !  this should be made into a movie !  !  !  !  !  if anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie ,  please contact me .  i would love to help with that project any day .  the graphics are great for ps1 and even make you forget it is ps1 most of the time .  the multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play . 
no  , i'm not kidding .  if they ever propose a movie idea ,  they should be kicked out of the studio .  i'm serious .  their movies are exactly the same in every one ,  and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations ,  having a problem which they easily resolve ,  hoping to be popular ,  and getting new boyfriends .  think about it .  if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot ,  contact me and tell me its name .  these  " movies "  are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries .  there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters .  i'm sure that when they were really young and made some o . k .  movies ,  some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years ,  or something ,  so that now that they're ,  what ,  17 ,  they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studio's money .  let me advise you ,  stay away from mary-kate and ashley !  it's for your own good ! 
this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world .  john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie !   " sam "  hits close to home ,  is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with .  ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with .  i'm sure i've met arthur in my travels somewhere .  all around ,  an excellent choice to pick up any evening .  !  : - ) 
when you add up all the aspects from the movie---the dancing ,  singing ,  acting---the only one who stands out as the best in the cast is vanessa williams .  .  . her dedication ,  energy and timeless beauty make rosie the perfect role for her .  never have i ever seen someone portray rose with such vibrancy !  vanessa's singing talent shows beautifully with all the songs she performs as rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me !  her dancing is so incredible ,  even if as some people say the choreography was bad---her dancing skills were displayed better than ever before !  i'd recommend this version over the '63 just because i find that although lengthy the acting by vanessa is superb-----not to mention the fact that jason alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive as well  ( with the exception of chynna philips .  .  . what in hell were they thinking when they cast her ?  )   all in all i'd say this version is wonderful and i recommend that everyone see this version ! 
what can i say ?  i know this movie from start to finish .  it's hilarious .  it's an strong link to my past and will change the way i view film in the future .  hypothetically speaking  :  )  the down-fall ?  there's no socrates johnson ! 
i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me .  most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up ,  show off sexy models ,  and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window .  with that said ,  the bourne series has been fantastic .  doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style ,  showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly .  this is not the sci-fi absurdity that was bond  ( before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less )  .  there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out .  with director paul greengrass taking over ,  what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair .  the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it .  greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment ,  the bourne ultimatum .  in what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy ,  the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised .   once again ,  bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses .  someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story ,  he is assumed to be the mole .  only pamela landy ,  she who was on the case to find him in supremacy ,  knows that he can't be the one .  bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace .  it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them .  what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer .  the film ,  then ,  becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends ,  or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him .   in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series ,  with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story ,  it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression .  this is not a detriment at all ,  however ,  as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot .  admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight ,  between bourne and the cia's second asset ,  alone .  the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own ,  but when they finally meet up ,  we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see .  also ,  rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films ,  we instead get around three small scale road races ,  just as intense ,  but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony .   after five years of waiting ,  we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling .  by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him .  no one could have done it better than matt damon .  he has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences ,  but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him .  joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job ,  but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox's character ,  from the first two films ,  took matters into his own hands .  needing a role in that mold ,  we are given a nice turn from david strathairn .  like cox ,  he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision .  with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country ,  you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing .  even the little guys do a wonderful job ,  like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything ,  albert finney as a man from bourne's past and possibly key to his origin ,  and edgar ramirez as one of the cia's operatives sent to take bourne out .  ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen  ( identity )  ,  karl urban ,  and martin csokas  ( supremacy )  .  he doesn't talk much ,  if at all ,  but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino .   in the end ,  one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them .  his skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott ,  but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts .  rather than feel like over- production ,  his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action .  let's also credit cinematographer oliver wood ,  who shot all three bourne films .  he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them . 
i wasn't going to watch this show .  but ,  i'm glad i did .  the critics of this just don't get it !  it's one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on t . v at the present moment !  though ,  when the interviews were done with common folks they probably seemed useless ;  but ,  put them in the mouth of animals and insects ,  and it's a laugh riot .  i laughed so hard ,  i had tears in my eyes .  the pig with the babies suckling and her mother is priceless .  the husband and wife birds talking about health problems ,  and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was constipated completely broke me up !  creature comforts is the most imaginative show i've ever seen in awhile !  hopefully ,  it will be back next summer when this run is over . 
first of all i just want to say that i love this show !  !  !  but this episode .  .  . this episode makes a mockery of the entire show .   i don't know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series .   there is no story line ,  everything is chaotic and the jokes .  .  .  .  . are crap .   the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game .  .  .  .  .  for example  " how do the furlings look like "  by creating that stupid  " previously on .  .  .  "  .  .  .  .  .  . is simply embarrassing .   its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad . 
this film sat on my tivo for weeks before i watched it .  i dreaded a self-indulgent yuppie flick about relationships gone bad .  i was wrong ;  this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed-up libidos of new yorkers .   the format is the same as max ophuls'  " la ronde ,  "  based on a play by arthur schnitzler ,  who is given an  " inspired by "  credit .  it starts from one person ,  a prostitute  ,  standing on a street corner in brooklyn .  she is picked up by a home contractor ,  who has sex with her on the hood of a car ,  but can't come .  he refuses to pay her .  when he's off peeing ,  she answers his cell phone and takes a message .  she runs away with his keys .   then the story switches to the contractor ,  who pays a professional call on a rich ,  bored new york woman ,  who plays with him until he is aroused ,  then she pulls away .  she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is ;  he tells her how beautiful she is ,  and lucky .  as he is leaving ,  she asks if he would have sex with her .  she sits on top of him ,  bounces up and down .  this time he comes ,  the he leaves .   the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends .  hubby  ( robert )  is talking business ,  wife  ( ellen )  is bored ,  and switches the subject to sex ,  and how often men and women think about it .  husband switches conversation to desert .  later ,  after the guests leave ,  ellen tries to entice robert into sex .  robert wants none of it ,  and puts on a jazz record .  ellen turns on the radio ;  robert turns up the music ;  ellen turns on the tv ;  robert turns on another tv .  cacophony ensues .  ellen goes up on the roof ,  robert joins her .  ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men ,  men other than robert .  robert says that he too needs to experience men .   we next follow robert as he visits an artist ,  martin ,  played by steve buscemi .  i wish buscemi could have more roles like this ,  where he is a sexy ,  smart ,  totally desirable guy .  robert praises martin's work ,  much more than it deserves ,  promises to get it into a show .  martin is excited ,  until it turns out that robert is speaking out of his groin ,  it is all a mating dance .  robert tries to kiss martin ,  on the lips ,  and martin pulls back ,  saying that he is not gay .  robert asserts that he's not gay either ,  martin scoffs .  both admit that the artworks are bad .  robert is about to leave ,  when martin allows robert to kiss him .  they make out ,  and robert goes down on martin .   next we follow martin ,  as he prepares for an art show at a manhattan gallery .  he is smitten by the receptionist ,  anna ,  played by rosario dawson .   ( i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words )   .  .  .  and they make love to each other .   we next follow anna ,  who is sitting at a lunch stand .  her boyfriend ,  nick  ( adrian grenier )  ,  enters ,  bearing flowers .  she is cold toward him ;  he tries to figure out why .  he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in san francisco .  she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex-gf while in san francisco ,  and had sex with her .  the latter revelation turns out to be a lie .  the two of them make out in the luncheonette ,  but she decides that they must break up .  nick is heartbroken .   and we follow nick ,  who confesses his troubles to an older woman who he meets on a park bench ,  joey  ( carol kane )  .  joey is sort of weird and child-like ,  but is a good audience for nick ,  who needs a sympathetic ear .  the two of them go to coney island at night ,  and look at the stars .  nick falls under joey's spell ,  despite the age difference between them .  they go back to joey's apartment ,  and nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman .  she is on top of him ,  doesn't want to let him go .  but he manages to escape .    ( this is ,  by the way ,  the best carol kane role since she played latke's wife in taxi .  )  joey's phone rings ,  and it is a man calling the psychic friends network ,  and joey is one of the psychic friends .  although she is still hurting from nick ,  she gradually gets into her psychic shtick .  the man is at his office ,  late at night ,  and wants to have phone sex with her .  although that is not joey's business ,  joey goes along ,  and coaxes the man to come .  she wants to keep talking ,  although the man want to get off the phone ,  and finds out that he has embezzled a lot of money from his company ,  and will be found out tomorrow .  his life is ruined .  joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide ,  and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend ,  that she cares about him .  and she does care about him .   but the man packs a gun into his briefcase ,  and goes off to seek a prostitute on the brooklyn waterfront ,  and we come back to the beginning ,  to the same prostitute who started out la ronde .  she wants to give him $75 , 000 in cash if she will kill him .  he tried to kill himself ,  but couldn't do it .  the prostitute does not want to do it ,  but he insists ,  holding her hand ,  holding the gun inside his mouth ,  telling her where to aim .  eventually ,  the gun goes off ,  and we see the prostitute walking down the street ,  and arriving at the corner where she normally does business .  the contractor who didn't pay her earlier in the movie drives up ,  rolls down the window .  they look at each other .  the end . 
yes ,  i sat through the whole thing ,  god knows why .   it was a long afternoon ,  i had nothing to do ,  it was bitterly cold outside ,  okay ,  those are all lame excuses but they're the only ones i have .   i gave the darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - i have seen worse films ,  but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom--poor script ,  poor acting ,  bad lighting ,  and cheesy special effects .   the storyline ,  which never completely makes sense ,  revolves around this simple little family ,  daddy ,  mommy ,  and little girl--that i assume the viewer is supposed to be  " identifying "  with ,  all three of them were tedious and annoying .  you just want the dark side to get every one of them .   daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars .  daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the  " mysterious "  orient .  rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as  " the darkling "  .    during the course of the film ,  the darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things :  a shadow without a person ,  the inner darkness that exists in all of us ,  and the devil .  so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy--because trust me ,  it doesn't really matter .   the darkling's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion--it gets a human companion--and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being .  this ,  of course ,  leads to immense wealth ,  followed by disaster ,  for the human who hooks up with the darkling .   and for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long ,  tedious movie .   
anthony mann's westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre .  he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart - in mann's films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience .  in winchester '73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance .  here it is a  " i trust only myself "  attitude ,  which leads to one complication after another .  even before the film properly begins he  ( as jeff webster )  kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute  ( we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive ,  or they tried to steal the cattle )  .    he meets his match in skagway ,  the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson .  skagway's boss is a so-called law man named gannon  ( john mcintyre )  who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the  " gold rush "  jefferson  " soapy "  smith and judge roy bean .  the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money .  stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so  ( as a penalty fine )  the herd is confiscated  ( to be sold later for gannon's profit )  .    stewart is partner with ben  ( walter brennan - who oddly enough won his last oscar playing judge roy bean )  .  they are also joined by rube morris  ( jay c .  flippen )  and also meet two women ,  the sophisticated rhonda castle  ( ruth roman )  and the friendly and helpful renee vallon  ( corinne calvert )  .  rhonda works closely with gannon ,  but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle .  however ,  she has a similar  " i only trust myself "  attitude to jeff .  she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson .  he ,  ben ,  and rube go but at night  ( while the others are asleep )  they go back and steal back their cattle .  renee follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following .  jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border ,  although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang him .   the reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson ,  jeff opting for a longer and safer route .  after he is proved right ,  they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields .  the herd is sold to rhonda ,  and jeff ,  ben ,  rube ,  and renee start prospecting .  there is soon two groups in the town of dawson .  one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town .  but the mounties won't be setting up a station in dawson for months .  the other ,  centering around the  " dancehall "  run by rhonda ,  are in cahoots with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers  ( robert j .  wilke - really scary in one sequence with chubby johnson and jay c .  flippen ,  jack elam ,  and harry morgan )  .  jeff wishes to steer clear of both ,  and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah .  but will they get there ?  and will jeff remain neutral ?   the performances are dandy here ,  including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers ,  but would otherwise be peaceful enough .  brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers ,  whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results .  flippen is a drunk at first ,  but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewart's own words against him .  mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond ,  but his work in mann's films show his abilities as a villain  ( such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in winchester '73 )  .  he is ,  as is said elsewhere on this thread ,  really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor .  roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being ,  whose fate is determined by her better feelings .  and calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier  " gigi "  aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman .   best of all is the canadian rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of monument valley by john ford .  mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film ,  and the viewer will appreciate the results . 
maybe i'm missing something because i've read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews - and i just don't get it .  i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak ,  look ,  and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura .  none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it .  take the lead actor ,  lee j .  cobb .  his rumpled ,  rolled-out-of-bed look is about as far from the dashing ,  smooth-talking noir archetype as you'll find .  or ,  take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example .  this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i've seen in a while .  she's just not convincing in the role .   as for the plot ,  it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre .  i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes .  and that final cat-and-mouse chase scene is plain old dull .  ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it . 
i'm going to go on the record as the second person who has ,  after years of using the imdb to look up movies ,  been motivated by nacho's film ,  the abandoned to create an account and post a comment .  this was hands down the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life .  the plot was on the verge of non-existence ,  and none of the  " puzzle-pieces "  added up in any way whatsoever .  the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing .  how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me .  the only saving grace i could find was anastasia hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word .   ( and brilliant sound design )  if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores i would be up against a difficult decision .  i'm disappointed that i am unable to give it 0 stars . 
yeah ,  stupidity !  i just finish watching and i still have bad taste in my mouth .  too much colors ,  too much unnecessary  " addons "  to a story ,  too much stupid characters  ( i presume they wanted to achieve comic relief ,  but i only wanted to cry )  .  .  .  too much of everything .  shame to spoil one of divine stories from  " arabian nights "  like this .  childish ,  naive  ( both on a bad way )  and with lot of magic-breaking mistakes ,  i don't think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes .  princess is lovely ,  but should be tongueless ,  cause actress don't know how to carry a role .  rest of the cast is even worse .  .  . our  " bad guy "  is really bad .  shame that the  " good guy "  is not better .  only light in this dark is ,  of course ,  david carradine ,  who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this ,  but at least keep his actor/ " fighter "  skills at top .  i'm still sorry to see him in a thing like this ,  but glad that i had something to watch in whole charade ,  so thank you david .  only ,  only ,  for him ,  i give this 2 stars to this fiasco .  .  . i would give more for him ,  but that would rise final score to entire movie .  the rest is so bad ,  that i would ,  maybe ,  like to grade it ,  but there is no grade lover then 1 here ,  and i think that would be too much . 
if this is based on the true-life relationship ,  as purported ,  between ms .  curtin and mr .  levinson ,  i'm thrilled i do not know them personally .  this is painfully slow ,  and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground .  many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy . 
most of the episodes on season 1 are awful .  . there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits ,  as they programs actually had decent story lines .  most of amazing stories are well dull .  . not amazing in the least .  . go rent or buy the twilight zone series .  .  . i have heard season 2 of this series is much better .  . also for some reason on the dvd's they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation .  the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 .  .  . most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering .  .  . 
this film is ,  in short ,  a cinematic masterpiece .  the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer .  the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child .  in fact ,  they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them .  later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium .  here we see what life has wrought on each of them .  one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient .  another man is a hustler who has become ill .  the third child ,  a young lady ,  has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium .  this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche .   this film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving .  the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written .  there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film .  this is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience . 
there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set .  that 70's show is a great example .  when the show came on the air ,  nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton  ( both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests )  i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character ,  eric ,  and his close circle of friends .  ashton is already the john travolta of our time .  remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough ,  think of ashton with demi moore .  the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it .  i miss mo gaffney who played don's girlfriend joanne .  i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie ,  the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that .  i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde .  i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlie's angels .  i loved brooke shields playing jackie's mom .  she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway .  this show has been a delight with many surprises .  i hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but i hope they don't stay too far away too long .  i wish the show's creators ,  bonnie and terry turner ,  who also created my other favorite show ,  third rock from the sun ,  is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show .  the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future . 
***possible spoilers***  i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences .  ron ely is just right as doc .  cool ,  calm ,  almost always in control ( and with an occasional twinkle in his eye )  .  what more can one ask for ?  i have never read a doc savage book ,  so i don't know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring-do .  many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark ,  which i don't think is fair .  the difference in budget is astounding ( raiders must have at least 10 times the budget )  .  doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has .  special effects are also at a minimum but come on people ,  the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right .  the sousa music is catchy ( love that theme song- every time i watch the film ,  i end up humming the theme for days )  . the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy .  highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas .  not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib  ( really !  )  .  overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day .  i give it 7 out of 10 .   doc savage ,  doc savage .  .  . thank the lord he's here ! 
so i finally saw the film  " my left foot "  last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is .  .  .  the central performance of day-lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing ,  but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less .   the fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man ;  the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk .  on the one hand i can see that this is a logical correlation ;  mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable ,  and disability shouldn't obscure that .  i just wish that impartial onlookers wouldn't be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable .  they don't .  acting out is normal ,  and so yes ,  disabled people act out - but they don't do it because they're disabled ;  they do it because they're being unreasonable .  a physical impairment doesn't afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public ,  just because someone you love turns you down .   there are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able-bodied .  giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them .   ( admittedly ,  i did once save a penalty from the school's star striker with my face ,  but i already belonged by then .  it wasn't for acceptance .  )  engaging in a bar brawl is another .  revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you've proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far .  all of these things are stupid ,  and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesn't make them any less foolhardy .   so yes ;  just because you've overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesn't make you any less of a jerk .  .  .  being a good person takes priority ;  setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list . 
i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television ,  but unfortunately ,  started a job that got me working evenings .  i managed to catch some recordings of it ,  at least .  .  .  and ,  of course ,  purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series .  watching the dvd ,  you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first ,  but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done .  the voices are well suited to the characters ,  and the writing is excellent .  it's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it's roots by reintroducing adult themes .  thing is ,  with the way society has come in the last century ,  you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today's standards in order to be recognised as an adult-oriented show .  the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life .  it's your typical sitcom in that regard ,  but the humor is more like what you'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live .  .  .  back when snl was actually funny .  good job ,  dreamworks .  perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going .  .  .  and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it's high costs .  it's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though .  hmm .  .  . 
this film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called grey owl in 1930s canada .  i found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'rudy' and 'awakenings' .  it picks up late in grey owl's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period .   the film is about a canadian indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped beaver .  he also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of earth's resources .  this is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received .  he becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen .   the casting of pierce brosnan seems rather odd ,  but is not outrageous .  anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand .  brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does annie galipeau .  galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent bond films .   i would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama ,  beautiful scenery ,  or environmental causes .  it is a movie for families as well ,  however children under 10  ( depending on maturity )  would have trouble following the plot . 
i don't know why ,  but for some sick reason ,  i think since i've been on the disney sequel binge ,  i decided to just go ahead and see 102 dalmations .  the first movie that was a remake of the disney cartoon classic starring glenn close as cruella de vil ,  it seemed like a sure hit ,  but it was just a bomb .  i think the reason why these movies don't work is because 101 dalmations ,  the original ,  was a cartoon ,  it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults .  this was not really that fun because it's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings ,  i understand they're trying to make sure that it's appealing to the kids ,  but it's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film .  and 102 dalmations's story isn't really that good .   cruella de vil has been in prison for a while ,  but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being .  but her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper ,  but she buys a man's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she's changed .  but when she sees her probation officer's dalmatians ,  she goes crazy and starts seeing spots ,  and she looses it .  she's back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that dalmation coat she's always wanted .   glenn close is such an amazing actress ,  very under rated ,  but her taking on cruella de vil ,  she's good ,  but let's face it ,  this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case .  also ,  as cute as the puppies were ,  it just works more for the animation ,  it sounds stupid ,  but it's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix .  i wouldn't really recommend 102 dalmations ,  it's alright ,  but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time ,  this is just the same thing .   2/10
this was an incredibly stupid movie .  it was possibly the worst movie i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through .  i cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
i have seen it .  it's not  " good "  but interesting in an understated way .  the boys in it are quite naturalistic but .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . the graphic/gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and -oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance .  real atrocity is real- this film is just atrocious .  however ,  the film has a look which can draw you in .  but it seems to me that is the  " emperor's new clothes "  ,  but in fact in reverse .  the film looks good ,  but the direction ,  story ,  content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous .  if a feeling can be vacuous-this is it . 
bela lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to dracula .  he is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old unspenseful horror films this movie doesn't set the mood very well .  even at its worst any of bela's movies is only mediocre though . 
how cynical are the writers ,  to pander so .  i may be an american citizen ,  but i don't need to see other americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film .  i'm astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic ,  sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is .  the historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in  " u-571 "   ( which changes british submariners to american ones )  but you still walk away feeling a little slimy .  really ,  the germans in this film do nothing but admire the americans between battle scenes !  how sad ,  unnecessary !  i'd just like to say to the writers :  it's obvious to many of us that you can't capture real people ,  with real problems ,  under real pressure ,  and that you've taken some very well tested shortcuts .  lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugar-coated tripe . 
if you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the american league pennant race satisfying .  on the other hand ,  if you are hanging around waiting for kill bill volume 3 or sin city 2 then you probably should stay away .  the plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends ,  girl meets guy's friends ,  and guy meets girl's parents scenes .  there is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene .  that's all par for the course in a movie like this .  however ,  what i liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky .  the plot centers around answering the questions ;  how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks ?  it is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down  ( if we admit it )  we all have quirks .  barrymore does a very good job in her role and fallon sorta surprised me -- he's good as well .  i rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy .  add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one .  add another point if you are a red sox fan and subtract two points if you are a yankees fan . 
******spoilers******  the unfunny radio quiz show host kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for lugosi ,  karloff ,  and lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland ,  sporatically watchable haunted house spoof .  lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress' fortune ;  karloff is the butler and lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums ,  but it turns out that they're both in conspiracy with lugosi .    of course ,  kay kyser and his band of 30-something year old  " kids "  uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way .  not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist . 
i have always been interested in anything about bigfoot ,  so when i was browsing around looking for a movie to rent ,  this one caught my eye .  it was the worst $4 . 50 i've ever spent and i want my money back !  please don't waste your money on this !  !  this was one of the cheapest movies i've ever seen .  the entire movie was so incredibly boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i didn't even watch it all the way through .  i just got fed up with it .  the acting was horrible ,  the effects were horrible ,  everything was just really bad and tasteless .  it all added up to be a really bad ,  boring movie and total waste of time and money .  i hope that one day they'll make a good movie about sasquatch ,  but until then ,  i'll have to sit through countless cheap duds like this one to find the real masterpiece . 
no fireworks despite violent action .   science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed ,  largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention ,  and unfortunately for its producers ,  this work is lacking on both counts ,  woefully so in the case of the latter .  with essentially no budget with which to operate ,  it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and ,  in particular ,  special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish ,  while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found .  among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment ,  and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly ,  but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility .  the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth ,  with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer paolo mazzucato ,  whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus .   
i too was intrigued by the high  ( 8 . 5 )  rating for this film ,  and was very disappointed .  i had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row ,  but it was not to be .  i went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way .  there is not much of a plot ,  if any .  i don't necessarily need that in a movie ,  but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in .  the best i could say would be that it aspires to be an altman-esque film ,  albeit with an extremely small ensemble .  sure ,  there are moments ,  but a few moments easily get thinned out by 97 slow minutes of nothing .  i do not understand the high rating for this film .  i give it a 3 .   
jackie chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and police story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late ,  great bruce lee .  if enter the dragon bared the so-called bench mark of lee's greatness in the 70s ,  then the same can be said about police story and jackie chan in the 80s .   forget about the rush hour trilogy ,  or any of his us efforts- the one film that really typifies chan's excellence ,  not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking ,  bone-crushing kung- fu talisman ,  as well as his movie career was this ,  police story- the first in a series of successful cop films ,  set in mainland ,  present day hong kong .   i've seen many of his efforts- likewise the us-based rush hour ,  rumble in the bronx ,  the medalian and the tuxedo to name- and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to police story .  in those movies ,  we saw a less 'dumbed down' version of jackie ,  of whom didn't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum ,  not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as drunken master ,  police story to name .    the stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie .  the shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed :  the flying shards of glass ,  chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town ,  and chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with .    considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm's way ,  jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one ,  is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert .  especially as he has the bruises to show for it .  thus ,  he has proved that he is no one-trick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves .   story-wise ,  there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative ,  it makes up with its end-to end action and fight sequences .  as for the dialogue ,  well it's not a really huge aspect of the film- which is why most fans of jackie's and martial arts films are more interested in action ,  as opposed to the story .   unlike say the matrix ,  there are no wires or cgi ,  or any form of computer trickery involved .  what you see is what you get- and what you get with police story is a great jackie chan epic ,  full of action and pulsating stunts . it is miles better than rumble in the bronx ,  rush hour and all his other american efforts .   police story is an excellent film and one i'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice jackie chan fan ,  but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first . 
a couple ( janet and richard )  go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp .  after camping and enjoying nature ,  the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house .  soon ,  a pair of escaped convicts show up and ,  after much delaying of the inevitable ,  they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcage .   this last house on the left-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made .  it's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers .  moreover ,  i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's perverse tone .  i love caged terror .  the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty .  i found the film to be quite creepy .   the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film ,  which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering .  while i didn't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question ,  i do think that it will both most people .  the acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue ,  at least in the early scenes .  this film takes a little more patience than usual ,  and it's really not for everyone .   in short ,  this was a good film .  not the greatest horror film i've ever seen ,  but it is certainly a lot of fun .  it's not exactly the easiest film to find .  it's possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough .  it's not for everyone ,  but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out . 
small college town coed od's ?   ( why do we care ?  )  acting sheriff investigates the incident .

le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film ,  a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director ismaël ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas cazalé and mohamed majd to carry the emotional impact of the film .  ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of katell djian  ( a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters )  and the musical score by fowzi guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys .    reda  ( nicolas cazalé )  lives with his muslim family in southern france ,  a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage .  his elderly father  ( mohamed majd )  has decided his time has come to make his hadj to mecca ,  and being unable to drive ,  requests the reluctant reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation .  the two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through france ,  into italy ,  and on through bulgaria ,  croatia ,  slovenia ,  and turkey to saudi arabia .  along the trip reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights ,  but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands .  on their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman  ( ghina ognianova )  who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by reda ,  a turkish man mustapha  ( jacky nercessian )  who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting reda drunk in a bar and disappearing ,  and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons .  tensions between father and son mount :  reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps ,  and the father cannot comprehend reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs .  at last they reach mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to reda .  the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning .  it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age ,  between son and father ,  and between defiance and acceptance of religious values .    the visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects .  nicolas cazalé is a superb actor  ( be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'the grocer's son' )  and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film .  another fine film from the film movement ,  this is a tender story brilliantly told .  highly recommended .    grady harp
i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing ,  he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor .  like many others on here ,  i don't know how to categorize this film ,  it wasn't scary or spooky so can't be called a horror ,  the plot was so wafer thin it can't be a drama ,  there was no suspense so it can't be a thriller ,  its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project .  people who liked this film used words ,  like  " ambiguity "  and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn't there .  like the blair witch ,  people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying .  this movie actually started off well with the family  " meeting "  the locals after hitting a deer .  it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes ,   ( well over half the film )  ,  nothing happened ,  the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining .  it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie .  finally ,  when something does happen ,  its not even clear how the father was shot ,  how he dies ,   ( the nurse said his liver was only grazed )  ,  and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects .  the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way ,  the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied ,  i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself .  it didn't . 
when this was released ,  i thought this was one of the most profane films ever made .  however ,  thanks to martin scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him ,  there have been mainline films worse ,  language-wise ,  than this .  .  .  . but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears .  hey ,  i can take a lot of it ,  but this got ridiculous .  in the first six minutes alone ,  i heard a half-dozen usage's of the lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words .  i wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 ?  i couldn't have been the only one .   not surprisingly ,  some of the feature actors included jennifer jason-leigh ,  burt young ,  jerry orbach and rikki lake .  since this film ,  stephen lang seems to have improved his image ,  at least playing the godly  " stonewall "  jackson in  " gods and generals .  "  lang's role here is just the opposite :  perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film .   depressing ,  gloomy ,  semi-pornographic ,  repulsive :  these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some liberal critics - in describing this story ,  which is painted even worse in the novel .  of course ,  some of the better-known critics ,  all extreme libs ,  praised the movie .  however ,  they were the only ones .  most critics were disgusted ,  as well almost all of the paying public .  it's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this .   trust me on this :  there are no good ,  likable characters in this entire movie .  this is a mean ,  sick film :  one of the worst of the  " modern era .  "  that is ,  unless you enjoy seeing child abuse ,  drug abuse ,  teen prostitutes ,  on and on - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people .  no thanks . 
young and attractive japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again ,  this time it involves mobile phones .  various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed ,  so essentially if you've seen more than 2 recent japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied .   the main attraction here is the fact that takashi miike is behind the camera .  so far i've been more impressed with his low key works like city of lost souls ,  however as one missed call plodded along i was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of dead or alive or the overly pseudo-cronenberg style of audition .  despite a lot of his films being essentially empty ,  at least they do have merits such as these ,  or at least something to keep your attention like tadanobu asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating johnny depp .  there's none of that in one missed call ;  there's just very little of credit :  the acting is bland and average ,  there is very little  ( nothing ,  in all honesty )  in the way of scares or suspense ,  and in places it's just downright boring .   however ,  there are moments where miike's glacier-like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism ;  most notably with the instance of the tv show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects ,  and the tv programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls' life .  but aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is miike behind the camera ;  most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace  ( and that includes his famous gore )  ,  although it's more likely he just didn't have any enthusiasm for the project ,  and i can understand why .  one missed call isn't offensively bad .  it's just frustratingly average .   miike obviously loves directing .  with his huge yearly output it's obvious he isn't going to be 100% concerned about all his projects .  but even with this in mind ,  one missed call felt like he was just paying the bills . 
i love westerns .  i could watch them all day .   " the good ,  the bad ,  and the ugly "  is my all time favorite .  i watched  " silverado "  for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt .  however ,  this movie ,  shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched .  the acting was terrible all around .  they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing .  the only good part i can think of is the good-looking cantina girl .  the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length .  this movie wasn't even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store .  i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing .  only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end .  i turned it off half way through because it was so bad .  to the director ,  please do a better job if you decide to make another .  this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns . 
it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression .  it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace .  a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball .   likewise ,  an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema .  the presence of a radio in just about everyone's house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world's events and provided many a drama and  ( especially )  comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality .   the literature of the time also flourished at all levels .  the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it ,  what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures .  but the comic book just did not magically appear ,  all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages ,  all by itself .  there were mediums that were ancestral to them .  obviously , the newspaper comic strip was one parent ,  providing the visual/narrative method of story telling .   the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine .  the inexpensive ,  prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going ,  though not necessarily serialized ,  tales .  the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough's tarzan and johnston mcculley's zorro .  the 1930's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow ,  the avenger ,  g8's battle aces and the spider , master of men all found their way to the news stands ,  among many others .   one other was doc savage ,  a full-blooded super hero of the written story ;  the covers of the pulps had perhaps ,  the only  " picture "  of the hero .  possessing extraordinary strength ,  super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect ,  doc was the prototype super hero .   he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small ,  free lancing team of adventurers .  each of them was an expert in a given field .  so we had a top rated :  chemist ,  lawyer ,  construction engineer ,  electrical engineer ,  geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist ,  etc .   the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40's ,  and were published into the middle '50's .  then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years .  then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new  " container "  ,  the paperback book .  a fresh look to the cover art was introduced ,  featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc ,  with a perpetually ripped shirt .   the re-introduction proved to be highly successful ,  with the publication of a title a month  ( and for a while more )  .  soon ,  there was a rumor of a doc savage movie !  but when ,  by what producer ?  well ,  the venerable  " man of bronze "  was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together .  it was veteran stop-action animator and producer of top special effects films ,  geoprge pal ,  who did the film along with warner brothers .   when doc savage ,  man of bronze arrived in the movie houses ,  it boasted of a well casted team of actors ,  albeit a largely  " no name "  as far familiarity with the viewers .  with former tarzan of tv , ron ely's nearly perfect casting in the lead ,  up and coming beauty of a starlette ,  pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler  ( as the villainous ,  captain seas )  ;  no other name would have been recognized .  and ,  just maybe that was a plus in this case .   the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going .  use of narration ,  by paul frees ,  and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story .   from the very start ,  there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured  " camp "  humor as the batman tv series .  some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected ,  unlikely outcomes .   ( for example ,  an experiment of doc's with a miniature rocket/missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish ,  a small one at that .  )  the whole story unfolds like that ,  hitting the viewer with a little 'camp' every so often ,  as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously .  we are also puzzled about mr .  george pal's being the producer ( his last )  .  he who had been so well known for special effects ,  surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci-fi action setting of the pulp character's world .   i can remember seeing it quite vividly .  mrs .  ryan  ( deanna )  was in the hospital ,  just having given birth to our 2nd child ,  michelle ( 08/14/75 )  .  our older girl ,  jennifer ,  was visiting her grandmother ,  so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward ,  it was straight over to the old marquette theatre ,  63rd & kedzie ,  here in chicago .   having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc ,  i was sort of let down by the final product .  i could accept a little of this 'camp' business ,  but would not have objected if mr . pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp/comic/serial type excitement .   and yet ,  the cast ,  headed-up by mr .  ely and the others ,  made the whole film likable ,  if not lovable .  the sets and locations were ,  as far as we can see ,  very much like those of a '30's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone .   and maybe that's just what they were trying for with this doc savage ,  man of bronze . 
this was the worst mtv movie awards ever !  !  !  i barely laughed ,  none of the presenters were funny ,  the hosts really sucked ,  and the parodies weren't so great either .  why can't we go back to the good olden days when the show was a riot ? 
now ,  i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash .  .  .   i appreciate the fact it's a spoof ,  but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing ,  acting and dialogue .  seriously ,  this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen - it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper ,  and a poor one at that .  .  .   okay - a few criticisms  ( 1 )  when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster  ( we never see the monster attack him ,  so we assume its a heart attack )  ,  the army then launch shells ,  rockets ,  bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive  ( 2 )  the army attack from about 100 yards away ,  and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez ,  those things have a range of no more than 30 metres !   ( 3 )  when the monster tries to take the professor ,  the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling ;  the monster drops the kid ,  and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster ?  ?  ?  come on !   ( 4 )  the monster looks like it something out of power rangers !   ( 5 )  there is one scene where the five  " good guys "   ( the priest ,  the girl ,  the doctor ,  the reporter and the kid )  all look shocked and we get reactions  ( along the lines of hand to mouth )  one after the other - so natural !   ( 6 )  the general just runs away ,  time after time  ( 7 )  the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn't listen  ( 8 )  the acting is awful  ( 9 )  did i mention the rubber suit monster ?  ?  ?  ?   ( 10 )  that god-awful music ,  non-stop ! 
worst bob hope comedy ever ( and that includes some heavy competition )  .  hope ,  on an island with sailors ,  dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl  " steering his ship "  .  somebody certainly steered this hope-hackery over the cliff ,  as it features phyllis diller and gina lollobrigida and still can't work up any laughs or excitement .  where's bing crosby when you really need him ? 
kolchak is sheer entertainment .  great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down .  darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him .  simon oakland ,  jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having .  some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes - erik estrada in legacy of terror ,  phil silvers in horror in the heights ,  antonio fargas in the zombie .  it's easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files .  darren - rip .  simon - rip .  ruth - rip . 
if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing .  the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery ,  and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about .  however ,  there is not much tension ,  and williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy .   collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear .  the production felt rushed and holes are apparent .  it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort .  the book is probably better .   one thing is certain :  taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort . 
i think i've seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor ,  except for the rainmaker ,  but this one is so bad it's unbelievable  warning spoilerish  it's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do .  he's a lawyer for christ's sake .  why when his children go missing does he not call the police .  oh yes it's because all the police hate lawyers so they're just ignore him and let him be attacked .   when he's arrested for murder they just let him go free ,  he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing .    why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home .   the police don't bother to try and find an escaped mental patient ,  they don't bother to interview his daughter .   as for the ridiculous ending .   in summary ,  silly ,  very unrealistic and a complete waste of time .   0/10  one of the worst films ever made . 
 " the dream child "  of 1989 is the fifth film in the  ( generally overrated )   " nightmare "  series ,  and at the latest from this point on ,  the series became total garbage .  the only good films in the series were wes craven's 1984 original ,  and the third part ,   " the dream warriors "  of 1987 .  the second part was disappointing and boring ,  and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes .  this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for  ( admittedly great )  visuals ,  and one creepy scene ,  a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence .  the rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester yelling stupid one-liners ,  and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses ,  who desperately try to avoid falling asleep ,  because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams .  lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson ,  and a bunch of uninteresting crap ,  such as a super-dumb 'eerie' children's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel .  .  .  in short :  no originality ,  just a decline of the old formula ,  and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes .  my  ( generous )  rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals ,  and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel ,   " freddy's dead "  ,  which is awful beyond belief .  in case you're not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast ,   " the dream child "  should be avoided ,  and even if you are ,  this is more than likely to disappoint . 
the plot of goodnight mr tom on paper makes it seem we are in for a large dose of maudlin , sickly sentiment . but , talented director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right manner , and it emerges instead as a compelling , deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances . one of the best , if not the best tv movies of the 1990's which possibly would've had even greater success if it had been released in the cinemas .   the evacuation of children to countryside towns and villages in world war ii was of course a common practice , but in the case of the young boy here was doubly important because of a wretched home life in the uk's capital . the horrors of war on the home front are not drifted over though , and the construction of the film until it's throat-lumping , misty-eyed ending leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before . it is almost ( but not quite ) worthy of comparison with the finale to it's a wonderful life ( 1946 )  . all in all , a modern classic . 
distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise .  .  a sort of multi layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right at this moment .  to be more concise ,  he feels that his wife is cheating on him ,  so he hires a private eye to snoop on him .  his wife has no idea that this is happening .  meanwhile ,  the actors in this play are also having a few whoopdedoodles up their sleeves by fooling around with each other and with ,  shall we say ,  unscrupulous people in the world of israel .  the whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable  ( but not really )  happens .   the director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters ,  and edits in a way that makes you pay attention ,  this is a fun film actually ,  one which i didn't mind viewing and would recommend people check out . 
ying ,  a chinese girl who speaks czech ,  invited us to screening of a czech movie  ( with english subtitles )  in the department of visual and environmental studies  ( ves )  .  it was the first time i saw samotá&#345 ; i  ( loners ,  2000 )  and it was pretty good .   much like in many other czech movies ,  the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult ,  dirty life ;  the web indicates that this theme was popular among the u . s .  movies in the early 1990s .  their relationships are breaking up ,  combining ,  and recombining .  another typical feature of the czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either .  also ,  you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context ;  that's a very realistic feature of the movie's psychological analysis .   ond&#345 ; ej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters .  nevertheless ,  you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman ,  hanka .  he is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into hanka's parents' house - a house that he repeatedly burns .   meanwhile ,  hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents .  she just decides - by tossing up a coin - to break up with petr who works in a private radio station .  hanka does not view her parents' bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment .  but she is a very flexible figure ,  as far as the type of her boyfriends go .   for a while ,  hanka seems to have serious plans with jakub ,  an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs .  however ,  the friends from his band inform jakub that he already has another girlfriend .  hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents .   when hanka and petr break up ,  it is organized by robert ,  a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary czech people to japanese tourists .  robert - who also provides jakub with marijuana - is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women ;  eventually ,  his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression .   vesna  ( a slavic word for  " spring "  )  who came to prague from macedonia works as a barmaid - and you won't learn whether she came to czechia in order to see her dad or ufos .  she seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems .   petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job - a job that he eventually loses .  he announces to his audience that he broke up with hanka - which is how ond&#345 ; ej learns about the news that make him very happy .   finally ,  ond&#345 ; ej's wife lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage - even after ond&#345 ; ej asks a magician to make him disappear so that ond&#345 ; ej can try to capture hanka again .   ( the magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident - jakub and hanka bring the victim to the hospital and ond&#345 ; ej saves his life .  )  lenka also works for the travel agency - as a translator - and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during hanka parents' dinner .   the seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude .  given the actual size of the czech capital ,  it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people ,  but it is fun . 
this movie is little more than poorly-made ,  fetish porn ,  and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era .  this was recommended to me by friend as a  " unique film experience .  "  he was right .  i suppose he meant that as a joke .  not disgusting ,  not even that shocking .  just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art .  a little bit of camp value ,  though i don't believe the makers of this film intended this .  and yes ,  as a previous reviewer mentioned ,  it's sex with a guy in a bear suit .  don't spend a lot of money on this .  try to borrow it ,  if you must see it .  or contact me ,  i'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price .   i may have to see another of this particular director's films ,  as he seems to have a certain following .  but if it's anything like this ,  i will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever . 
this one is considered a key pre-code film  from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story  ( 1946 )  ,  but also the paranoid sci-fi invasion u . s . a .   ( 1952 )  !   and features one of barbara stanwyck's best early roles .   she's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day  george brent ,  douglass dumbrille ,  edward van sloan ,  nat pendleton and john wayne  ( at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname ,  derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout )  in the former category and ,  in the latter ,  robert barrat  ( as stanwyck's father )  ,  donald cook  ( as her most tragic conquest )  ,  alphonse ethier  ( as her elderly mentor  more on this later )  ,  arthur hohl  ( as a lecherous politician )  and henry kolker  ( as cook's boss and father-in-law ,  whom stanwyck also seduces )  .  curiously ,  scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors !   abetted by crackling i . e .  typically hard-boiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets ,  the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our small-town heroine by the intellectual ethier  ( stanwyck complains to him early on that she's no  " ball of fire "  which ,  of course ,  contradicts her later comedy  directed by howard hawks and co-starring gary cooper  of that name !  )  .  under ethier's auspices ,  she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success ;  the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one  relating to an ambitious statesman's lust for power  in sergei eisenstein's october  ( 1927 )  !  sociologically ,  it's also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid/companion .   the first two-thirds of the film are simply terrific ;  at first ,  i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly-introduced george brent character while he ignores herbut ,  just like the others ,  he's soon under her spell !  on second viewing ,  however ,  this aspect felt less jarring  as it's evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused ,  and that her tenure in paris has softened her  ( even if she tries to cling to her hard-earned wealth for as long as it's possible )  .   released on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume 1 collection ,  the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed pre-release version and the tamer theatrical release print .  among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwyck's life as a tramp from the age of 14  ( though it's heard in the accompanying trailer !  )  ,  while many other scenes have been shortened  ( i . e .  censored for content )  :  the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances ;  the seduction at the railroad car ;  the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook ;  the shooting ,  followed by a suicide  ( only shots are heard in the shorter version )  ;  stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing  ( again ,  only brent appears in the version released to theaters )  ,  etc .  tha latter ,  then ,  utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version ;  however ,  we also get an obviously tacked-on happy ending  ( the pre-release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open-ended note )  and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which ,  basically ,  has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche ! 
i really wanted to like this western ,  being a fan of the genre and a fan of  " buffalo bill ,  "   " wild bill hickok ,  "  and  " calamity jane ,  "  all of whom are in this story !  add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor ,  and it sounded great .    the trouble was .  .  .  .  . it wasn't .  i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this ,  being bored to death .  jean arthur's character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like  " buffalo bill .  "  cooper wasn't at his best ,  either ,  sounding too wooden .  this was several years before he hit his prime as an actor .   in a nutshell ,  his western shot blanks .  head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one . 
this film has a weak plot ,  weak characterization ,  and really weak special effects that i question why i lost valuable life by watching it .  it has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film .  the robots are sad and the main  " hero "  'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch .  if this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable ,  but there's nothing funny about it .  the main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters ,  and he is killed .  it's sad when you root for the bad guy ,  because he's the best one to cheer for .  when all is said and done ,  this movie was better left on the cutting room floor ,  or never funded at all . 
tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie .   this type of movies are actually made for flop .  what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c-grade movies .  or even some c-grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan .  the much hyped and over-confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deserved .   in my view ,  this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films' banner .  how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick ?  he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi's ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last .  the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences .   the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences' hearts .  in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions .  i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay ,  but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif''s hand instead of akshay .  just from the starting point i expected of it ,  but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth .  saif is the main behind the whole adventure ,  while akshay joins in the midst .  in any movie ,  the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit .  and tashan loses in this way ,  and unexpectedly failed to become a hit .   akshay's has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies .  he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again .  in between saif did a great job in race ,  and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie .  but he has fully developed himself in the acting field .  and last but not the least about kareena .  she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean .  but i myself don't think so ,  instead she became slim .  yes slim !  !  !  it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people  ( or say ,  male )  .  beside them it is nice that saif's son ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young saif .  i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career .   those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood ,  or say want to be admitted in an asylum .  thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films .  in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions .   sorry ,  i don't like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies . 
i thought this movie would be dumb ,  but i really liked it .  people i know hate it because spirit was the only horse that talked .  well ,  so what ?  the songs were good ,  and the horses didn't need to talk to seem human .  i wouldn't care to own the movie ,  and i would love to see it again .  8/10
this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  jessica simpson not only lacks any acting skill ,  but the script is incredibly shallow and lame .  you actually hear serious dialogue that goes ,   " i love you more .  "   " no ,  i love you more .  "  i stopped watching the movie  ( online )  after the first half hour ,  i couldn't take it anymore .  her  " southern girl charm "  just doesn't work and is really quite annoying ;  her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page .   poor luke wilson .  did he not read the script before agreeing to do this ,  or did he fall for papa joe's  ( jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie )  promise of big profits ?  hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this .  luke wilson is actually a good actor - i hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue .   also ,  i think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by papa joe to give the movie a better rating .  no one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging .   jessica has lots of money ,  right ?  maybe buy some acting lessons ? 
if i could give this film a real rating ,  it would likely be in the minus numbers .  while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible  " horror "  films ,  seriously ,  people ,  buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time .   despite it being a horror film ,  there is nothing scary about it ,  unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché's you can fit in one movie scares you .  if the rating had been higher ,  it probably would have made for a better film in the long run .   whoever made this version of  " prom night "  ,  you screwed up .  the actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting .  this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip .  i'd sooner go and see  " one missed call "  again ,  at least that had some plot . 
 " loonatics unleashed  "  is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by chuck jones  .  the  " loony tunes "  have many spin -offs and different versions  ,  some were good  , others not very much  . but  " loonatics  "  it's the worst  . the concept is stupid and derivative of shows as  " the power rangers  "  and  " teen titans  "   .  there wasn't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made  .  the new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic  .  this show just doesn't work  . this horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this shouldn't have be nothing more than a bad joke  .  lame  !  zero stars
gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story . it's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistan . the movie's aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and it's government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won't work . and all the songs and music of the movie are all bad . most likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided . the movie sucks and sucks with power .  i think only amisha patel was good in the movie .  if i can give 0 out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1 . please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie  . disaster . 
excellent film .  the whole picture was filmed in budapest ,  so i feel proud .  my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways  ( máv )  ,  and it is plain to see that they were used in big train ,  not in the local railway - according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations .  apart from this ,  the film is superb . 
what we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80's incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash- cinema completely speechless !   " wizards of the lost kingdom "  is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy/sword-and-sorcery adventure that doesn't have an actual plot but does eagerly & shamelessly borrows elements from other films .  writer ed naha and hector olivera  ( who ?  )  watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters ,  but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically .  in order to make a fantasy-adventure you need :  one super- evil villain  ( preferably with a black cape )  ,  one young hero in training ,  one lone warrior ,  one amiable type of furry pet ,  one wise midget living in the woods  ( optional )  and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons ,  enslaved dwarfs ,  and winged gargoyles to serve as filler .  the story is phenomenal and so original ,  with simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician shurka takes over the power and killed the king .  simon wants to go back and save the people ,  but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape .  simon befriends lone warrior kor  ( the usually cool dude bo svenson who clearly needed the pay check )  ,  who assists simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals ,  dangerous encounters and magical showdowns .  admittedly it doesn't even sound too bad thus far ,  but that's merely just because i excluded all the deliciously inept little details .  simon has a best friend named gulfax ,  for example .  gulfax is an albino version of chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle-snout to yelp something incomprehensible .  the obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the  " plot "  and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content .  simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph ,  kor settles an old score with the pig-faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there's the supposedly horrible 'suicide cave' where you can only sing your way out of .  but the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence  not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema  involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors .  simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors ,  hoping they will assist them in their battle ,  but the rotting corpses only take a few steps ,  complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves .  that's it !  so much for the zombie sub plot !  best sequence ever !  i could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs ,  but you get the idea .   " wizards of the lost kingdom "  is a tremendously messed-up  " so-bad-it's-good "  film .  word of advice :  do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone .  invite friends ,  preferably the dope-headed types with a wicked sense of humor ,  and watch it in group .  it will be a night to remember
sandra bernhard is quite a character ,  and certainly one of the funniest women on earth .  she began as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s ,  but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorsese's underrated masterpiece ,   " the king of comedy "  .  her film career never quite took off ,  though .  she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures ,  such as  " dallas doll "   ( 1994 )  or  " dinner rush "   ( 2000 )  ,  but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself .    " without you i'm nothing "  is undoubtedly her best effort .  it's an adaptation of her smash-hit off-broadway show which made her a superstar  and madonna's best friend for about four years .  in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes ,  sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross ,  talks about her childhood ,  andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach ,  prince ,  or sylvester .  director john boskovich got sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance that's both sexy and uniquely funny .  if you are a bernhard fan ,  you can't miss out this film ;  it's a tribute as well to her  ( weird )  beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne .  and it has influenced filmmakers in their work   " hedwig and the angry inch "  ,  for instance ,  would look a lot different if  " without you i'm nothing "  didn't exist . 
saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it .  i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community - grit ,  determination ,  exuberance ,  creativity ,  in your faceness with a dose of desperation .  the writing ,  dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process .  great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well .  all the characters are multi dimensional - none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong .  this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth ,  hip hop and communities like jane finch . 
an intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of temuco .   film debutant daniella rios is the seductive erotic dancer gracia ,  working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new mini-wave in chilean film production ,  alejandro trejo .  the elder brother ,  played maturely by nestor cantillana ,  is easily convinced to become trejo's lead henchman ,  after a night at the stripclub to celebrate younger brother victor's  ( juan pablo miranda )  seventeenth birthday .  from the establishing shot of this opening scene ,  the film explodes into neo-noir exploration of everything the outside world doesn't usually expect to see in this country so stereotypically conservative and catholic .   gracia's charms of seduction attract the three men like bees to honey ,  although the circular narrative of the three-way fantasy romance revolves around the linear portrayal of major international drug deals between trejo's men and the 'gringo' ,  eduardo barril .  power relations become a vital theme ,  as society's outsiders merge in a mini-family .  the prostitute holds an exotic spell over all the chilean men in the film ,  emerging from her ambiguous position in the periphery of society ,  and is seen as holding the key to all three men's futures .  the relationships between trejo and cantillana become important ,  as the boys' parents are conspicious by their absence  ( one assumes they still live in temuco )  .  therefore it is trejo ,  el padrino ,  who 'adopts' cantillana ,  and effectively 'makes him' as a man in the city .  miranda rapidly becomes the desperate outsider ,  as his dependency on his 'father figure' ,  cantillana ,  becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful gracia .  however ,  miranda remains trapped by the constraint of still being in school - he is dependent on cantillana ,  who is dependent on trejo ,  for the money to survive .  trejo ,  in turn ,  is under the thumb of the 'gringo' ,  and his wealth has been accumulated through drug deals and well as his strip clubs .  the figure of gracia acts as a time bomb viewed as a beautiful firework ,  she wraps a web of beauty inside the patriarchy but the strain can only lead to one climax .   as the tensions of these power relations come to head ,  gracia remains ambiguously elusive .  the viewer is never sure which male figure she will commit to .  the film concludes tragically and explosively in a shoot out which realigns power relations and erases half the major male protanganists .  the final shot of miranda's beaten face speeding down the panamericano highway is despairingly powerful .  the boy has been sucked in by the lure of the city's underworld ,  yet has lost his only visible family ,  and his woman ,  who is his only friend in the film .  he has nothing .  the overriding metaphors are bold and brave .  this is a gangster film in chile .  the notions of family ,  no sex before marriage etc ,  are abolished ,  and instead the harsh realities of the other side of santiago's coin are displayed in all their savage glory .  trejo beats rios brutally ,  rios and miranda make love in a cinema reel room - a whore having sex with a minor she barely knows .  the 'gringos' are seen to have a financial hold over this small latin american nation ,  but not through the copper mines ,  through the illegal path of drugs .   waissbluth's triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld ,  which raises so many social questions ,  more perhaps than the record-breakingly successful sexo con amor ,  within a slick ,  smooth firecracker of a film ,  which place this film firmly alongside sexo con amor ,  taxi para tres ,  and el chacotero sentimental ,  as cinematic evidence that chile is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the post-transition period 15 years after the censorship of the military regime . 
there is no reason to see this movie .  a good plot idea is handled very badly .  in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense .  the reason for the killings are not made clear .  the acting is awful .  nick stahl obviously needs a better director .  he was excellent in in the bedroom ,  but here he is terrible .  amber benson from buffy ,  has to change her character someday .  even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed .  even though the movie was 80 minutes ,  which is too short for a good movie  ( but too long for this one )  , there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters .   don't spend the time on this one . 
1st watched 12/24/2009  4 out of 10  ( dir-robert ellis miller )  :  emotional christmas fluff that doesn't really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual-based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make christmas happen for them .  the three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to washington d . c .  to enlist the then president of the united states ,  herbert hoover .  this trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer ,  which makes the story kind of like a disney  " animals on the run "  movie and doesn't quite fit here .  at the ending ,  there isn't any details given as to how the president helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie ,  in my opinion .  the movie does eventually bring tears ,  but it takes too long to get to this .  the movie isn't supposed to have been an original tv movie ( according to imdb )  but it has the obvious fade-outs that make it look this way  so i'm not sure their information is accurate .  all in all ,  this is a simple movie ( that could have been more complex )  with a happy christmas-like story but blandly played and without a lot of substance . 
as an aging rocker ,  this movie mentions heep and quo - my 2 favourite bands ever - but with the incredible cast  ( everyone )  - and the fantastic storyline - i just love this piece of creative genius .  i cannot recommend it more highly - and mick jones added so much  ( foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever - lou gramm )  - i have watched this great work more than 10 times- bill nighy - what a voice - and jimmy nail - talent oozes from every pore - then astrid .  .  .  .  and karen .  .  .  .  .  what more could an aging rocker ask for !  !  10/10 - bloody brilliant .   alastair ,  perth ,  western oz ,  originally from windsor ,  england . 
oh my .  .  .  bad clothing ,  worse synth music and the worst :  david hasselhoff .  the 80's are back with vengeance in witchery ,  an american-italian co-production ,  helmed by infamous joe 'd'amato on the production side and short-careered director  ( thank heavens for small miracles )  fabrizio laurenti directing  .  marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi's evil dead series in italy  ( that was dubbed  " la casa "  in there )  ,  witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting .   a mix of ghost story ,  possessions and witchcraft ,  the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending ,  topped with some serious wtf surprise climax .   ( i just love the look on her face .  .  .  )  surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes ;  unluckily for him ,  these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively .   the plus sides are experienced ,  when the gore hits the fan .  this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's italo-gore ,  when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow .  i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters  ( and actors )  got mangled and misused ,  one by one .  i only felt sorry for linda blair ,  who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career ,  or so it looks like when checking out his filmography .   well ,  folks - not much more to tell ,  and even less to tell home about .  don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this ,  and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun .  it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror .  and speaking of hearts - every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors ,  must have it's one on the right place .   this is my truth - what is yours ? 
what did the director think ?  everybody who has read the biography of artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that tassi was guilty .  that fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most terrible hour she stands her man .  why do movies depicting renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic ,  are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the hollywood happy-happy-mood won ?  while i would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie i cannot make sense of turning artimisia's life story on its head .  very disappointing choice by the makers of this film . 
good ,  funny ,  straightforward story ,  excellent nicole kidman  ( i almost always like the movies she's in )  .  this was a good  " vehicle "  for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both .  a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories ,  great closing lines .  chaplin ,  very good here ,  was also good in another good ,  but unpopular romantic comedy  (  " truth about cats & dogs "  )  .  maybe they're too implausible .  ebert didn't even post a review for this .  the great  " screwball "  comedies obviously were totally implausible  (  " bringing up baby "  ,  etc .  )  .  if you've seen one implausible comedy ,  you've seen them all ?  or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s .  weird .  birthday girl is a movie i've enjoyed several times .  nicole kidman may be the  " killer app "  for home video . 
i can understand why some people like this movie ,  and why some people don't .  for me ,  though ,  i really like it ,  even if i noticed some good bits ,  and not so impressive bits .  the animation was actually excellent ,  like charlie's dream .  the characters were a mixed bag ,  the best being anne-marie ,  voiced by the late judith barsi .  ( i was physically ill when i read what happened to her )  also ,  carface is a very convincing villain , especially voiced by the wonderful vic tayback ( i particularly loved  " morons i'm surrounded by morons "  )  and along with rasputin and warren t . rat is probably the most memorable of all the don bluth villains .  charlie and itchy only just lacked the same sparkle ,  but i loved king gator and his song .  some of the film is very haunting ,  like annabelle's  " you can never come come back "  ,  which kind of scares me still .  unfortunately ,  there were some bits i didn't like so much .  the story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused ,  but disney's black cauldron suffered from the same problem .  also there were some dark scenes ,  that young children would find upsetting ,  but the ending is very poignant .  however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung .  none of them in particular stick out ,  with exception of  " let's make music together "  and  " love survives "  ,  and burt reynolds can't sing and dom deluise has done much better singing .  all in all ,  a watchable movie ,  that could have been more ,  but is definitely memorable ,  and i would definitely watch it again .  7/10 .  bethany cox
if the man in the white suit had been done in america ,  can't you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinness's sidney stratton on for size ?   this is one of the best of alec guinness's films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out .  it's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build .  it's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree .   alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning ,  that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment .    he's a persistent cuss and he does succeed .  of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society .  in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive ,  almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist .    it's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i've mentioned can be played for laughs .  poor guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent ,  but it glows like a neon sign .   other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf ,  joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk>   come to think of it ,  did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever ? 
i went to see this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in one word  ( which i normally don't use lightly )  :  wonderful !  in my view ,  the best movie ever made .  who deserves oscars and other awards if not this swedish crew who have created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film ,  when everything that is said  ( and left unsaid )  throughout the story is drawn together ?  just as the character of daniel dareus evokes so many sentiments and long repressed feelings within the people around him ,  the movie does the same to its viewers :  you walk out with your head abuzz and your heart feeling full .  great stuff !  next time you ask yourself  " what is the meaning of life "  ,  perhaps think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like as it is in heaven :  happy ,  content ,  fulfilled .  to say it with virginia woolf's mrs dalloway :   " such moments are enough "  . 
aileen gonsalves ,  my girlfriend ,  is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank .  she has a lovely scene with roshan seth in a restaurant .  there's more information on her website at >having stated my personal interest in the film ,  i have to say that i think it is a beautiful movie - moving ,  funny and beautifully filmed . 
i was subjected to this atrocity by my wife ,  tried to turn it off after 10 minutes ,  but was forced through the whole thing .  this must be ,  hands down ,  the most gruesome pretense of a movie ever .  .  .   there were great script moments ,  such as :   sammy -  " if she gets over here right away ,  she gets a bonus "  madam -  " a boner ?  "  sammy -  " no ,  a bonus "   to summarize :  horrible script ,  terrible acting and incredibly illogical . 
don't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago ,   " the sarah silverman "  is wonderfully bizarre ,  surreal ,  immature ,  ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line-up .  if silverman tones down the juvenile  " doody "  jokes and emphasizes the darker ,  meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at ,  we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled  " strangers with candy "  .  but just from watching the pilot ,  its just solid ,  not outstanding ,  offbeat dark comedy/musical but with huge potential .    silverman has created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier ,  younger ,  jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional ,  non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television .  early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i can't wait to see how this show unfolds . 
this is the best movie i have ever seen .   i've seen the movie on dutch television sometime in 1988  (  ?  )  .   that month they were showing a yugoslavian movie every sunday night .   the next week there was another great movie  ( involving a train ,  rather than a bus )  the name of which i don't remember .  if you know it ,  please let me know !  in any case ,  how can i get to see this movie again ?  ?  ?  ?  a dvd of this movie ,  where ?  ?  please tell me at vannoord@let . rug . nl  the next week there was another great movie  ( involving a train ,  rather than a bus )  the name of which i don't remember .  if you know it ,  please let me know !  in any case ,  how can i get to see this movie again ?  ?  ?  ?  a dvd of this movie ,  where ?  ?  please tell me at vannoord@let . rug . nl
tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud .  the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself .   there are a few surprises .  as cynical as we are today ,  i fully expected the 'good girl' to be crying over his grave ,  instead of his buddy's .  especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend' ,  when she first meets matt .  and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr .  allen's face ,  blinding him  ( interesting role by bruce dern )  .  wrrrooonnnnggg !  !  !  some of the other hollywood endings do happen ,  but the writing is so excellent ,  the acting so carefully wrought that you're blissfully unaware .   and the music is out of this world .  taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions' were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley .  even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago ,  but at a club called ,  wonderfully ,  'biloxi' with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks .  i'll be watching it again ,  just to hear the music .  good thing i have the factotum sound track ,  so i can listen to that in the car .  watch both together ,  and you'll see how matt has matured .  .  .  . playing bar room characters in both .  now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc ,  he probably has great opportunity to do his studies .  great actor ,  just coming into his own .  he shows finely nuanced performances  .  .  . the good and the bad in his characters .  his 'young boy off the farm' is a great study ,  made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes .  he makes love ,  convincingly as well .  since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen-ager ,  i wonder how that it  .  .  . making love to an actress you kinda grew up with .  adds conviction ,  i'll say that . 
probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever ,  badly acted and badly written .   the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm ,  but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one ,  the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll ,  or could it be one of the five characters .   acting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine ,  and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end .   the kills can't really see why they banned this ,  the kills look fake mostly ,  one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake ,  but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car ,  one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive .   overall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
after seeing you've got mail and feeling disappointed ,  i decided to see the original movie which inspired this one ,  the shop around the corner .  i was amazed at this movie .  it's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times .  the acting is so perfect ,  the story is so beautiful ,  that if you haven't seen it ,  i wish to urge you to see it today .  i'm not against re-makes and sometimes i like the new version more than the original one ,  but this time have to admit that you've got mail is a poor adaption of this classic .  don't miss it ,  go to your video store and rent the shop around the corner today ! 
this very unfunny failed tv pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th annivesery dvd special edition  " blazing saddles "  .  imagine the movie without the satire ,  humor ,  or writing skills .  but with all the trappings of a typical lame '70's sit-com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you'll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was .  what the hell was lou gossett jr .  thinking when he signed onto this disaster ?  ?  this was possibly the worst thing he's been in  ( and yes i'm including the first  " punisher "  movie and  " iron eagles 3 "  .  steve landesberg ,  i understand as he can't say no to crap .   my grade :  f
i thought this movie had absolutely no moral .  i mean ,  how would you feel if your fiancé left you on your wedding day for your cousin ?  ?  ?  i would be heartbroken !  !  it's classified as a comedy but i didn't find it funny at all .  i thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them .  i normally love julie stiles movies ,  but this is an exception .  jason lee stars in another disgraceful show ,  which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society .  it had a complete lack of taste and i despise movies like this .  i understand that people will defend this movie and it's morals because it is 'just a movie' ,  but i still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldn't be allowed on screen .  i'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie ,  you are a bad person ,  as everyone is entitled to their own opinion ,  and parts of this movie were enjoyable ,  i'm just saying that in real life ,  people acting like the characters in this film were doing is shameful . 
justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors ,  drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside ,  let's just take this movie as it's offered ,  without extraneous explanations .   this movie is god awful .  straight up craptastic .  rather than rehash what may serve as a plot ,  i'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head .   a class  ( of 5 )  take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin' nowhere ireland .  these students may be canadian or american ,  it's difficult to tell .  that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well .  one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the  " dumb jock "  character from a number of kick ass 80's movie ,  except when he channels randy from scream .  one character may be chris klein's stunt double .  he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed ,  but it's never really established if that is true .  one character is sullen and removed from her peers .  .  . just .  .  . cuz .  .  .  and then there's a blonde girl .  yay blonde girl .   ireland has a population of 2 .  they're cousins .  gary ,  who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast ,  is called  " sir "  more than once .  he's very ominous and wears a knit cap .  his cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond .   picturesque ireland features many canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes .   the producers got a discount on volume fake entrails .  good for them .   unbeknownst to me ,  horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives .  perhaps there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register .   also unbeknownst to me ,  if you inbreed for roughly 600 years ,  as the story leads us to believe happened ,  you end up being somewhat lumpy ,  yet amazingly spry and fairly strong .  genetics are a wonderful game of craps .   there may or may not be more than one freak in this film .  reference is made to  " them "  and we see shadows ,  yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever .  and when one odd looking dude is finally killed ,  apparently all danger is passed .  i'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up ,  thus they just used the one .  that's what it looks like on screen ,  anyway .   richard grieco should be ashamed .   also of note ,  aside from those shiny new knives ,  the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear ,  as once richard grieco cuts his bonds ,  there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up .  .  . who also then escapes ,  because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them ,  making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up .   a dead body in a shack will be maggot-ridden after what i would guess is about 2 hours has passed .  said dead body will also have glasses on ,  when no characters wore them .  curious .   jenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left ,  chats for 2 minutes ,  vanishes stage left .  in the middle of a giant forest .  that's not unusual ,  as gary can also pop out of nowhere ,  which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screen .   ms .  jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn't suck wind .   i offer a special nod to the  " breeder "  character ,  the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months  ( or maybe years )  for breeding purposes .  the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua .   the ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years .   apparently this wasn't just random crap i found on the movie network late at night ,  apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it's production .  how sad for you all .  i have nothing more to say .  may god have mercy on us all . 
this movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all .  i know i've personally run into this many times .  thank goodness will smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text messaging while driving .  people ,  don't do it .  an hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause .  personally ,  i wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie .  i was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn .  i decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same .  if you care about your family ,  make them watch this vital public service announcement on text messaging while driving or they could kill seven people .  thanks for showing us the way . 
you'd be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie  ( especially one entirely located inside a us prison )  - see this to prove yourself wrong !  it was produced in the 80's after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert  ( something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to $100m+ budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind !  )  being mr harlin's first major production and the - at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar - cast .  i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard's screen appearances  ( not mentioning the well overrated mr ( s )  bergman directorial efforts )  - at least for all female viewers - but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense .  do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff ,  imo it's definitely worth it ! 
basically this is an overlong ,  unfunny ,  action/comedy .  first of all i'd like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie  ( 1 )  and the sequel had it's moments .  unfortunately white chicks doesn't even deliver half the laughs .    the humour in it is absolutely crude .  if you like burping ,  farting ,  stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this .  when it isn't crude it's idiotic .  the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me ,  totally unfunny ,  simply idiotic .    however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend  ( otherwise i wouldn't have bothered )  .  the story is undeniably thin ,  it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant .  i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film ,  the laughs don't come quick enough .  some jokes are dragged out too long when they're more disgusting than funny in the first place .  if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this .  if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie ,  airplane ,  hotshots 1 + 2 .    1/10 completely unfunny ,  thin storyline ,  a film that seems to be based on one idea  ( i . e .  what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film ?  )  but simply didn't have enough material . 
the past few months i have collected voyager seasons 4 to 7 on dvd  ( i only had 1 to 3 on video before that ,  because kes is my favourite character )  and have just reached the end .  i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it .  am i satisfied with the ending ?  i think i am .  naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination .  in many ways  " endgame "  is similar to next gen's  " all good things "  the involvement of the crew in the future ,  but mainly the captain .  a new romance starting in the finale  ( troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here )  ,  which results in death in the future .  i truly loved  " endgame ,  "  fair to all characters ,  neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier .  b'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom .  tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured .  harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important .  the doctor ,  in the future ,  is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe !  but of course the captain has the largest role ,  meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties .  the borg are involved ,  as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager .  alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically ,  just her voice and acting method are magnificent .  i feel sorry for susanna thompson though ,  the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen .  maybe she wasn't available though .  the special effects are fantastic ,  the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart !  it's very tense .  especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant .  and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection ,  on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse .  voyager could have continued .  if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home ,  like in harry's speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there .  and then they could have got home in a film !   overall ,  voyager was a bit hit and miss .  the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one .  the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible !  my perception of seven of nine was that she took over ,  it all revolved around her ,  which wasn't true .  when she first appeared ,  season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that .  and her character is ingenious at times ,  20 years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity .  i like her ,  especially in  " someone to watch over me ,  "   " imperfection ,  "  and  " human error .  "  when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side ,  that was lovely .  chakotay became my least favourite character .  gone was the chemistry with janeway  ( will they/won't they ?  )  and you'd never think he was first officer ,  he's completely pushed aside most of the time .  i loved seeing tom and b'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds .  i always liked neelix a lot .  tuvok was good at times ,  especially when he lost his logic ,  gained emotion and was friends with neelix .  harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times .  the doctor is probably my favourite ,  seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates  (  " tinker ,  tenor ,  doctor ,  spy "  is fantastic !  )  .  janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it .    i wish there was more ,  i love voyager ! 
on the face of it ,  this should be a great film ,  a great cast ,  a plot with many possibilities and one of hollywood's finest behind the camera for the first time .   however ,  its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again .  this movie fails on so many levels .  in a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations ,  it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director .  not so here ,  the great cast is horribly under-used ,  none more so than the great ,  late john spencer ,  the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven't seen in a hundred other tv movies .  there is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists .  at least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
for me too ,  this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly .  in 1989 ,  i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording ,  giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself .  it's part of my family's christmas tradition now ,  and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen .   it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show ,  and they did more than one special together .  the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here ,  in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages . 
this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the 60s .  they were terrible ,  but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then stan and ollie resurgence .  new audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest .  it was to be expected .  but ,  how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of .  .  .  i can't even think of a word .  i'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival ,  but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing .  the impressionists  ( i hesitate to call them actors )  do a vegas act and that's where it belongs .  the plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days ,  trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature .  if this film was someone's first exposure to the real laurel and hardy ,  i'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok .  the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave .  and ,  you know ,  these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to stan and ollie . 
there's so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense .  some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all ,  and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence .   where's the relationship between christophe and marcel ?  where's the continued affair between marcel and juliet ?  why does dolly rose appear at all ,  since her story's never explained ?  where's the rape and redemption of marie ,  whose greatest attribute  ( and downfall )  is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to richard ?  why does the film end with marcel's beating at the hands of his father ?  we learn nothing of aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband ;  why no backstory explaining this hatred ?    as for the performances ,  there's not a one that's better than mediocre ,  though that's likely due to the lousy script .  best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard--but richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film .  worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose ,  though again ,  it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with .   all in all ,  this is just terrible .  i thought it'd be impossible for any anne rice book-turned film to be worse than exit to eden ,  but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit .  how is it that rice is such a slut she'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen ? 
 " the cat's meow "  contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue ,  and some fine performances ,  a few of which surprised me .  eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin  ( partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer )  ;  joanna lumley is compelling as novelist elinor glyn ;  and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies  ( though why movies never use her real-life stutter is difficult to explain )  .  but these elements don't add up to a successful whole .  the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes--the meetings between davies and chaplin are particularly well crafted--but not so hard on the big picture .  several minor characters don't need to be there ,  and don't behave consistently .  the basic plot is full of illogic  ( e . g .  ,  why does thomas ince think it's a good idea to tell hearst something he really doesn't want to hear ?  )  ,  and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome .  i'd like to think a trip on hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates .  davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type ,  which isn't really accurate ,  and the screenwriter's ideas about chaplin and love are implausible .    strangely ,  bogdanovich ,  who seemed so connected to the thirties in  " paper moon "  ,  lacks a similar affinity for the twenties .  he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream ,  which gives the party guests a very artificial look ,  and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period  ( e . g .  ,   " yes ,  we have no bananas "  )  .  when hearst insists everybody  " charleston ,  charleston !  "  it looks as if the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot .    the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies ,  i'm sure ,  but not this time . 
one of the most excellent movies ever produced in russia and certainly the best one made during the decline of the ussr .  incredibly clever ,  hilarious and dramatic at the same time .  superb acting .  overall a masterpiece .  score it 10/10 .    
mahatma gandhi ,  the father of the nation in his quest for india's freedom struggle ignored his own family and son ,  this movie is about his son hiralal who feels neglected because of mahatma gandhi's service to the society .  the movie starts off in south africa where mahatma gandhi works as a barrister and fighting the cause of india's freedom against the british .  hirarala arrives in south africa to help his dad who is a barrister ,  since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle ,  he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the society and as a result hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams ,  he gets married to his love gulab  ( bhoomika chawla )  against his father's wishes .  hiralal has ambitions to travel to england and become a barrister just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony .  this angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases ,  hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed .  hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt ,  he loses his wife and children .  akshaye khanna has give a stellar performance as hiralal gandhi .  .  all kudos to him ,  the direction and the script is fantastic ,  the picturization is excellent .  overall an excellent movie and a must see .  i give it a 10/10
foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly  " perfectly "  fit together .  shot by shot ,  edit by edit ,  the film unfolds itself around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose  ( or lack thereof )  .  the other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest ,  but i personally think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece ! 
this one came out during the western genre’s last gasp ;  unfortunately ,  it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field !  to begin with ,  the plot offers nothing remotely new :  james coburn escapes from a chain gang ,  intent on killing the man  ( now retired )  who put him there – charlton heston .  while the latter lays a trap for him ,  coburn outwits heston by kidnapping his daughter  ( barbara hershey )  .  naturally ,  the former lawman – accompanied by hershey’s greenhorn fiancé  ( chris mitchum )  – sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers ,  all of whom broke jail along with him .   rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-fordian style ,  mclaglen goes for a sam peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease :  repellent characters ,  plenty of violence ,  and the sexual tension generated by hershey’s presence among coburn’s lusty bunch .  incidentally ,  heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam peckinpah western – the troubled major dundee  ( 1965 ;  i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd ,  though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off tcm uk )  .  anyway ,  the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for  ( suggested also by the title )  :  then again ,  both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most american of genres – will penny  ( 1968 )  for heston and coburn with pat garrett & billy the kid  ( 1973 )  !    at least ,  though ,  heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed coburn by anticipating what his next move will be ;  the latter ,  however ,  tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax  ( relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing heston to witness his associates’ gang-rape of hershey )  .  apart from the latter ,  this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el cid  ( 1961 )  ,  the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists  ( as was his fashion ,  heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice !  )  .   the supporting cast includes michael parks as the ineffectual town sheriff ,  jorge rivero as coburn’s mexican lieutenant ,  and larry wilcox – of the tv series chips !  – as the youngest member of coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over hershey  ( while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away !  )  .  jerry goldsmith contributes a flavorful but ,  at the same time ,  unremarkable score . 
i have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show .  i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things .  i probably could if i could get past rachelle .   i'm sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer .  it doesn't work for someone who's really interested in improving the planet .   this show should be called nagging with rachelle .   since ed is such a great font of information ,  maybe a second show that's really serious about the environment would be a good idea .  dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us .    i no longer record episodes or watch the show ,  but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works . 
tressa's vocal performance was outstanding !  !  tressa played the female singer role ,  while richard was in the club .  when she first step out on stage ,  and started to riff and strut her stuff ,  it made my soul shake .  her voice is platinum .  she needs to make a cd .  she has more fans then she realizes .  i loved her show stopping performance in the five heart beats ,  which she also starred with leon when she was younger .  how can a little girl have a voice so big .  she is truly amazing . good voice good good good good voice voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice  ,  back shaking  ,  tear crying  ,  uplifting ,  take you back in the days voice .  tressa if you read this commit ,  please take my advice and start recording a cd .  if not just for the love of singing ,  but for your fans .  i believe you can truly make it .  look at these other one hit single studio singers ,  lol . 
yet another british romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for .  this feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clichéd scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare one's love .  the characters are one-dimensional caricatures save for love-hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film .  things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses ;  our good-natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending .  if you're looking for a bridget jones ,  notting hill kind of experience you won't find it here . 
because of the 1988 writers guild of america strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days .  it's pretty much crap ,  consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from season 2 and was described by its writer ,  maurice hurley as  " terrible ,  just terrible .  "    why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows .  i'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery .  this episode also marks the final appearance of diana muldaur  ( dr .  katherine pulaski )  on the series . 
in what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy ,  manuel gomez pereira made this film ,  'things that make life worthwhile .   " it is not an original discovery ,  by many voice you have  ( quite off the pitch ,  by the way )  ,  but it departs somewhat from the norm in the spanish cinema .  the downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined ,  and while some points are not well developed ,  others are out of place .  a day in the lives of two people close to the median age .  it's basically what the movie gómez pereira .  jorge  ( eduard fernandez )  is a stationary  ( parado )  one which ,  despite load on your back with a drama major ,  seems willing to see things change .  only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence .  in line with audrey tautou of 'long dating'  ( jean-pierre jeunet ,  2004 )  ,  jorge says things like this to herself :   " if i find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck .   "  of course it finds it ,  begins to play 'today could be a great day'  ( hoy puede ser un gran dia ) by joan manuel serrat and in a few crosses on its way hortensia  ( ana belen )  . she is another woman entry age ,  divorced and a little lonely .  take valeriana for sleeping ,  organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother ,  said her belief in god and leads to a speed of homicidal mother .  hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior ,  life was going in his head driving data as  " 70% of people fall in love only once in a lifetime "  and said although it is short of jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a  " sadistic "  sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity .  later came a communion ,  a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet ,  the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer .  'things that make life worthwhile' debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and ,  conversely ,  make us take the case as a comedy ,  focusing on things like a chinese singing at a wedding  ( which seem to be amusing in itself )  or the gait of a drunk person .  the problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players ,  therefore we can not identify with the dramatic ,  and not give us a solid base comic too ,  leaving everything except pure joke .  in the end ,  all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn ,  and ends up not doing either .  and it is true that something is not seen a thousand times ,  is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner ,  but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do .  ana belén  ( which apparently far less than the 53 years that has in this film )  and eduard fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working ,  but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film ,  so in moments like the  " accident "  with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands .  perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do ,  but that is no excuse to lower our guard .  in any case ,  both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function .  'things that make life worthwhile' work only up to the modest level of entertainment .  any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled ,  as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that ,  we presume ,  they wanted to do ,  can not afford to have little moments finished successful  ( beyond bad )  as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh ,  lost drunk ,  compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him .  neither do much for people like rosario pardo ,  making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase  " must be screwed over ,  "  and songs from the soundtrack ,  though significant ,  not just fit .  it is true that the film by manuel gomez pereira has its hits  ( some of the moments involving jose sacristan )  ,  but the whole is a anodyne story ,  a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better . 
have not watched kids films for some years ,  so i missed  " here come the tigers "  when it first came out .   ( never even saw  " bad news bears "  even though in the '70s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie ,   " warriors ,  "   " man who would be king ,  "  and  " rocky horror picture show ,  "  among others .  )  now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on .  just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job .  lo and behold ,  i spied wes craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer .  he'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the  " scream "  movies .  maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic .  more surprising was fred j .  lincoln in the cast credits as  " aesop ,  "  a wacky character in the movie .  f . j .  lincoln ,  from the '70s to just a few years ago ,  appeared in and produced adult films .  he was associated with the adult spoof  " the ozporns ,  "  and just that title is funnier than all of  " tigers "  attempts at humor combined .  let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel . 
i totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie .  this is a totally sucked movie .  i mean sucked - s . u . c . k . e . d .  the story development is strange .  mia kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party-fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all .  in addition ,  all the actresses looked way too old for being college students - college students looked like about 30 years old - you figure out the rest .  i watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes .  all the sex scenes are lame ,  hasty and ,  most importantly ,  no frontal at all .  all the sex scenes are laughable ,  considering how many clothes they had on .  do yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks .  conclusion :  story - 0 ,  sex - 0 ,  acting - 0 ,  score - 0 out 10 . 
this is the first american film to successfully adopt the naturalistic style used by europeans ,  particularly the french and belgians ,  for at least a decade ,  and isn't it about time ?  following three high school girls in the crown heights neighborhood of brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between freshman and sophomore years ,  it does what all good art should :  it discovers the universal in the particular .  even though the girls' preoccupations are outwardly conventional--boys ,  sex ,  popularity ,  money ,  freedom ,  and clothes--we glimpse how their whole lives are being shaped ,  the universal interface between character and destiny .   the naturalism is whole ,  complete .  the film breathes ,  stays in the moment ,  inhabits real time .  the story tells itself .  the medium and its artifacts ,  for once ,  are not the message .  the film unwaveringly ,  truthfully conveys the childhood perspective of its characters ;  it does not impose its own adult meanings or morals .  details emerge of their own ,  are never pushed ,  and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement .  even though great pains have been taken to capture the authentic social reality of crown heights ,  part of the largest black ghetto in new york city and one of the most dangerous violent places in the us ,  the subject is childhood in the ghetto ,  not the ghetto itself .   documentary footage of the practice sessions of a marching band ,  the jackie robinson steppers ,  punctuate the film at regular intervals with an explosion of color ,  movement ,  and sound .  otherwise ,  the camera stays very close ,  very intimate ,  a patient ,  sly ,  and unobtrusive observer .  the language is rich ,  spontaneous ,  the acting transparent .  some scenes standout ,  such as the girls lolling about ,  each revealing her deepest fantasies .  lanisha's confession of her acceptance of a death by random violence is the most shocking ,  one of the deepest scars of the ghetto .  her sharing with her mother her confusion and fear before the stark challenges of adult life is equally moving ,  and beautifully ,  unsentimentally affirmative .   social realities are respected ,  not propagandized :  all three girls are being raised by single moms ,  only one ,  lanisha ,  has a father active in her life  ( and ,  not coincidentally ,  of the three she is the most emotionally stable and empathetic to others ,  and the one with the most self-respect )  .  two of them suffer from asthma ,  a disease disproportionately prevalent in the inner city .  gunfire ,  an accepted daily occurrence ,  only momentarily interrupts their conversation .  only one of the girls ,  joy ,  feels hope for ,  feels she has control over the future ,  while the other two to varying degrees have already accepted despair .   this is by far the best dramatic american film i've seen in years .  see it ,  see it ,  see it . 
working from a script written in part by nicholas pileggi ,  best known for writing the book wiseguy ,  which he adapted into the movie goodfellas ,  and for writing the book and screenplay casino ,  director harold becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs ,  even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like pappas ,  who is regarded as a presidential prospect .  as cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report ,  his skepticism is agitated .  how did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence ?  we meet the other players in the plot ,  not the least of which is danny aiello ,  the political boss of brooklyn ,  and tony franciosa ,  the mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead .  how and why these people are affiliated i leave to the movie to divulge ,  though there are never any misgivings that they are .   the narrative is told generally through the eyes of the cusack character ,  a visionary from louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him .  much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations .  some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite ,  but considering i just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge ,  one can't say it doesn't work .  the shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk :  a charge by aiello for a subway stop and an off-ramp in brooklyn to aid a new banking center ,  and the city's bid for the next democratic convention .  individual idiosyncrasies are also explored ,  including aiello's emotional bond with the music of rogers and hammerstein .   much also is made of menschkeit ,  a yiddish expression ,  which ,  pappas explains to his deputy ,  is about the bond of honor between two men ,  about what happens between the two hands in a handshake .  this connection doesn't mean much to bridget fonda ,  the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears .  little by little ,  the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law .   there are various scenes of hard impact ,  including one where the brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day ,  his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked ,  and then the mafia boss drops in by surprise .  there is also a compelling ,  and markedly conjectural ,  late scene between the mayor and his deputy .   one scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child ,  in a harlem church .  his advisers tell him he won't be wanted there .  but he goes anyway ,  and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole ,  pacino and his character both .   it gets an impressive reaction from the congregation ,  but the mayor knows ,  and his deputy knows ,  that it was artificial ,  and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it ,  in the limousine taking them away ,  is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo .  this is a script that knows it has to supply pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him ,  and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech .   pacino and cusack are convincing together throughout the movie ,  the older man unbreakable and aware ,  the younger one anxious to learn ,  but with ideals that don't sway .  pacino is innate with his down-to-earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination ,  inspired flair and matter-of-fact realism .  cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness .   the bridget fonda subplot development is unnecessary ,  but it is a result of veteran screenwriter paul schrader's otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character ,  and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments .  aiello ,  for instance ,  is a highlight because he evokes his character's joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment . 
like others ,  i have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the clutter killings ,  including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho-mythology of the participants to the crime -- including capote himself .  as to capote ,  i cannot forgive him for willfully withholding perry smith's confessions ,  intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels .  i believe truths and facts capote  " reserved "  for his  " book ,  "  which required for capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment ,  would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for perry smith even under the old mcnaughton rule .  capote himself could never write another major literary work after  " in cold blood .  "  shame and guilt .  in my opinion ,  he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book/drama .  to him ,  both men had to die for his book to succeed .  the book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment .  his actions and silence assured that ice-cold conclusion .   capote's book is not truth .  it is not factual or journalistic .  it is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination .  what most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of capote's mind ,  which may have been the most cold-blooded aspect of all .  no wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer blake's performance .  that actor is the nightmare from capote's dishonest imaginings .   so who is to say how the two killers should be played ?  who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to  " do it now "  killing ?  i agree with the few who see in eric roberts' work a magnificent performance ,  shakespearean in its range ,  yet played with heartbreaking sincerity .  anthony edwards takes a much safer  " attitude mode "  to create a smarmy hickok ;  but he is one-dimensional and boring ,  with only a few notes in his television range .  roberts is almost four-dimensional ,  adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body ,  a frankenstein creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what not to do .  like leopold apropos loeb ,  robert's perry smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man .  without hickok or a man of his particularities ,  perry smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors .  he fears himself more than he fears anything else in life .   given the freedom from capote's death grip on the consciousness of the clutter killings ,  roberts and edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama .  same facts ,  some of the same lines from the case record ,  but deeper ,  more complex ,  with clearly titanic psychotic stresses -- indeed roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is .   what many of our reviewers dislike about this film ,  roberts in particular ,  is that cold-blooded killing isn't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand .  that is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic  " interpretation of life and death "  than capote could ever create -- a real tragedy .   the actual cold-blooded killer ,  mr .  capote ,  and his hypocritically artistic  " non-fiction novel "  do not control these interpretations and performances .   if  " in cold blood "  and capote's effect on life ,  literature and truth matters as much as scholars say ,  then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth ,  or a version of the truth ,  that is not the rank ,  cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of capote's own abyss . 
to sat how awful the shield is ,  you'd have to write pages and pages ,  so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directing .    " when directors go awry "  should have been the title of this production .  indeed ,  directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling that propels the story forward .   how is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a  " style "  ?  how is it propelling the story forward ?  of course there's also the  " editing by random numbers "  nonsense .  apparently it's become hip to just cut randomly .   i guess it's too much work to do good editing .   well ,  that made it too much work for most people to watch the shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched shows of all time . 
it's a funny business ,  reviewing movies .  these days when  " internalized emotions "  and  " emotional detachment "  are favored over straightforward sentimentality ,  it must be hard to stay faithful to your true feelings .   soon after completing jury duties at the 58th berlinale ,  i managed to catch yoji yamada's kabei .   after the screening ,  i watched folks dreamily amble out of the theatre hall ,  watery-eyed ,  men ,  women ,  and reviewers alike .  even the director of the berlinale ,  obviously a hardened viewer of cinema ,  confessed to having been caught unawares and found himself crying three quarter's way into this unashamedly sentimental experience .   but what really surprised me were the reviews that came after .  despite being ineffably moved by the film ,  many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally non-committal in their writing .  apparently ,  post weeping ,  they had put on their  " thinking cap "  ,  and consequently ,  missed out on what i felt was the genius about kabei .   allow me to explain .   set in pre-war japan ,  the story of kabei revolves around one writer's family ,  and their fate therein ,  after he is held in jail for what was described as  " thought crimes "  against the imperial will .  through a series of protracted emotional scenes ,  yamada gets us familiar with the man ,  his loyal wife and two daughters ,  as well as three side charactersthe man's pretty young sister ,  a bumbling ex-student ,  and a cad of an uncle  all come to help the family cope with their plight ,  in the absence of the man of the house .   the story moves along at a slow albeit steady pace ,  and heartbreaks occur at precisely the moments everyone is able to predict .  this of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic event .   in other words ,  although you learn to love the family and their helpers ,  and sympathize with their unfortunate situation ,  you get so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of ending .   however ,  two hours into the film  ( don't worry ,  yamada provides the viewer with sufficient moments of gravity and levity to tide you along )  ,  he slaps you with what i can only describe as  " the sting "  .  all that you have assumed to be what the story was aboutan innocent man wrenched from his faithful wife and daughters  now suddenly points to one of the family helpers .  someone you have hitherto taken for granted is now thrown into an unexpected twist of fate .   at this point ,  something curious happened in the theatre i was in .  everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition .    " my word !  "  i muttered under my breath .  it struck me then that  " kabei "  ,  in the final analysis ,  was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war .  it was ,  in fact ,  a cunning examination of one common human foible :  how little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us .   now ,  the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid ,  but lacked innovation .  that's what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap ,  i guess .  with kabei ,  i believe yoji yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch on one unique aspect of humanity .  a wicked old trick he so seamlessly applied in the tora-san series ,  and later ,  in tasogare sebei .   after lulling the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone ,  he throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in cinema .   this ,  to me ,  is the most effective cinematic tool of all .  one which avoids detection ,  but affects you deeply .  and proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of kleenex ,  thrown into a litter bin just outside of that thousand-seater cinema hall .   now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about .  human emotions .  pure and simple . 
are highlights of this 1917 feature .  the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies .  on an island off the coast of scotland ,  the villagers live the simple lives of  " fisher folk .  "  my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read ,  but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery ,  and the camera work on boats is splendid .  maurice tourneur directed pickford in this pleasant film .  pickford was already a major star in 1917 ,  and this film seems to have been written just for her :  plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune .  pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny .  and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done .  not a great picford film ,  but still worth seeing .  matt moore  ( pickford was married to his brother ,  owen moore )  is the love interest ,  and is good as the strapping island lad .  leatrice joy is one of the villagers but i couldn't spot her either .  my copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung .  very effective . 
i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie . it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990 . a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment . winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors , drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television . i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure . it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever . we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish . we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect . it is a true gem . the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever . if you see this movie for rent in a video store , steal it . you won't regret it ! 
i don't think i'll ever understand the hate for renny harlin .  'die hard 2' was cool ,  and he gave the world 'cliffhanger' ,  one of the most awesome action movies ever .  that's right ,  you little punks ,  'cliffhanger' rules ,  and we all know it .   sly plays gabe walker ,  a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend ,  hal tucker  ( michael rooker )  ,  assist in a rescue on a mountain peak .  walker obviously came back at a convenient time ,  because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen  ( john lithgow )  .  qualen & co .  have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u . s .  government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back .  .  .   essentially ,  'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone .  just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains ,  complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal .  naturally ,  that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough ,  as stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease ,  and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects .  after all ,  isn't that what action movies are all about ?   'cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around .  a showcase of great scenes and stunts .  one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie ,  and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning ,  it maintains its action awesomeness .  john lithgow's lead villain is entertaining ,  and one bad dude .  quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever .   'cliffhanger' is easily one of stallone's best efforts ,  definitely renny harlin's best effort ,  and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
alone in the dark is one of my favorite role-playing-games of all time .  i remember spending whole nights facing the pc screen ,  trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in .  now ,  mind you - i am weary of  " computer-game-generated "  movies .  i don't remember a single success story in this new hollywood genre ,  although some are entertaining enough to be watchable .  and yet ,  i am such a big fan of the game that i couldn't resist .  my rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's ,  it would be ok .    man ,  those were 90 minutes  ( which seemed like 300 )  of my life that i'll never get back .  if i had that chance ,  i would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead .  this isn't even in the  " so bad it's funny "  category .  you would think even christian slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb .  now ,  tara reid .  .  .  i'm not complaining about her presence .  however ,  if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene ,  - which i totally understand and support  ( hey ,  i'm a guy !  )  - i've seen more of her body on press conferences .   there is no plot to speak of .  won't waste your time pitching it to you .  the credibility of the story sinks below 'i did not have sex with ms .  lewinski' .  the acting is but a few notches above 'street fighter' ,  which ,  by the way ,  being one of the worst movies i've seen ,  i would recommend over this one .   kids ,  i recommend the video game .  it has far better story ,  acting and much more thrills .  as for the movie ,  here's a spoiler - it stinks !  wait for the porno version . 
a slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of neworleans black women by white men of power and privilege .  ooh .  does that whet your appetite ?  well ,  then ,  belly up to a vhs or dvd and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history .  for good measure ,  it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack anne rice .  the directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog .  most of acting is amateurish .  the production's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors ,  all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today's market  ( jasmine guy ,  ben vereen ,  pam grier ,  eartha kitt )  ,  including some faces that have barely been seen at all  ( bianca lawson ,  rachel cuttrell )  .  it also is ,  despite itself ,  a sterling showcase for nicole lyn .  the pompous and ponderous james earl jones is on-hand as well .  so ,  is the late ossie davis ,  a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary negro ensemble company .  this film should be rated  " t "  for tripe . 
this movie catches a lot of flak ,  but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered / clothed version of the film that played us television and has also been issued to death on vhs and dvd buy companies like alpha ,  unicorn ,  etc .  this movie never had a theatrical release in the states ,  although it was picked up by avco embassy in 1973 .  in spain at the time ,  when there was nudity involved ,  the filmmakers shot two versions ,  one with clothes and one with out .  the fully uncut english dubbed export print was titled werewolf never sleeps and seems to have been released to home video only in sweden back in the 80's .  it can be found on ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended .  my guess is avco cut the film down for a r rated release that never happened .  in 1974 it was released by avco to television titled fury of the wolfman and the clothed version was used for this tv print .  cut to 12 years later and fury of the wolfman pops up on home video on the charter label .  this version appears to be what avco was going to release back in '73 .  it's the uncovered version ,  with some nudity that would never pass on tv or in a pg movie .  there are several scenes on the charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the tv print  (  the source for all those dollar dud's and vhs editions  )  .  but a comparison to the fully uncut wolfman never sleeps reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version !   (  spoilers in next paragraph  )  the scene where ilona has waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete .  after whipping him into submission ,  she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf !  !  !  the werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too .  this scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat .  it's not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for us audiences ,  or more likely the mpaa .  ilona is desperately in love with waldemar and could not possess him ,  hence her whole scheme to mind control waldermar's wife and involve her in an affair .  she wanted to wreck his marriage ,  and she accomplishes this while waldemar is in tibet .  unfortunately he returns a werewolf ,  but this does not slow her down a bit .  if she can't physically have him as a man ,  she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf .  this also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window .  this scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense .  in the uncut version ,  it would seem ilona's affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release ,  so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping .  the other cut is a complete scene of waldemar in bed with karen and she is seen naked .  a very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the us version of werewolf shadow  (  werewolf vs the vampire woman  )  as well .  the film does have it's problems though ,  for certain .  the director was drunk ,  the bad stand in for the werewolf at points ,  the atrocious english dubbing ,  the inclusion of sequences from the first waldemar film mark of the wolfman aka frankenstein's bloody terror and the grotesque overuse of that film's music score throughout etc ,  but seen in it's original widescreen format and uncut  (  ie :  werewolf never sleeps  )  it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the daninsky werewolf series ,  with a plot line unmatched in it's everything but the kitchen sink approach .  the cut / clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors ,  and unfortunately that's the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen .  the film carries a 1970 copyright ,  and i'd bet the 1972 release date on the imdb is incorrect .  the film precedes werewolf shadow  (  aka werewolf vs the vampire woman  )  in the series and was certainly released before werewolf shadow .  the ending of werewolf never sleeps / fury of the wolfman dovetails directly into the opening of werewolf shadow ,  offering concrete evidence of this .  sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release .  a perfect release would be the uncut english version but in spanish with english subtitles .  the english dubbing severely hurts the movie .  but any spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in spain during the franco era ,  where nudity was verboten . 
this is one of the few movies released about a  " what if "  type of situation that made me think .  it was amazing to hear them speak to each other ,  and reminisce about all the wonderful  ( and not so wonderful )  things that happened between them .  i actually think that there is a very good possibility this occurred like the movie implies ,  and they actually made peace with each other .  those are good memories for every fan to hang onto ,  and to ask what actually happened between them would be selfish .  what an amazing movie this was .  the comedic aspects of the movie were wonderful .  to think that they were together to patch things up between them in such a way is a comforting thought to people who wish they had a chance to clear the air with someone they didn't get to .  to see john as such a caring ,  laid back character was refreshing from hearing all of the trash that was spoken about him .  .  . 
just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and worse of all a bizarre almost hollywood-like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie  ( this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends !  )  .   you will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones .  the conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided .  i didn't understand why the author had the local black communinity behave in such an unacceptable manner ,  is he / she trying to be racist ?   a truly bizare movie .  only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happened .   but on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent . 
i loved this episode .  it is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world .  i also love this episode because kyle gallner  ( bart allen/impulse )  and justin hartley  ( oliver queen/green arrow )  are guest starring in it !  !  !  i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe !  !  = ) it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next .  i think chloe should also join the team as watchtower ,  that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesn't have super powers .  also ,  i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for 33 . 1 ,  i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have !  !  ! 
there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism .  this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it .   it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15-year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action ,  to the humour and even to the beautiful music score .   i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk ,  i will certainly be adding it to my collection . 
cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill sci-fi flick .  the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on .  the close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive .  the sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie .  the technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive ,  however ,  the director makes good use of the props .    the character development is intentionally shallow .  the main character ,  jeremy northam ,  decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage .  it's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end . 
the only thing remarkable about this movie ?  is that all the actors could bomb at the same time .  idiocy .  i want my money back .  .  . and i got it free from the library .  sheesh .  i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again . 
kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories ,  reno hightower .  robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack dundee .  he dropped the big pass in more ways than one .   you'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film ,  as jack hisses at a rat ,  reno poses ,  and the call of the caribou goes out .   don't miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played . 
this movie was awful .  the ending was absolutely horrible .  there was no plot to the movie whatsoever .  the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones .  their performances were excellent !  the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice .  if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story ,  it would be worth watching .  instead ,  robert duvall's and james earl jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline .  .  . or lack thereof .  not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie .  .  .  . well an actual movie .  .  . not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason .  it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time .  there was nothing special about any of the characters .  the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling ,  senile ,  drunk ,  old man .  nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end .  when the movie ended ,  i sat amazed .  .  . amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while .  it never happened !  the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning .  it wasn't even a story .  the entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time .  that's it .  it was one day in the life  ( and death )  of some southerners on a plantation .  how much of a story can take place in a single day  ( other than the movie training day )  ?  the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent ,  but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie .  .  . if you can even call it a movie . 
this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep ,  and that's meaning it as a compliment .  because of the success of very british comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the twentieth century ,  most notably adaptations of e .  m .  forster novels ,  this very merchant-ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 .  it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson ,  having appeared as the wife of jeremy irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage ,  and as the ira terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in the crying game .  here ,  she plays a quiet ,  serene type of woman in rose arbuthnot ,  one who with josie lawrence who plays lottie wilkins ,  embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery .  they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies :  one caroline dester ,  played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very vamp louise brooks  ( and not just in the style of hair she wears )  ,  and mrs .  fisher  ( joan plowright )  .  this foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming ,  dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it ,  but this is fine ;  it's the movie it wants to be .  alfred molina and jim broadbent  ( then relatively new to american audiences )  fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters ,  and all in all ,  mike newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements ,  full of quiet moments and wonder . 
alain delon visits swift ,  sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit-man in the duccio tessari thriller  " big guns "  after they accidentally murder his wife and child .  tessari and scenarists roberto gandus ,  ugo liberatore of  " a minute to pray ,  a second to die ,  "  and franco verucci of  " ring of death "  take this actioneer about a career gunman for the mob right down to the wire .  indeed ,   " big guns "  is rather predictable ,  but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings .  alain delon of  " the godson "  is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him retire so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter .  richard conte of  " the godfather "  plays a sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the hatchet with the delon character ,  but the rest of his hard-nosed associates want the hit-man dead .  like most crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s ,   " big guns "  subscribes to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay .  interestingly ,  the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice .  tessari does not waste a second in this 90-minute shoot'em up .  apart from the mother and son dying in a car bomb meant for the father ,  the worst thing that takes place occurs in an automobile salvage yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a junked car .  ostensibly ,   " big guns "  is a rather bloodless outing ,  but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama .  only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact .  tessari stages a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets .  the photography and the compositions are excellent . 
what the  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  is this  ?  this must ,  without a doubt ,  be the biggest waste of film ,  settings and camera ever .  i know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high ,  but this is too stupid to be true .  i baught this film for 0 . 89$ and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back .  can you imagine who hard it stinks  ?   who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations ?  ?  ?  well actually ,  you couldn't possible care less .  and why should you ?  the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care .  they didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension .  the director  (  stephen carpenter -- i guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that  )  also made the kindred  ( 1986 )  wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors .  complete crap as well ,  but at least that one had eliza dushku .  this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga  !  !  !   (  who  ?  ?   )  yeah that's right ,  the melrose place chick .  her very memorable character dies about 15 min .  after the opening credits .  she's the second person to die .  the first victim dies directly in the first minute ,  but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares  ?  the rest of the actors .  .  . they don't deserve the term actors actually ,  are completely uninteresting .  you're hoping they die a quick and painful death .  .  . and not only their characters  my humble opinion = 0 / 10
did the movie-makers even preview this before they released it ?  the script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation .  the beginning doesn't clarify if its a prequel or not .  it starts with superman's beginnings on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - but doesn't really alert the viewer of this .  very confusing !  superman himself is weak and in need of prozac .  he is portrayed as a potential home-wrecker ,  a stalker ,  and someone who is clearly depressed and confused .  this type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero .  the ending is absolutely ridiculous .  superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself .  i'm seriously waiting for a snl skit where superman appears on maury povich and maury says ,   " the results are in - in the case of the child ,  superman ,  you are the father .  "  to sum up - ok acting by this superman and kevin spacey ,  but horrible script .  the movie is basically unwatchable . 
double exposure was a tremendous surprise .  it contains outstanding acting  ( particularly from the underrated callan )  ,  fine cinematography and a compelling storyline .  in other words ,  it's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s .   callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models ,  at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother  ( who happens to be missing an arm and a leg )  .  when the models callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead ,  the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity .  .  .  but there is more to the picture than he is seeing .   this film never received the praise it deserves .  most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time ,  but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot .  it's clever and unique ,  which isn't something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre ,  but it's also passionately crafted and performed .  double exposure is a gem of its kind . 
this version of anna christie is in german .  greta garbo again plays anna christie ,  but all of the other characters have different actors from the english version .  both were filmed back to back because garbo had such a following in germany .  garbo herself supposedly favored her anna christie in this version over the english version .  it's a good tale and a must-see for garbo fans . 
there is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of the indian runner .  unzip your trousers .  peek inside .  is there evidence of a y chromosome ?  okay ,  you'll do .   this film has all the male requisites :  blood ,  guns ,  car chases ,  fond women ,  death ,  multiple tattoos ,  cigarettes ,  liquor ,  violence ,  pyrotechnics -- what have i left out ?  -- oh ,  yeah ,  blowtorches .   as a woman ,  i seriously hope sean penn regards this as a `when i was a child .  .  . ' kind of effort .  since he both wrote and directed the thing ,  he's nearly solely responsible .  an uneven cast  ( viggo mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job's supposed to be done )  tries to save penn .  too late .  the lines and action are there .  even devoted ,  skilled acting can't change those .   i found this movie puerile and silly ,  as well as predictable .  the dialogue staggers along -- sandy dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity .  then she dies .  after a bit ,  so does the protagonists' father ,  played by charles bronson .  their absence is hardly noticeable .   at intervals ,  the pyrotechnics ,  etc .  ,  noted above appear to liven things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring .   if you're male and under 25 ,  you may adore this film .  plan to return to it at 35 .  think you'll still like it ?   i don't think so . 
first off ,  i'm not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good ,  in fact i'm not even a huge justin fan ,  but i did like this movie .   i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about .  i didn't find justin's acting that bad ,  it was clearly the worst out of the group ,  but it's a pretty impressive group ,  with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list .  the story is basic ,  a journalist uncovering corrupt cops ,  but i found it well done .  l l cool j's character was clearly conflicted ,  but i honestly didn't know what he would do in the end .  morgan freeman is as always ,  the wise mentor figure he does so well ,  and as much as i love kevin spacey ,  he was kind of just there .  his character didn't have a whole lot of substance ,  but it's kevin spacey ,  he can do no wrong .   surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop .  truly believable and really in character ,  he freaked me out a couple of times .   i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest .  horrible catchphrases ,  unjustified action sequences ,  stuff like that ,  but it was surprisingly well done and i didn't find any of that .  every shooting had a point ,  it wasn't clichéd ,  pretty solid really .   overall ,  amazing cast ,  decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump .  i don't know why it didn't appear in theatres ,  it was better than some garbage i've seen on the big screen .  i would say it's worth seeing . 
the film had some likable aspects .  perhaps too many for my taste .  it felt as though the writer/director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters .  not once ,  a few times .  .  . but all of the time .    this is the job of television ,  not cinema .    the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler's performance as the pregnant friend .    i felt as though justine clarke's performance was wan .  her reactions to things felt forced ,  as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions .  i also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence .    i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences .  this is a lazy device ,  especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest .    that said ,  there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality .  it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine .  especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity ,  infusing it with passion and hand-crafted charm .    i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked .   " who knows if there's a god ?  like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do "  or whatever the line was .    perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife  " i'm giving up smoking .  "    an anti-smoking commercial ?  a tac ad with some tasteful animation ?  i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much . 
if you only read a synopsis of the plot ,  this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930's .  the story would seem quite contrived ,  the subject matter maudlin .  the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct ,  earthy performances of the cast . i have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling ,  rich and subtle nuances float over her face .  if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel ,  there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters .  the raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed ,  so true .  the final sequence is almost unbearably poignant :  when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son ,  lifts him up and proudly says ,   " my kid !  "  ,  i couldn't help remember that mr .  gable's own son was born to him posthumously .  this is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema . 
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way .  i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise .  it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution .  not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end ,  when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father .  the majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else .  there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to .  a class a film with fine acting and directing .  this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists .  it is a film about people and their lives ,  their mistakes ,  and their triumphs .  a good film worth watching several times annually . 
i was not expecting much from this movie .  i was given a ticket for an advanced screening .  i had just gotten off of work .  it was hot and i was tired .  i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex .   once seated in the theater ,  tired and frustrated ,  the movie started ,  i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning ,  but the flow of the movie was perfect .  right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie ,  getting more and more excited with each minute passing .  i think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic .  the actors were fabulous ,  the pace was perfect ,  and the ending was magical . 
china o'brien  ( 1990 )  was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states .  this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse .  sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director .  the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms .  rothrock and richard norton .  if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight-to-video action flick .   china o'brien returns home to help out her dad .  he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help .  so she returns home and restores order  ( with the help of two unlikely people )  .  but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies ?   if you're a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you .  i only enjoyed the fighting scenes ,  everything else is rubbish .  why didn't raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director ?   recommended . 
alone in the dark is uwe boll's kick in the nuts to hollywood after house of the dead's punch in the face .   if anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator boll is .  after forcing artisan out of business over the flop that was house of the dead ,  one can only assume the normally credible lion's gate films only released aitd under contractual obligation after acquiring artisan's assets .  because aitd is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability ,  plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework .   but then that's the point ,  isn't it .  boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct alone in the dark .  he's just trying to manipulate hollywood .   alone in the dark ,  like house of the dead ,  dungeon siege ,  far cry ,  bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are  " announced "  or in  " pre-production "  .   these aren't movies to be directed ,  but investment portfolios .  every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years .  the more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame ,  the more money he and his investors can gain .  why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway ?  the result is movies like the awfulness of alone in the dark .   alone in the dark ,  like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of hollywood's current trend for lazy film-making .   and to those who support boll by calling him misunderstood or the next ed wood ,  congratulations ,  by making a cult figure out of the man ,  you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety .   for more information ,  read here :  http : //www . cinemablend . com/feature . php ? id=209 http : //www . cinemablend . com/forum/showthread . php ? s=&threadid=21699 as an aside ,  just don't ask me how he's getting his cast-lists together .  unless the actors are in on the investment-scam somehow ,  that mystery has still to be uncovered . 
i consider this movie a masterpiece ,  but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it ,  so as to realize what a great movie it was .  first ,  it describes a face of ww2 that we don't usually see in hollywood movies .  in particular ,  german soldiers ,  army and the nazi government are shown more  " humanized "  .  one of the facts that impressed me most was the mention ,  by the end of the movie ,  of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's .  .  .  that forest is the place where the final chapters of berlin alexanderplatz take place :  those are the woods where reinhold kills mieze .  another clue for those who like the details ,  is the representation of doors .  fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door ,  or a door is opened .  many doors are shown in the screen ,  opened and closed .  and the characters change in their personality ,  their acts ,  etc any time that happens .  have you noticed that ? 
still love it 17 or so years after the first time i saw it ,  in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset .  despite it's non-association with the original  ( which as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i don't care about )  ,  this is what cartoons *should* be like .  just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone .  i'm more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing .  the music is great ,  and gets stuck in your head forever .  .  . i have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another . 
today ,  bea arthur died so i was cruising around the imdb web site and somehow wound up on a show called  " gloria .  "   " all in the family "  was a brilliant show for its first four or five years and i bet i watched every episode more than once .  however ,  i swear that i did not know a show named  " gloria "  existed .  maybe ,  that's a good thing .  maybe ,  it means i had a life as a young adult rather than watching television .   on the other hand ,  it is pathetic that the  " all in the family "  franchise had deteriorated so much that it begat a show i never heard of -- and one that is rated very poorly by the previous reviewers .   i rated the show a 1 for two reasons -- the system did not allow me to register a no vote and writers and tv execs should be condemned for starting a show that had no business being on the air and besmirches the memory of one of the greatest shows in tv history .   shalom ,  zwrite
 " the mother "  tells of a recently widowed mid-60's mother of two adult children  ( reid )  who ,  on the heels of her husband's death ,  finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover .  the film dwells on the quietly passive mom ,  her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter ,  the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover ,  and the convolutions arising therefrom .  a somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents ,   " the mother "  does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism .  will play best with more mature audiences ,  possibly women ,  who may better empathize with the central character ,  her needs and issues .   ( b+ ) 
if you like mech war games it's pretty good .  some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing .  i've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs .  if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and $350 to spare steel battalion .  the movie is worth seeing at least once .  there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there .  less remakes and more original works .    enjoy
 .  .  . but i expected better from caroline munro .  she's done some good films ,  and i was hoping this would be just as good .  as a matter of fact ,  she and this other blonde girl character  ( the girl who got electrocuted i think )  were the only two out of the 8-11 actors who could act .  this film has the worst acting i've ever seen .  almost as bad as 'psycho'  ( 1998 )  .  the really dumb part was when the woman was in the shower and marty rigged it to pour battery acid in there .  she starts screaming ,  and her scream is probably the most annoying sound in the whole world .  she attempts to get out ,  but  " accidentally "  falls back in .  i will admit ,  the violence and story is good ,  along with harry manfredini's music ,  but the acting could've been a lot better .  there were two other characters ,  frank and joe .  i don't know about you ,  but they bare a strange resemblance to dan akyroyd .  also ,  when they find that woman's fried corpse in the bathtub ,  you would think they'd be screaming and barfing .  no .  caroline munro and the blonde woman are the only ones who react .  frank and joe barely show any signs of fear or disgust .  i don't know about you ,  but i know that if i saw a fried skeleton of one of my best friends ,  i'd puke .  also ,  when joe starts saying stuff like  " what happened to marty was an accident ,  it wasn't our fault .  "  he says it like his nervous or scared but barely shows any facial expressions .  then the blonde girl starts crying and says  " i'm scared frank !  "  .  and she grabs joe .  i guess the actress really didn't know which guy was which .  the film's ending is the most confusing thing i ever saw .  more confusing than the climax of  " jaws :  the revenge "  .  all the eight friends end up dead ,  marty kills them all ,  but then ,  you see something that looks like him being chased by their rotted corpses ,  and then it just cuts to marty still in the hospital from the accident ,  and then when the film ends ,  marty dresses up as a nurse trying to sedate him ,  but then we see that marty has gotten into her clothes or somethin like that kills a doctor ,  and the film ends with marty peeling skin off his face .  which leads me to this next question .  what was the writer on when he came up with that ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  did he actually expect people to understand just what the hell happened ?  ?  the ending left me so confused .  were the characters still alive ?  is marty still holding a grudge ?  did the events we just see not happen yet or not at all ?  i don't know .  overall ,  this movie was pretty dumb .  the acting sucked ,  the music was okay ,  the story was pretty decent  ( except for the ending )  .  basically ,  this is just one of your average 80s teen slasher flicks .  see it only for harry manfredini and caroline munro .  2/10  p . s .  - simon scuddamore  ( marty )  committed suicide shortly after the film's release from intentional drug abuse .  i guess he was the only person who knew this film was what it really was .  a pile of sh**
i'd been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much .  i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn't work for me .   the problem lies in the fact that the film doesn't really seem to understand which genre it's falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama ,  horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it's a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none .   the premise  ( as with most revenge films )  is simple ,  couple meet and go out ,  something bad happens and they get their revenge it's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years .  unfotunately in this case it's as if dan reed thought ,   " it'd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail .  .  .  .  "  wrong !  there are also a few key elements missing ,  in this type of movie there's generally some kind of warning .  a don't do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there's nothing of the sort here .  it just simply happens ,  then nothing happens for an hour ,  then something interesting happens and then it ends .   there's a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying ,  i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing .  .  .  i'd say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he's making instead of trying to be too clever and he'll have a quality movie on his hands . 
i am 13 and i hated this film its the worst film on earth i totally wasted my time watching it and was disappointed with it cause on the cover and on the back the film it looks pretty good ,  but i was wrong its bad .  but when i saw delta she was totally different and a bad actress and i really didn't know how old the 2 girls was trying to be i was so confused .  the film was in some parts confusing and i didn't enjoy it at all but i watched all the film just to see if it was going to get better but it didn't ,  it was boring , dull and did i say boring . and i don't think many other people liked it as well as me . boring boring boring
this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting .  mr .  torn and ms farrel do an outstanding job .  i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it .  wonderful performances .   it gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally .  great unheard of movie .   it was done when ms .  farrel was very young .  i had always thought of her as a comedian ,  but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful .  there is very little dialogs ,  but that just make it seem more real .  mr .  torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling .  i must see movie . 
having seen cube ,  i've been a fan of vincenzo natali's work .  natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline ,  and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster .  instead ,  he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways ,  so much in fact ,  that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape ,  or in the case of nothing ,  a large empty expanse where there is .  .  .  nothing !  the advert had me hooked instantly .  it seemed so simple !  take two characters who no one likes ,  and send them to a world where there is nothing .  natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist .  in fact ,  the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film .  there's nothing there ,  but also 'something' there .   it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading .  i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so .  therefore upon watching the film ,  i laughed every now and again ,  whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused .   if i may take a minute to give the film some praise ,  where the film excels on is the concept .  it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing ,  and to put two characters there ,  not two brilliant minded characters ,  who will philosophise and work out their surroundings ,  but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are !  another strong point is the film's cinematography ,  though at first this may not seem it !  where each wall ,  north ,  earth ,  south ,  west ,  up and down is just a white plane ,  a perception of depth becomes faulty .  it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis-en-scene .  the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens ,  but for the most part ,  the camera is placed so that two characters ,  or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background ,  allowing a sense of depth to be realised .   however ,  this film does lack in certain areas .  the film is relatively short ,  but even so ,  after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull ,  and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot .  we can also argue that the acting is once again ,  questionable .  these two characters are in a sense ,  unlikeable ,  therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters .  however ,  on a flip side of that ,  the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough ,  but there is something lacking .   even so ,  i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film !  do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science-fiction horror film .  it is much more of a comedy than that !  it is indeed worth watching though ,  purely for the concept itself ! 
by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing .  you know the type .  .  .  . funny but supposed to frighten you .  .  .  .  this was not funny or horrific .  the writing was lame .  .  . the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness .  .  .  . they were so expected .  the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good script .  .  . at least i hope that wasn't their best .  . watch this movie at your own risk .  .  .  .  .  . i give it negative 3 stars outta 10
this is a great movie .  i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink ,  and the skeletons chase him ,  but luckily he dodged them ,  opened the window ,  and didn't even notice them .  xiao qian is very pretty too .  & when he stuck the needle up ma wu's butt ,  its hysterical .  and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too .  then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people .  then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves .  the love scenes are romantic ,  xiao qian and ning look cute together .  add the comic timing ,  the giant tongue ,  and u have horror ,  romance ,  comedy ,  all at once .  not to mention superb special effects for the 90s . 
if you have seen friends ,  the writing will feel very familiar .  especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy setups .   the show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young  ( about 10 years old i think )  .  now ,  they're in their mid-twenties ,  and they meet again on a class reunion .  this is where the series starts .   a typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once .  they're usually not connected in any way .  each story line is cut up into multiple sections ,  which are then shown in a mixed order .   the sketches is where my problems lie with this series .  as in the later seasons of friends ,  it's often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations .  one of the main characters does something really stupid that's hard to believe .  the situation is then heavily exaggerated ,  as if it wasn't silly enough .  if you're into this kind of in-your-face humor ,  then maybe you'll like this series .  for me it is a great turn-off .   the reason i started watching friends is because of the first few seasons .  there are interesting and especially credible story lines ,  with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters .  the class has none of this .  the characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far .  it's therefore not possible to relate to them and like them .   at least with friends ,  it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out .  but in the class ,  it seems it has run out of steam before it even started . 
i feel blessed to own what is known as the worst steven seagal movie ever made .  i knew i was on to something special when steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out .  by the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and i was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter .   steven is steven  ( with an ever changing voice )  and totally unbelievable in his role  ( as always )  .  who the hell lets people with bad nappy-hair pony tail mullets into the forces anyway ?  he also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior .  the supporting actors all look like they've been shot in the dark - btw ,  did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting ?    this is truly abominable in every way possible .  invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this one's truly special . 
recap :  ron is about to marry mel .  they are deeply and love and certain they are perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago .  todd ,  ron's brother in law to be is not so happy .  he is afraid the marriage is a threat to his cushy job in the family business and decides to arrange ron's bachelor party .  but his real plan is to put ron in a compromising situation ,  get evidence and break ron and mel up .   comments :  supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic but it isn't funny at all .  it is mostly a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse to show scantily clad women .  actually ,  in a way ,  it is almost impressive have many you can put in there ,  because they are everywhere .  unfortunately that is also one of the signs of a movie that can't support itself .  it simply isn't good enough .   it has three redeeming points though ,  or actually three actors that is worth a better script than this .  it is lead actor josh cooke who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense .  sara foster i know has more talent than to do movies like this ,  and emanuelle vaugier seem to have a lot more talent than this movie .   what is suspiciously absent are good jokes .  actually ,  bad jokes are rather scarce too .  it just isn't funny .   3/10
imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night ,  and then going to bed .  there's no need to lock the doors .  the only sound is the wind whistling through the trees .  sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway .  moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room .   what makes this image so scary is the setting :  a remote farmhouse  .  .  .  at night .  based on truman capote's best-selling book ,  and with b&w lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films ,   " in cold blood "  presents a terrifying story ,  especially in that first act ,  as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads .  it's the stuff of nightmares .  but this is no dream .  the events really happened ,  in 1959 .   two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire kansas family ,  looking for a stash of cash that doesn't exist .  director richard brooks used the actual locations where the real-life events occurred ,  even the farmhouse  .  .  .  and its interior !  it makes for a memorable ,  and haunting ,  film .   both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real-life killers .  robert blake is more than convincing as perry smith ,  short and stocky with a bum leg ,  who dreams of finding cortez' buried treasure .  scott wilson is almost as good as dick hickock ,  the smooth-talking con artist with an all-american smile .   after their killing spree ,  the duo head to mexico .  things go awry there ,  so they come back to the u . s .  ,  stealing cars ,  hitchhiking ,  and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place .  but it's a fool's life ,  and the two outlaws soon regret their actions .  the film's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing ,  as the rain falls ,  the rope tightens ,  and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart .   even with its somewhat mundane middle act ,   " in cold blood "  stages in riveting detail a real-life story that still hypnotizes ,  nearly half a century later .  it's that setting that does it .  do you suppose people in rural kansas still leave their doors unlocked  .  .  .  at night ? 
i just got through watching this dvd at home .  we love westerns ,  so my husband rented it .  he started apologizing to me half way through .  the saddles ,  costumes ,  accents--everything was off .  the part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the  " collector "  with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul .  his only excuse was  " he only had 2 arrows left .  "  we watched it all the way through ,  and ,  as someone else said .  .  . too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked .  i mean ,  the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found ,  what's the point of that ?  and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around ?  if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers ,  this may be your movie .  however ,  if you want a real western ,  you will hate this movie . 
i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time ,  so i was anticipating it greatly when it arrived .  my worst fears were that it would be plodding ,  as well as .  .  .  well ,  you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about ?  gacktnhyde=hawt yaoi love ?  that sort of thing ?  dreading it .  i was very ,  very pleasantly surprised .  the movie was surprisingly watchable ,  even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes ,  and the acting on gackt's part was quite good .  hyde ,  being ,  um ,  hyde ,  acted as a quasi-romantic friend/gang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by .  he's one of my two major beefs with the film itself .  but the rest of the cast  ( including the child actors in the opening scene )  were very good at doing what they did- which was ,  mostly ,  get shot at and yelled at .  but my second problem was very minor ,  having to do with the goriness .  it seemed way too suspense-horror to me- like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over ,  really most sincerely dead ,  or lay there burbling for a rather long time .  but sho just .  .  .  takes the shots ,  repeatedly ,  keels over ,  bubbles a lot while he talks ,  and makes hyde cry .  all in all ,  if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-film fan ,  it's definitely worth a watch . 
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  while featuring good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations .  the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music ,  which pretty much sums up the movie :  compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors ,  loud and dramatic music .  it doesn't change the fact ,  that this is a very boring movie to watch .  earned itself a score of 1 . 
well its official .  they have just killed american pie .  the first 3 were absolutely hysterical ,  but this one and the others have been awful .  i mean the story is about two college fraternity's who battle each other for its houses ,  i mean come on talk about a weak plot ,  the first three dealt with growing up ,  change and marriage ,  which are all worthy points of development in human society .   the new stifler is the biggest joke ,  i know its hard trying to compare yourself with the steven stifler but so no cigar .  i give this movie a 3 because there is 2-3 funny bits in the film .   the best character in this movie of course is jim's dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films . 
he pulled the guys guts out his butt !  that's a spoof right ?  !  no one really writes that it just happens like improv gone horribly wrong .  i think any way .  this movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise .  can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the storyboard .   director says ,   " next our inbreed villain uses his 24 inch machete to disembowel our token creepy neighbor .  get this ,  he is going to pull the guts out his bunghole "    " brilliant !  "  the entire cast proclaims .   no way can that happen ,  nobody writes that stupid !  gotta be a spoof .   i loved the part where the skinny introspective gal beats the inbreed freak to death with the cast iron skillet she finds on the floor of the cave .  i wasn't sure the inbreed cannibal types bothered to cook much .  maybe that explains why the skillet was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk .  seems ironic that after the freaky guy had bested martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type jocks he falls so easily to the frying pan of a skinny defenseless girl next door .    what the heck is that richard greco guy doing in this ?  did he fire his agent or something ?    can anyone explain the ending to me please because i didn't get it either ?  i can't quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea .  never mind i don't want to know . 
you can call this one a flop ,  and that's a very big one too !  quality isn't associated with the words national lampoon ,  but at least the vacation and animal house entries were fun ,  but this offering has got to be their most inane feature to date that i've watched .  ugh !  the three piece story crazily attempts to parody the clichés and stereotypes that flooded hollywood genre films ,  which turns out to be completely unfunny and boorish dross .    " growing yourself .  "  - jason a corporate lawyer decides to quit his job and split up with his wife so they both can grow and do what they always wanted to do .  that's life ,  as jason sees it and he takes over looking after the children ,  but his decision to follow this path might not be the right one .   talk about leaden ,  boring and stiff .  there only real interest is the small performance of the lovely diane lane .  the satirical element here seems to be pointing out something than actually just delivering it .  the silly humour is strained ,  flat and particularly senseless .  peter riegert's keeps it very deadpan in the lead role and teresa ganzel bubbles along in her role .    " success wanters "  - after just finishing collage dominique corsair gets a job as a stripper and is rape with some butter by the dairy company presidents .  for payback she becomes interested in the margarine industry and virtually works her way to the 'very "  top .   probably the best one of the three ,  but the competition wasn't too great .  the gags seem to want go more subtle with its sexual and power orientated tone ,  but still they do feel more tacky and forced .  the idea had something promising and inventive to build on ,  but the languid pacing begins to wear thin by the end and disastrous dialogue don't do it any favours at all .  the humour tries ,  but more often doesn't come off ,  despite the hunger .  the seductively ann dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative throughout  ( well after the painful ordeal )  and likes to gracefully bare it all quite a bit .  even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full workout for the opening half of the story .  popping up in amusing minor cameos ranged from dick millar ,  mary woronov ,  olympia dukakis ,  fred willard ,  robert culp and a favourite turn by joe spinell .    " municipalians "  - a serial killer who leaves copies of his driver's licence behind after each murder ,  is being tracked down by an enthusiastically naive rookie cop and his old grizzled partner .  however the young cop learns that being tough is the only way to go ,  when the pair encounter one situation after another .   stupid !  oh yeah .  sure if you're going to spoof something extremely over-the-top ,  make sure laughter will stream off it .  obviously they forgot that !  even at its 30 minutes running ,  boy does it drag !  robby benson's gratingly mock performance got rather overbearing with a wearied richard widmark doing very little as his partner .  christopher lloyd underplays the role of serial killer ,  but his creepily wry and sympathetic performance works well and pretty much shows up the other leads .  elisha cook jr .  ,  rhea perlman and harry reems appear .  when the jokes come ,  they truly feel out of sync and get rather stale with its repetitiveness of making fun of these cop clichés .   in all ,  the idiotic material laced with its skits comes across as disposable ,  and the unbearable script is basically inept and witless .  only one or two few gags make it out each segment ,  but really there's too many cheap stinkers or plain misses which stick in your head .  this is because it virtually becomes what it's trying to poke fun at and this basically shows in each story .  it loses sight .  the performances range from hot to cold ,  but who can't deny the embarrassment that's felt on most of their faces .  director bob giraldi's first taste is a vapid one for  " growing yourself "   ,  but  " success wanters "  showed some minor flourishes of mild effectiveness .  henry jaglom does a labouredly jaded job on  " municipalians "   .  rick meyerowitz's vividly crass drawings that opens the film ,  are neatly devised and go on to set the style and mood .   this low-brow comedy flunks it by overplaying it ,  with the main interested being derived by the familiar cameos .  but really ,  is it worth going through this putridly lame and restless get-up ,  just to spot them .  well ,  that's up to you . 
this film is more about how children make sense of the world around them ,  and how they  ( and we )  use myth to make sense of it all .  i think it's been misperceived ,  everyone going in expecting a stalkfest won't enjoy it but if you want a deeper story ,  it's here .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
ice-t stars as mason a homeless african-american who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters  ( rutger hauer , gary busey , charles s .  dutton ,  f . murray abraham , william mcnamara and john c .  mcginley )  however mason proves to be much harder prey then the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow paced actioner which takes too long setting up actionscenes and then totally botching them . 
this is unlike any other movie ,  the closest thing i can compare it to is a woody allen film .  .  .  but where as woody allen is constantly fathoming human foibles bret carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse .  in the case of lou ,  it is the root cause of his stuttering ,  which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs .   there are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and i believe they all deserve a chance for redemption ,  although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place ,  so maybe we shouldn't fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or breasts .   this is an indie film shot on a long shoestring ,  but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film .  i feel like its a quirky gem for the self-help market .  i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next ,  i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks ,  although usually when a guy like this breaks through ,  he goes off and makes  "  x men "  and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they .  .  .  .  x men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly  :  ) 
after watching awake , i led to a conclusion : director and screenwriter joby harold made awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator , for the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements . awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements ( for example , the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses .  .  . did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor  ?  )  . the concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious but all the plot holes and the absurd things make of this a stupid and crappy film . with the exception of the great lena olin , all the actors bring bad performances . hayden christensen has zero expressions and the same applies for jessica alba . the extraordinary actor terrence howard is enormously wasted on his role . awake makes a laugh of the spectator . it's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously . my recommendation is : skip this crappy movie . 
a propaganda film for the palestinian  " cause "  .  if you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the israeli-palestinian conflict ,  you will need to look elsewhere .  if you are an anti-semite  ( or merely an anti-zionist---nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country ,  right ?  )  or uncritically in support of palestinian goals  ( e . g .  ,  mass murder ,  the destruction of israel )  ,  this is the documentary for you .  should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the uk and us .  however ,  any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video .  i just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti-semitic filth . 
i went and saw rivers and tides again today .  it's the second time in two days and yes ,  i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary .  yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthy's works .  this morning when i threw the coins i received #29 the abysmal  ( water )  .  goldsworthy has an affinity with water ,  hence the title .  i received the 5th line changing which moved to #7 the army .  to blake art was a war .  anyway ,  i knew i had to see the film again .   i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner .  the critic loved the film but said goldsworthy's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film .  he'd rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack .  so i was aware of that as i watched this second time .   yesterday i thought that i'd vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world .  well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say .  could i enjoy the film without his comments ?  what he is doing ,  what he is saying goes way beyond  " art "  .  his understanding of water ,  time ,  stone ,  change ,  and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar .  some of his work/words are zen like .  his knowledge .  .  .   anyway ,  the film is only  ( apparently )  being shown here in the bay area .  be a trend setter .  go to your local cinema and tell them ,  no insist that they have to book a film you've heard about from the hinter lands .  it's called rivers and tides .   
i've now seen this film twice ,  and i must say i enjoyed it both times .  it's fast paced and fun ,  but ultimately daft .  having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original .  it is clear for those who have seen the awful 'zombie creeping flesh' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to bruno mattei ,  and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to fulci .  this is not idle fulci sycophancy ,  the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout ,  and you can tell who directed what ,  particularly in mattei's case .   the film is centered around the outbreak of a virus  ( oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist ,  it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind )  somewhere in south east asia .  the virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected ,  and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land .  our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone ,  and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected asians .   the film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick ,  and an out and out action adventure ,  and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves .  they do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all .  some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety ,  so well rendered in the original ,  and probably fulci's creation here .  the other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves ,  but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu :  indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims .  martial arts skills aren't their only talents either ,  they are well versed in guerilla tactics ,  hiding on rafters and under bales of hay ,  and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves .  this is all definitely the work of mattei .   there is a third ,  more chatty ,  variety of zombie .  this type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'i'm really thirsty .  .  . for your blood' .  the ridiculous twist at the end in which the dj turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind ,  only serves to enhance the wtf factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution .   then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air ,  a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face ,  as if to say 'yeah we know how bad this looks' .   the characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect .  but its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously .  having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace .  indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro ,  and one of the only effective scenes in the film .   the guy who played the chief scientist has heart ,  but no talent ,  utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random ,  so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic .  the scientists' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing 'now lets put these two molecules together ! '   there are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however .  in an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage .  upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor ,  all shot in an atmospheric diffused light .  the silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her .  his sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film .  the before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak ,  and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance .  there is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead ,  and this is quite tense .  things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs .  but this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been .   all in all i would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest ,  rather than simply a through and through bad film .  if nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that i've come to expect from just about anything italian and gory from the eighties . 
'intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery .  i'm a middle-aged married father of two .  i'm quite functional in my personal and professional life .  still ,  i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe ,  and issues from which i am slowly recovering .  when these addicts and their families share their lives with me ,  they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family .   the show ,  unlike many others ,  digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction .  many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do ,  as alice miller says ,   " the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood .  "  the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started .  this digging is painful and difficult ,  but worth it .  so much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues .  often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self-interest ,  and now they can't stop .  not so :  addictions are about killing pain .  i can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives .  there are common themes ,  and surprising exceptions .  many addicts have suffered miserable abuse .  some kids simply respond badly to divorce .  to those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship ,  i would just say that different people respond differently .  although some kids handle divorce well ,  others ,  like cristy in the show ,   " collapse in a heap on the floor "  and have their lives forever changed by the event .   for example ,  last night's counselor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men .  she strips for cash for a 75-year old neighbor and lets men abuse her .  sound familiar to anyone ?  the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives .  often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest .  as they say ,  even a stopped watch is right twice a day ,  but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while ,  until it's made your life miserable .   to the producers :  thank you for making the show ,  for digging into the past ,  for the follow-ups .  also ,  the graphics ,  the format ,  and the theme music are brilliant .   to the addicts :  thank you for your courage to share .  whether or not you have helped yourself ,  you have helped me . 
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie .  its got a pretty good plot ,  some good action ,  and the change of location for harry does not hurt either .  sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that .  eastwood is in good form as dirty harry ,  and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop .  if you liked dirty harry ,  then you should see this one ,  its a lot better than the dead pool .  4/5
uneducated & defiant ,  beautiful tess of the storm country is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on a rich man's land .  spirited & bold ,  she captures the heart of the millionaire's son ,  but violence ,  terror & sudden death are what will haunt her immediate future before she can claim the sweet peace of happiness .   mary pickford is utterly charming in this splendid ,  heart-wrenching film .  she considered tess to be her favorite role and she fills it with all the spunky joy & enthusiasm which made her for years the world's most popular movie star .  the story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale ,  with mary the lovely ,  distressed heroine beset by all manner of dangerous ,  stressful situations .  the atmospherics are first-rate ,  with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well-conceived .   in the supporting cast ,  jean hersholt stands out as the vile villain who tries forcing pickford to marry him .  hersholt ,  a very gentle soul off screen ,  manages brilliantly to depict his character's complete moral corruption .   this was actually the second time pickford filmed tess .  a 1914 version had been one of her first important films ,  but its production values were a bit antiquated by the standards of the 1920's  ( no close-ups ,  for instance )  and mary ,  producing her own films & powerful enough by 1922 to make whatever film she wanted ,  decided for the only time in her career to remake a film .  the end result certainly lived up to her expectations .  both films were very popular at the box office .   a fascinating study for some future film researcher would be the influence of christianity in mary pickford's life ;  it certainly runs like a golden thread through the silent movies she produced .  although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema might cause these spiritual sentiments to appear somewhat awkward today ,  we are compelled to accept them as sincere reflections ,  by their very repetition ,  of mary's heartfelt beliefs .  in tess ,  one beautiful scene in particular stands out in this regard :  pickford is teaching herself to read using a bible .  she indicates to lloyd hughes  ( who plays her sweetheart )  a word from near the back of the book that she does not understand .  he mimes it for her  ( the word is obviously `crucified' )  and ,  eyes turned heavenward as the full meaning of the sacrifice dawns upon her ,  mary's face becomes positively beatific .   a splendid new orchestral score for tess has been supplied by jeffrey mark silverman which perfectly underscores the beauty & pathos of this wonderful film . 
although i agree that it's a good but not great movie ,  for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned ,  i still enjoy it .  one reason is the music :  i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the candoli brothers -- conte and pete -- in a well-staged scene in the nightclub .  these guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day ,  and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet ,  one trumpet in each of stewart's ears .  the candolis really did play that well ,  too ,  though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them .  i don't know much about george duning ,  who gets the credit for the music  ( other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion )  ,  but the casting of the candoli brothers as jazz-playing warlocks was a real nice touch . 
action .  comedy .  suspense .  this movie has it all .   the plot goes that 4 would be professional thieves are invited to take part in a heist in a small town in montana .  every type of crime movie archetype character is here .  frank ,  the master mind .  carlos ,  the weapons expert .  max ,  the explosives expert .  nick ,  the safe cracker and ray ,  the car man .  unfortunately for frank ,  he is apprehended by 2 bumbling detectives  (  portrayed very well by ed o'niel and daniel roebuck  )  that have been chasing him from new jersey write after he sends out the letters to the other 4 .   our 4 characters meet up at the train station and from the beginning none of them like or trust one another .  added to the mix is the fact that frank is gone and they are not sure why they have called together .   now frank is being taken back to new jersey by the 2 detectives but soon escapes on foot and tries to make his way back to the guys who are having all sorts of problems of their own .   truly a great film loaded with laughs and great acting .  just an overall good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different
as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of  " hero ,  "  i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines ,  but better .  it also featured an actress i like :  ziyi zhang .  well ,  i was disappointed on both counts .  i bought the dvd of this film sight-unseen ,  and that was a mistake .  it was not better .   i realize these flying-through-the-air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief .  a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents ?  sorry ,  that's going a little far .  also ,  the major male character 'jin "   ( takeshi kaneshiro )  was so annoying with his dialog ,  stupid look on his face and stupid laugh ,  that he ruined the film ,  too .   despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes ,  this story - to me - just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning .  this film is no  " hero "  of mine ! 
another example of the unique talents of cary grant .  a performance worthy of oscar consideration ,  yet once again shunned by the academy .  mr .  grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city .  the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis  ( loosely )  for the more modern tom hanks vehicle ,   " the money pit "  .   if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex ,  this movie is a must see . 
 " a young woman unwittingly becomes part of a kidnapping plot involving the son of a movie producer she is babysitting .  the kidnappers happen to be former business partners of the son's father and are looking to exact some revenge on him .  our babysitter must bide her time and wait to see what will become of the son and herself ,  while the kidnappers begin to argue amongst themselves ,  placing the kidnap victims in great peril ,  "  according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis .   that acclaimed director rené clément could be responsible for this haphazard crime thriller is the real shocker .  despite beginning with the appearance of having been edited in a washing machine ,  the film develops a linear storyline .  once you've figured out what is going on ,  the engaging maria schneider  ( as michelle )  and endearing john whittington  ( as boots )  can get you through the film .  there are a couple of female nude scenes ,  which fit into the storyline well .   **** wanted :  babysitter  ( 10/15/75 )  rené clément ~ maria schneider ,  john whittington ,  vic morrow
by some happy coincidence the same year that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcock's haunting masterpiece  " vertigo "  ,  they also made this light comedy .  perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the hitchcock film  .  at any rate this a great companion piece to  " vertigo "  as it again explores a very un-likely but powerful romance .  in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of  " vertigo "  with it's happy ending .  here again novak undergoes a transformation ,  in vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she 'transforms' from witch to mortal .  stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her .  unlike vertigo the two come together in  " bell book and candle "   ,  a perfect antidote for the hitcock movie .  again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein .  the cast is terrific .  lemmon hilarious as novak's warlock brother and elsa lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt .  ernie kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course hermoine gingold playing novak's competitor are all great .  the scene with stewart drinking the potion is comedy at it's best .  anyone who has seen vertigo or even if you haven't should see this memorable light comedy . 
the ramones ,  whom i consider the founders of modern punk rock ,  lend their then-unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan  ( p . j .  soles )  who faces off against a merciless ,  joyless principal  ( mary woronov )  for the right to rock .   featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music ,  rrhs is fascinating in concept and execution .  it's chock full of riotous sight gags  ( like the mouse experiment )  ,  teenage spirit  ( probably my all-time favorite film opening )  ,  and bizarre ,  off-the-wall moments  ( the straitjacket scenes )  .  if you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level ,  look no further .  but if you're looking for a nice ,  dignified ,  dramatic epic ,  maybe you should look a wee bit further .    " hi everybody ,  i'm riff randell ,  and this is rock & roll high school !  " 
i rented this dvd having seen it while looking for something else .  when i saw the title on the jacket i couldn't believe my eyes .  i read yalom's book about a year ago and loved it ,  in fact admire yalom's work in general .   ( i am a clinical psychologist .  )  i have watched perhaps 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off .  i'm not sure if i can take much more .  at a superficial level ,  the faux accents ,  as others have commented ,  are simply distracting at best and irritating and vapid at worst .  the acting is dull when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious .  the portrayal of lou salome is simply flippant ,  and the brilliant freud comes off as little more than a schoolboy .  i see very little of the book's spirit conveyed thus far .  i had hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students .  instead ,  i will refer them to the book .  imagine that . 
disney ?  what happened ?  i really wish the movie had been set in the 60's  ; like the book was .  and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption .  .  .  .  .  i'm glad that ,  maybe ,  someone might be influenced to read the books .  .  .  .  .  but ,  the man with red eyes interchangeable as it ?  and what's up with the volcanic upheaval ?  where was that in the book ?  peter jackson !  save us !  !  !  !  a long time ago  ( 1978 )  i heard that there was european version of this film .  i sure wish i could id it .  i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption .  this movie needs to be x'd . 
this movie proves that you can't judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the dvd cover .  it also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it  ( or get it for someone at christmas )  .  the beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising .  well ,  until you meet the characters .  pumpkin jack  ( the old guy from down the street )  brings the college co-eds a book full of witch's spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house  ( where the movie takes place )  .  after that there is some drinking ,  fighting ,  and soft core porn .  then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour .   overall ,  hallow's end was predictable ,  unsuspensful ,  and reminiscent of a soft-core porn .  this movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do ,  as it is a good movie to make fun of .  and for first-time viewers ,  it is really fun making predictions of the order of people who die . 
intelligent ,  stylish ,  and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films !   when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger ,  the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer .   dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason .  de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense .  the finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish' . it's a truly edge of your seat shocker .  even more impressive though is de palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own .  dressed to kill is also a very erotic film ,  but mainly in a strangely beautiful way .  pino donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film .   the cast is another strong feature of this film .  michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist .  angie dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife .  nancy allen's performance as an involved street-walker is solid .  a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son .   many criticize de palma's films for having hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception .  but any similarities between hitchcocks works and de palmas can only be seen as a good quality ,  as calling this film a 'rip-off' would be degrading to a fine thriller .  dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans .   **** out of ****
based on the idea from gackt ,  moon child took place in a poverty-stricken country called mallepa .  in a futuristic timeline ,  the story followed the lives of the two main characters ,  kei  ( hyde )  and sho  ( gackt )  and their friends growing up together .   despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous ,  i strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship .  even amongst all the hardships between each character ,  in the end ,  each of them wanted to have someone on their side ,  to have friends .   unlike most vampire characters ,  kei portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live .  a vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy ,  sho who's not afraid of kei .  regardless of what some might've thought ,  i see kei as a fatherly figure to sho .  kei was there throughout the earlier life of sho ,  he took care of him ,  and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives .  on the other hand ,  sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man ,  he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn't all about fun and games ,  that death exists and able to take away his loved ones .   i love the part where lee hom ,  the actor who played son ,  first appeared on the screen .  the way they met up was quite cool indeed .  son also has a big part within this movie ,  the fact that he's from a different race ,  a taiwanese ,  made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie .  the way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie .   i believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie .  both hyde and gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters .  unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs ,  they've done great acting jobs !  moon child really made an impact for me ,  it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration ,  that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes .  the movie shows a lot of hope ,  despite all the bad things that happen in their lives ,  that there's always hope .  life can be cruel ,  that it seems hope doesn't exist anymore .  it also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other ,  even when son became the enemy ,  sho did have some sort of  " fun "  at their last battle .  every single one of them desired peace in the end ,  no matter how far apart they've become .  the ending scene showed it to us . 
my wife and i are semi amused by howie mandel's show .  .  i also like shatner - even when he's at his most pathetic .  .   but this is absolutely the worst show on television .   please cancel this show .  it sucks a** .   the only positive thing i can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no deal .  .  .   the questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure .  and watching shatner or the contestant say  " show me the money "  makes me want to vomit .  .   this one will not last . 
 " the fallen ones "  falls under the waste of life  ( wol )  category .  i am sad that i am now two hours older was not entertained .  my other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy .  i felt sorry for the actors  ( wagner )  .  i have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on tv without any loss of plot .  it reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all .  in my humble opinion ,  the 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want dna samples for evil reasons .  the heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges .  later after everything was screwed up by the evil people .  the heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong . 
this was a strange kind of film about a low-lifes in new york city and centering around a main character  ( the title name ,  played by brad pitt )  who thinks he''s a ricky nelson-type musician ,  except he has no real talent .    it's kind of fun to watch until a profane tough new york city-type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over .  that ruined the film for me .  it must have been catherine keener ,  who usually plays tough and garbage-mouthed women .    the hairdo on pitt - an exaggerated pompadour - was fun to look at .  i can picture johnny depp playing this role better .  one last note :  it odd to hear a film made in 1992  ( other than woody allen's )  with just mono sound . 
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting .  the writing was top-notch .  james arness is a great actor and he showed it here .  brian keith was too old to be davy crockett ,  and can anyone really play davy but fess parker ?   another great actor in this move was raul julia ,  who gave depth to santa anna ,  a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent times .   while some may think the movie was slow-paced ,  it captured the battle as it unfolded ,  lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror .   what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in .  in this day and age when nobody stands for anything ,  i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom ,  no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time . 
as a horror-movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre ,  especially those which are the products of my native cinema .  and i can say that that the  " power of fear "   ( or  " vedma "  as the russian title of it )  is one of the weakest film among them .  firstly ,  it can't scary even a little kid ,  it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror .  frankly speaking ,  it's bad in all points :  from the goofy plot  ( i don't know why the russian producers/director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern-day-america thriller .  i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer  it doesn't thrill a bit )  and to the terrible and cheesy actors' work .  all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn't even bother to play at all ,  only spoke their english lines without any expression .  and at the end i don't really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors ?  i think it was their wrong turn .  at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing .  the same i can say about so called  " small american town backgrounds "  which were shot in estonia and look like it .  the only positive moment i found in the  " power of fear "  is the visual effects .  they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film .  and the music is ok ,  at least it doesn't irritate me .  that's why i give it two stars .  overall ,  if you want to see good horror film  don't waste your time and money on this boring flick .  and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i'd advise you to find a copy of  " viy or the spirit of evil "  .  it's really the terrific movie based on the same novel as  " power of fear "  but much ,  much better . 
liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century .  he is a true actor .  he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles .  jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary .  mary is such a beautiful woman .  it's her love that makes rob roy the legend ,  but it's his passion that makes her love undying .  they need each other .  tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect ;  in one way or another ,  upon watching the movie ,  you will find cunningham disgusting .  the scotland scenery is beautiful .  the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well .  if you like history ,  romance ,  passion and love ,  you'll enjoy rob roy .  there is violence and blood ,  but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told ;  no gratuitous violence .  and you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a scottish accent .  one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized ;  they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes .  it's their skill as actors that attracts you ,  they don't rely on marquee names ,  popularity or sex symbol appeal .  this is something special . 
a journey of discovery ,  this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy ,  island town in british columbia .  languorous and dreamy ,  the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young ,  fresh-faced teacher ,  with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland .  slowly ,  their indolent state is awakened ,  the father  ( and principal of the local school )  looks for excitement ,  the mother for stability ,  the oldest daughter for love ,  and the youngest for power .  while not an incredible or ground-breaking piece of cinema ,  the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing .  unfortunately ,  i doubt anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible . 
dire .  just dire .  the script is contrived ,  the acting painful ,  and the story just drags along .  it is ,  without a doubt ,  a celebration of sally potter and little else .  this wouldn't be so bad ,  but she's the director ,  writer and star of the film ,  and so is just self-glorification .  i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters ,  and the ending came not a moment too soon .  it has two redeeming features .  first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely ,  particularly in paris ,  and look rather good in black and white .  secondly ,  whether you're a fan of tango or not ,  the music is by and large ,  excellent  ( except where sally starts singing )  .  watch this film at your own risk ,  or if you need an unintentional laugh .  i am sure it appeals to someone .  statistically ,  it has to . 
samuel fuller's pickup on south street is anomalous :  a  " red scare "  movie devoid of hysteria ,  in which the communist threat is nothing more than the mcguffin that ignites the plot .  pickpocket richard widmark relieves loose woman jean peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm ;  unbeknownst to either of them ,  it harbors secrets vital to the cold war .  peters ,  as it happens ,  was under surveillance by fbi agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her ,  cowardly comsymp richard kiley .  in trying to retrieve the precious film ,  both sides enlist the help of thelma ritter ,  a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears .   fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story ,  which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality .  from the subways to the waterfront ,  his midsummer manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent .  the love scenes between peters and widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender ,  and they're scored to  " again ,  "  a song introduced by ida lupino in road house ,  also starring widmark .  the pace slackens for ritter's beautifully written and played death scene -- among the most poignant vignettes in all noir ,  and a kind of mirage-oasis in a film parched of sentimentality .  this is writer/director fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle ;  his later explorations of american pathology  ( the crimson kimono ,  the naked kiss ,  underworld u . s . a .  )  never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as pickup on south street . 
lost is an extremely well made tv series about some people that are lost on an island .  there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is ,  one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo !  !  !  !  !  ! so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait .  suspense ,  action ,  romance ,  humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about .  so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better .  ( i have a review on that too that you could check it out .  )  i would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable ,  you never know what will happen next . 
steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 year old virgin ,  having only had supporting roles in such films as bewitched ,  bruce almighty ,  anchorman ,  and his work on the daily show ,  we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own .  you can tell that will ferrell influenced his  " comedic air "  but carell takes it to another level ,  everything he does is innocent ,  lovable ,  and hilarious .  i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our time .   the 40 year old virgin is two hours of non-stop laughs  ( or 4 hours if you see it twice like i did )  ,  a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie .  the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all .  the music fit the tone of the movie great ,  and you can tell the director knew what he was doing .   filled with sex jokes ,  some nudity ,  and a lot of language ,  this movie isn't for everyone but if you liked the wedding crashers ,  anchorman ,  or any movie along those lines ,  you will absolutely love the 40 year old virgin . 
i haven't been able to decide if this movie is so bad it's good ,  or ,  to quote enid coleslaw ,   " so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again .  "  no matter ,  it forced me look much the same way a pile of weird coloured vomit might ,  and it offers up a number of scenes that you won't forget even if you want to .  there's a sneering young ray liotta telling a pigtailed pia that her creative writing trophy looks like a penis .  a bit later ,  there's ray again ,  molesting pia ,  not with the appropriately shaped trophy but a garden hose .  there's a firm chinned pia telling her domineering mom that she wants to go to bed with ray's geezer father ,  walter .  there's the actress in the graveyard scene yowling the best line ever written by pia or anyone else :   " wwwwhhhyyyyyyy !  "  there's that garden hose again ,  as walter waves it pia's face and roars  " is this more to your liking !  ?  "  there's pia and her date so turned on by closeups of each other masticating salad that they start tearing each other's clothes off .  there's pia showering but forgetting to remove her dress .  perhaps best of all ,  there's pia's typewriter ,  but instead of keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most  ( afterwards ,  i was afraid to open my laptop )  .  and finally there's pia at  " the awards "  exposing hollywood for the cesspool it is ,  spitting out the second best line ever ,   " i guess i'm not the only one who has ever had to **** her way to the top .  "  i see i have already spent more time commenting on  " the lonely lady "  than i have on far better pictures ,  so i'll quit .  be forewarned ,  though ,  that once you start watching you probably won't be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have vanished forever . 
i'm not a john cleese completist  ( although i thought  " fawlty towers was brilliant )  ,  but i am a fan ,  and when i saw this sitting ,  neglected ,  on a shelf at my local blockbuster ,  i decided to give it a try .  what i got was a wonderful surprise ,  and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences i've ever had .  the writing is typical english  " goon show "  schtick .  in fact ,  as an audio skit ,  this wouldn't be out of place on a  " firesign theater "  album .  but the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates  " strange case "  into the kind of jaw-dropping performance that can create lifelong british comedy fanatics .    the brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed  " tics "  of character and timing ,  and the creators use both to good effect here .  cleese's portrayal of  " holmes "  seems to owe much to the arkin's and seller's  " inspector clouseau "  ;  however cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own .  but the unexpected treat here is arthur lowe ,  who plays  " watson "  as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film .  i'd never heard of lowe before this  ( his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater )  ,  but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as i'm concerned .   some people might not care for  " strange case .  .  .  "  ,  especially if british whimsy isn't their  " cuppa tea "  .  but i am extremely glad i got to see this before it vanished from sight . 
when the bourne identity arrived five years ago i have to confess that i didn't think much of it .  at the time i was eleven years old ,  so perhaps i was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario .  two years ago when the bourne supremacy arrived i thought it was a better movie than identity but still didn't think it was as good as i expected it to be judging by the trailers .  over the past two years i had been told numerous times that the bourne movies were amazing ,  many a time i had to bite my tongue and not say what i really thought about the movies .  until two months ago i couldn't have given a damn about the bourne ultimatum ,  i really had no intentions of watching it .  but then i decided to go back and re-watch the first two before i came to any abrupt decisions .  so i went out and bought both the original movies .  and what a surprise it was to me when i was gripped by them .  identity i found the superior of the two ,  but supremacy isn't far behind .  they're both slick ,  action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that i have watched numerous times since i bought them .  because of this i was first in line today to see the bourne ultimatum .  and boy did bourne ultimatum not disappoint !    matt damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the bourne movies ,  i'd seen him in the talented mr ripley ,  but i never thought much of him in general .  however ,  it appears he was born to play bourne  ( pardon the pun )  .  throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes ,  in this movie we see matt damon at his very best ,  even better than he was in the departed and i thought he was one of the best things in the departed .  you really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything .  matt damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable .  the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding .  joan allen was one of my favourite things in bourne supremacy ,  here she excels herself .  her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie .  julia stiles turns up again as nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character .  julia stiles is a very underrated actress and i think she deserves a lot more roles ,  well decent roles ,  than she gets .  david strathairn is a newcomer to this series as noah vosen ,  he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels .  he's definitely the nastiest character we've met ,  and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty .  strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie .  special mention must also go to albert finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time ,  i will not say anything about the character ,  that's best left as a surprise ,  but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie .   the bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences ,  this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences ,  good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies .  but running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline .  this storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie .  as i watched supremacy the night before i saw ultimatum it was nice because i could notice certain little parts .  that very final scene in supremacy ,  in new york ,  a lot more important that i ever imagined at the time .  won't spoil it for people but i recommend checking up on supremacy before you see ultimatum .  unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see ultimatum purely because of the action sequences .  this is the part where i should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline ,  but i'd be lying if i didn't say that my favourite parts of the bourne series as a whole are the car chases .  the mini car chase in identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time .  well the action in ultimatum has to be the best of the bourne series .  in fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in moscow .  so in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups ,  all very violent and shockingly brutal .  a bike chase that is absolutely amazing ,  many foot chases which are even more amazing ,  a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable ,  and oh so much more !  but the highlight for me has to be the scene in waterloo station ,  won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped .   so any flaws for the movie ?  in my eyes no ,  but if you are not a fan of the bourne series or have not seen the previous two then i wouldn't recommend ultimatum for you .  the movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top .  the bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007 .  as a james bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the bond movies ,  and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that .  while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series ,  it is definitely nearly its equal . 
this movie was such a blast !  it has that feel-good ,  yet totally in your face attitude that draws me to a movie .  it has a good message  ( party girl decides she needs a real job )  yet she doesn't completely lose all sense of fun .  i recommend this movie for anyone who needs some humor ,  but is also a thinker !   :  ) 
i am not a parent ,  neither am i a male .  but i was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains .   this is a movie teenagers should watch .  maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again .  i'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love ,  family and friendship .   it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing .  and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance .  he showed at an early age ,  that he is capable of heartfelt drama .  he should be offered more serious roles .  note hollywoodland .  .  .  his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006 .   this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages .  maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families ,  but i recommend it to the entire family .   i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times .  because it portrays the values that are important in life . 
this collection really sucks !   i rented it ,  thinking i´d really would enjoy some good fighting .  man this sucked !  quick flashy cuts ,  an extremely annoying speaker ,  and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened  ( i´m thinking especially of jet li´s fight in fists of legend and jackie chan´s fight from drunken master 2 )  .   and what´s the deal with those brawling streetfighters ?  !  what´s so  " cool "  about that ?  i´ve seen more interesting fights on martial law !   this a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people .   do not ever buy this film !  do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap !   instead ,  go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory ! 
i don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said .  honestly i have only myself to be angry with .  i should have know better when i saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap ,  but i loved war games so i indulged my whim .  i will live to regret that decision the rest of my life .  from the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game i knew i was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot .  the list of very ,  very ,  very bad plot lines ,  dialog ,  and acting is so long i would crash imdb if i tried to post it .  to those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me .  i am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung . 
excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances .  it's often cited as his best ,  and i can't really judge fully until i have seen his  " dawn patrol "  .  however ,  his work in  " they died with their boots on "  takes some beating .  i'm a big flynn fan  ( he's my favourite actor after james mason--it also helps that he's an aussie )  and i think he's just marvellous ,  a great screen presence and also a great actor .  he is the centrepiece of  " gentleman jim "  as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork ,  but he is also backed up by a literate ,  warm and funny script ,  and raoul walsh's direction .  every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it's pace ,  he truly was a born film-maker .  walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully ,  as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant ,  great final scene between ward bord and flynn .  add to that great production values  ( the  " gay nineties "  never looked better !  )  and a lovely supporting cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment .  alan hale usually played flynn's sidekick ,  but here is his father ,  and it still all works .  alexis smith is flynn's love interest .  the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other . 
i was really surprised with this movie .  going in to the sneak preview ,  knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i'd seen ,  i thought it was going to be a dude where's my car kind of crap fest .  i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work .  instead i got a smart ,  surprisingly original movie about a decent ,  average guy who just never had sex .   yes ,  the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple !  ,  but it's done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys .  all the characters are people you probably know in real life ,  redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives .   i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap ,  and i was very surprised .  yea ,  it's pretty over the top  ( c'mon ,  it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin !  )  ,  but it's very smartly done .   in the end ,  you're really pulling for this guy to get laid ,  which says a lot about the movie because honestly ,  did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not ? 
ok ,  plain and simple ,  if you are a fan of the other tomb raider games  ( yes ,  even aod )  keep away from legend .   it is ,  without doubt ,  the most disappointing tr game yet .  it looks very nice ,  it sounds very nice ,  but it is totally unplayable and i've given up .  i feel like i've been robbed by eidos .   it's very simple .  tr was a pc game before anything else .  you control lara using the keyboard .  in 6 tomb raider games the controls were standard .  in aod they were 'tacky' ,  but still the same general control sequences .  in legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollable .   i have seen comments elsewhere from people who say 'use the mouse' .  no ,  why should i ?  others say 'use a gamepad' .  no ,  why should i ?  others say 'but this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years' well ,  i don't care ,  it is not the standard for any other tr game so why mess with it .  oh ,  i know ,  because they couldn't care less about their original ,  loyal fan base ,  they want to cash in on the new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money .  pathetic .   my advice to any serious tr fan is keep away from this game ,  and if you do buy it complain to eidos .  i have seen masses of other posts ,  mainly on the eidos forums ,  from people telling them how rubbish it is ,  perhaps they will listen . 
this is not a children's movie !  !  !   this movie is like a  " bad acid trip "  for kids under the age of 5 .  for a month my 4 year old from time-to-time would ask me  " why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth "  or  " why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits ?  "  .   ( and that wasn't the worst of it )  .  we stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done .  intensely morbid ,  oppressive ,  violent .  fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing .  whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges .   .  .  .   ( go ahead censure me ,  my conscience is clear .  )  . 
first off ,  let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff .  i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled .  star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts .  so i have a soft-spot for fanpro stuff that means i'll overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badly .   so on to st :  hf .  well ,  first off the good things .  enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and ,  for the most part ,  the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles .  next ,  the effects aren't bad for a home-brew effort ,  with nothing to make you really wince .  the stories aren't too bad either .  nothing particularly innovative ,  but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story-arcs .   but it has a lot of faults .   first off ,  although they quite obviously have to rip-off star trek footage ,  set backdrops ,  music and effects ,  i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other sci-fi musical score ever made .  everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another .  likewise ,  much of the footage is from other movies ,  dutifully cgi'd over to make it look different .  the grey warships ,  for instance ,  though disguised ,  are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars .  and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers .  likewise ,  sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters ,  as does animated over footage .  in one scene in either first or second season ,  i think ,  you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle ,  which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours .   acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch .  everyone does improve as the seasons progress ,  though ,  but expect to grimace at the screen a lot ,  especially in the early seasons .  they've also made some interesting acting choices .  let's just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to  " cake "  and leave it at that .   make-up effects are generally quite effective on the whole .  but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or  " passing "  shots .  they are just beyond unrealistic .  every time i saw one of these  ( apart from trying not to laugh too much )  i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that  " this is a stick-up !  "  in one scene a  " cardassian "  actually talks whilst wearing one of these .  not only do the lips not move ,  but the mask doesn't even have an opening where the mouth should be .  someone needs to be slapped hard for that .  couldn't they have taken a craft knife to it ,  for goodness' sake !  there are also some well-done ,  but unintentionally funny make-up jobs ,  such as the herman munster look alike .   the writing ,  though coherent ,  is nothing new .  instead the script runs like a continuation of ds9 ,  with the ships heading out from ds12 on various missions .  the new enemy ,   " the grey "  aren't very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads .  i . e .  starfleet meet the grey ,  the grey are hugely powerful ,  starfleet barely escape with their lives ,  then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc .  all done before with the borg .   another bone of contention is the dialogue .  star trek writers have long had the ability to write  " insert technobabble here "  into a script .  it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using  " quantum phase discriminators "  or  " isolytic charges "  etc .  in other words ,  nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand .   the words are just gibberish really .  i've no problem with this ,  but where st : hf makes a mess of it is where they include real-world comments into this concept .   tactical advice such as  " we need to regroup "  sounds good ,  but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group .  likewise when asked what the situation is ,  a tactical officer is heard to reply  " we count three battleships "  .  he actually needed to count them ?  c'mon !  i expected the questioner to ask him  " are you sure ?  "  or  " can you double check "  .  but my all-time favourite comment is this :    captain :   " can we establish two-way communication ?  "   comms officer :   " no ,  we can only send and receive .  .  "   well ,  duh !  .  .  .  .  .   having said all the above ,  the show does improve as it goes along .  seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad ,  3 shows an improvement but 4 & 5 are where it starts to get noticeably better .  season 6 so far looks quite reasonable .   i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though .  quicktime sucks ,  quite frankly and the sooner they move to divx/avi format the better .  some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor .  not only does quicktime make this difficult ,  but the 320x180 resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well .  in fact ,  it makes the shows pretty unwatchable ,  like they were a tenth-generation vhs tape copy .  the least they could do was to include a hi-res downloadable option .   anyway ,  the show has promise ,  and i'm even beginning to like some of the characters .  but that's 40 episodes on ,  so i'm not sure this says that much about character development at all .   but what can you say ,  it's free .  .  .  .   ps :  out of 28 votes ,  19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10 .  hmmmm .  .  .  were we watching the same show ?  or are you 19 all three year olds ? 
loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager . the movie ,  was presented well ,  with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing .  many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter .  the progression of situations were cleverly written , making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious .  too bad there have to be commercials . i have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view again . i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue .  husband and wife heated discussions ( or should i say fights ?  )  were very realistic . the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not . i want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film .  thank you !  looking forward to the next films---when ?  whidbey
beginning with the poster  ( featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey )  ,  the entire movie was a fraud .  one stereotype after another ,  this movie was about nothing - or nothing new ,  at least .  after 10-15 minutes ,  you realize that you've just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop-flick .   basically ,  the story is about the corrupt system in some city ,  all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town ,  under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician .  the almighty and above-the-law organization is called frat and guess what ?  they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects ,  girlfriends ,  you name it .  frat cops are corrupt and greedy ,  so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented  (  !  !  !  )  journalist .  one hour later ,  after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines ,  everything ends happily and we get served the final line  :  you can't beat the system .  bah !  don't see this waste of film roll .  freeman and spacey barely have 10 min altogether ! 
i have seen the perfect son about three times .  i fail to see how this film is a gay film ,  i am not even gay ,  but i don't see it as a gay film .  it is a film with a gay character ,  i can't see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay .  i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death ,  the death of someone who is your kin .  i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life .  i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving ,  ryan states that he doesn't want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone .  isn't that horrific and sad ?  i highly recommend the film . 
this was surely the stupidest ,  crudest ,  most repulsive film i have seen in quite some time .  i was tempted to turn off the vcr ,  but ,  as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident ,  i literally found it compulsively hateable in every conceivable way and slugged it out through to the end .  i am by no means a prude who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen .  animal house ,  porky's ,  there's something about mary ,  both american pie movies ,  and even the notorious freddy got fingered i have found highly enjoyable on their own crude terms .  mamie van doren's breast-baring sponge bath is the most horrifying appearance by a naked geriatric since the shining .  ineptly edited and shot ,  with incredibly annoying performances from devon sawa and jason schwartzman ,  the film ended ,  without the benefit of having made me giggle once .  the only useful purpose for the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a gross out picture .  oh ,  and it would also serve nicely as a lawn fertilizer . 
i really enjoyed this movie .  typically ron howard who seems to like being associated with michael keaton .  love the scene when hunt travels to japan with his sales pitch .  whoa ,  how did that get in there  !  cheap laughs but great value
i hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time .  the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall !  this one was definetely fresh and witty .  if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings ,  only a few women have voted !  i don't want to ruin the movie for you but i'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score ,  why ?  because the movie puts men in their place ,  that's why .  if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men .  .  . it could easily be a  " 7 "  rated movie ! 
what can i say ,  i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain ,  hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya .  soraj have always been different .  movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times soraj creates something thats hard to find .  love and joint family that loving and great .  vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage .  shahid has done fine work .  anupamji as always brilliant .  amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she doesn't suit in that role .  we've seen her in ishk vishk and ab ke baras ,  and main ho on na .  so quit different role that she isn't in to .  she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she could've put little more in the role .  anyways great going work by barjatya .  this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot .  sweet film of the year .  great music and lyrics .  i am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original .  soraj's movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him .  great work by all the cast the crew and everybody .  lovely family film to enjoy with your parents ,  siblings ,  friends and love ones .  i give it 10 out of 10 . 
what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both .  there really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character ,  but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other .   this film features jon voight's finest performance and probably dustin hoffman's as well .  the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns ,  though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors ,  including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film .  also ,  for those interested ,  andy warhol's apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene .   if you haven't seen this movie ,  it is essential .  check it out . 
this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the tokugawa shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist ,  who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan .  really ,  i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background .   shintaro katsu  ( also known as the original zatoichi )  gives a superb performance as izo okada ,  one of the four hitokiri ( =human slayer )  of the bakumatsu .  he is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth .  in order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of takechi hanpei  ( played by tatsuya nakada = ryonosuke out of sword of doom )  .  hanpei is a ultra-nationalist politician who lets his band of hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro-west politicians in order to achieve his political goals .  izo okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing .  as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore .  okada's killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes .    it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening .  first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with sakamoto  (  who is a samurai who rejects violence )  does he change his ideas and views on life .  but too late .  .  .  .   watch the movie to see the end of izo okada .  .  .   shintaro katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance .  each actor reaches up to their role .  the sword-fights a very unique and fast .  .  . probably faster than several movies nowadays .  .  .   check it out if you have the chance !  !  ! 
this movie is outrageous ,  funny ,  ribald ,  sophisticated & hits the bullseye where 99 % of hollywood movies don't even make the target .  paul bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any era .  he's the american renoir & bunuel _ combined !  !  !  glad i have the videodisc . 
i have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down .   why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be .   this film is supposed to be a light hearted ,  tonge in cheek ,  family comedy ,  things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults ,  and that is exactly what this film does .   i laughed my nuts off at this film ,  i thought carey put in a great performance and the whole film  ( if watched at christmas )  really give you a bit of festive cheer  so to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not  " taxi driver "  or  " the godfather "  and take films for what they are supposed to be ,  entertainment !  ! 
beautifully filmed ,  well acted ,  tightly scripted suspense movie .  had me on the edge of my seat .  i liked the lead actress very much ,  and thought the villain was very well done .  not much to chew on here in the way of a theme ,  but if you just get in your seat ,  turn your brain off ,  watch the fancy camera work ,  and enjoy the plot ,  you will have a great time .  the plot is well worn ,  and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in .  but that didn't bother me ,  as i enjoyed watching it unfold .  in the old days ,  they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters ,  and there were some enticing moments when i hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines .  but these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused .  the plot got me by the throat fairly early on ,  and never let go .  it's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie .  as i'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense .  just sit back and enjoy . 
there isn't more i can say that saying this film was awful .  the whole chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell .  but telling the audience that every chinese knows chinese history without even studying it just laughable .  that is like saying every american knows american history without studying or every filipino ,  etc ,  etc .  it just isn't believable .   the story is flat out hideous .  it talked about shin being from a monastery in china - later identifying it from bejing .  however ,  the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on mongolia .  i know the current chinese regime wants to claim areas like mongolia for its own ,  granted .  but its a distinct nation and it even labels  " mongolia "  on the map .  did disney studios fail 5th grade geography ?    the relationship between wendy and shin is superficial at best ,  and yet she somehow feels connected to him .  her training is just cheesy as well .  and ,  lets cut to the chase :  everything about this film is bad .  its bad enough to laugh at and cry over .  the taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances .   the evil eyes thing was cheesy .  however ,  the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it .  they should have left the evil eyes ending in it .  but instead somehow evil is defeated .  yey !    overall , not worth the time of the dog in the film .  brenda song should get on with another studio .

in a series chock-full of brilliant episodes ,  this one stands out as one of my very favorites .  it's not the most profound episode ,  there's no great meaning or message .  but it's a lot of fun ,  and there are some fine performances .   but what makes it really stand out for me is that it is ,  to my knowledge ,  the *only* twilight zone episode with a *double* snapper ending .  the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story .  but this time ,  you get a surprise ,  and think that's that ,  but it turns out there's *another* surprise waiting .  i just like that so much ,  that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes  ( the other being a deeper ,  more message-oriented one )  . 
i had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time ,  after seeing  " return to paradise ,  "  which i found to be gritty .  i was so disappointed .  the most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which i think was partly stolen from  " return to paradise .  "    maybe i was expecting too much .    on the positive side danes ,  beckinsale and pullman were fantastic in their roles .  although i didnt like danes's character and first and found her very annoying .    i couldnt see anything realistic about the film .  it could of been done so much better ,  for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror .  it was too cheery a movie to be realistic .  there could also of been more action and tension  the best thing about this film is the  " tragic "  ending .  i couldnt of predicted that .  but by that time i really didnt care what happened to them .   3/10
ruth gordon at her best .  this episode is my favorite of the whole columbo series .  peter falk and ruth gordon worked so well together that they should both be inducted into the television hall of fame ,  regardless of the rest of their work .  even the music was outstanding in this episode . 
i would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered .   why i didn't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say .  i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately !  !  several people in our theater did and sadly i didn't follow them out .   the story lacked all criteria for a movie .  no plot .  awful acting !  even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in .  not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk .  i did like the tazer scene .  too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot .  someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film ! 
i grew up baptist and i know the story this movie is trying to tell ,  although i no longer believe the story .  i'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average lifetime movie of the week .  mildly interesting ,  mediocre acting ,  a bit slow ,  the script is predictable ,  the music is sappy ,  and it is a bit melodramatic .  and all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-christians ,  ever .  not a single curse word from any of them .  but i laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the united nations pronounced  " nuclear "  as  " nu-cu-ler ,  "  just like bush .  is there some christian code of honor that mandates that since bush claims he ,  too ,  is called by god ,  that all christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does ?  lol !  i really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that .  after the  " nu-cu-ler "  incident ,  the movie began to feel like packaged ,  manipulative propaganda .  i was looking for something bold .  actually ,  i was looking for something that might make me think ,  but i didn't find it here .  if you're looking for mindless entertainment ,  stop here - it's good for killing a rainy afternoon .  but if you're looking for intelligence ,  look elsewhere . 
i think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments .  there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene ,  but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud .  jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself .  apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies ,  after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end .   ( which is better than most of them ,  where you already know after +/- 5 minutes )  .  anyway ,  better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick .  .  . cheers
nothing to say but wow !  has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field ?  well this happens about 25 times in this movie ( clearly the directors' favorite scare tactic )  .  in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking/hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film .  shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and ,  although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute .  after about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown's history in which we see some of his previous victims .  if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest .  .  her ribs go all the way to her neck ,  it was flat out disgusting .  most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day .  the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard .  the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically .   definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field .   signed ,  the answer
this movie was made in 1948 ,  but it still rings true today .  very ,  very funny .  it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it  " builds "  from there .  anyone who has ever built a house ,  will find this movie very endearing .  great cast .  cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film .  this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's .  .  .  . clothing ,  architecture and family life .  many references are made to the cost of things ,  and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing .  i can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely .  i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it .  a true classic . 
ever since i remember ,  i have loved airplanes and flying .  i am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become a commercial .  i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me ,  this was it .  my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid .  i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re-cite it today .  it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd's soon !  it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless .  i cannot get enough of this show . 
 " i'll take you there "  tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date .  unlike most romantic comedies ,  this little indie is mostly tongue-in-cheek situational comedy featuring rogers and sheedy with little emphasis on romance .  a sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving ,  stays fresh ,  and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers . 
better than the typical made-for-tv movie ,  invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting  ( urich ,  lucci ,  cassidy ,  mccarthy ,  pre-murphy brown joe regalbuto ,  soleil moon-frye )  and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot .  urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles .  kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live ,  the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy ,  maudlin denoument .  7/10
this electrifying musical has more than a whiff of egotism from it's star ,  the musical genius that is prince .  the film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic .   much like other films that centre around the struggling young musician trying to be big ,  this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the musical numbers .  while this film isn't as good as 8 mile as a recent example ,  this is entertaining none the less and the soundtrack is much better .  on the dramatic side of things the story centres around the kid  ( prince )  a young artist and regular spot at a club .  the owner of the club is frustrated with the kid's arrogance and little does the kid know that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival .  one the side the kid's parents are having trouble ,  with his dad abusing her violently .  during the course of the film the kid learns a few lessons in life ,  and learns to appreciate his friends more .  it's all stuff we have seen in coming of age dramas of course ,  but this is combined as a musical ,  a very stylised musical .   the cast are good .  prince is actually quite good on the drama side ,  when he's not striking a pose .  he seems human and relatable .  clarence williams is very good as the abusive father as well .  appollonia kotero makes a good debut as princes sexy love interest .   the main strength of the movie however is the superb soundtrack .  the musical numbers are well staged and electrifying .  prince is no doubt a musical maestro ,  albeit very eccentric .  when he is inspired he is great but on the flip side he will often do songs that are solely for his own taste ,  and occasionally his experimentation can miss-fire ,  but that is the same for many musical geniuses .  the soundtrack for this film is excellent though ,  with only sexshooter being a weak point .  the show-stopping performance of purple rain is the standout though .  it is one of my all time favourite songs .  ***  
i'm a fan of columbo ,  especially on a rainy saturday ,  and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit 451 ,  but this episode was very lacking .  the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance ,  even years before the modern detective shows of today .  but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and  " modern "  electronics equipment and ,  of course ,  the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale .  the high-tech home is a jetson's or disney version of tomorrowland ,  and fun to think of writers inventing those  " way-out gizmos "  .   if its sunny outside ,  go play ,  as there are much better columbo episodes .  still ,  we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast . 
mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion ,  and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do .    but come on hollywood - a mountie telling the people of dawson city ,  yukon to elect themselves a marshal  ( yes a marshal !  )  and to enforce the law themselves ,  then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town ?    nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush .  mr .  mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood ,  the canadian north for the american wild west .   canadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot ,  or ,  to shake your head in disgust . 
star rating :  ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits   mike atherton  ( dudikoff )  is peacefully making his way in the wild west when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady .  being a gentleman ,  he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty enforcer .  this is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner .   m dudikoff is an action star who's never truly managed to take off with me .  maybe i discovered him too late and after the other film i saw with him in it last monday ,  the human shield ,  it was just another dud  ( ha ha )  added to the list .  but i have a thing for westerns ,  being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts ,  as his films go anyway .   the film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain ,  sounding like a blank marlon brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast ,  along with the obligatory cheap looking sets .  but if ,  for some strange reason ,  your life ever depended on watching a dudikoff film ,  this would be one of your best choices .  ***
there is no suspense in this serial !  when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy ,  the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day .  no ,  in fact ,  the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode !  this show is so boring that i can't see how it ever got made ,  let alone released on dvd !  obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films ,  but even the script is awful .  an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that ,  i am not quite sure ,  because it is too awful to follow .  watch the 60s version ,  or the 90's versions ,  or even batman begins ,  just anything over this version ! 
although it's an r rated movie ,  i really doubt that you'll really enjoy it unless you're a teenager  why ?  because there's no real plot ,  no character development , no funny jokes .    the only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity .  tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks  ( pretty nice ones i might add )  to feast your eyes on .   i really can't understand why this movie has the american pie title since it's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them .   my suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks ,  but you're too shy to rent/buy an erotic movie .    gave it 1/10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2/10 for the nice chicks
having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical ,  there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can't do anything film a bad script ,  and in some cases don't seem to care .   well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release ,  it is good .  the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry .  i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role ,  ok he's not oscar material yet ,  but he'll learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here .  dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie .   ultimately ,  just give it a go .  you won't be disappointed ,  you won't be bored ,  in fact ,  i think you'll be more than happy with the end result . 
ok ,  this movie was cool .  i don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun .  my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while ,  and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard ,  blow off the dust and pop it in .  enjoyable all the way until the end ,  but a great concept .  this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy .  judgment is victory for robot jox . 
note that i did not say that it is better .  .  . just more enjoyable .  the lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving .   i was actually sort of surprised that this was not a troma movie ,  as it has all the troma trademarks ,  including spewing acidic liquids ,  wisecracks from the villain after every murder ,  a ridiculous bathtub rape scene  ( which is sort of hard to get upset about ,  since the rapist is a snowman )  ,  and dumb deputies .   there's a lot to love :    1 .  a snowman ,  about whom it is remarked that he has no legs or feet ,  drives a police cruiser around town .   2 .  even though it is supposed to be close to  ( or below )  freezing ,  nobody's breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are running .   3 .  the snow reminds you more of flocking or styrofoam peanuts than actual snow .   4 .  a teenage girl gets the hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is gruesomely murdered .  she talks him into breaking into the sheriff's house ,  of all places ,  in order to get it on .  but first ,  she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine .   5 .  after teen-aged jake's head is cut off by a sled runner ,  his father argues with the sheriff about whether tommy ,  the sheriff's son ,  had anything to do with it .  the sheriff maintains that tommy wouldn't have been fighting with jake because jake  " is at least two feet taller than tommy .  "  at that moment ,  someone in the background chimes in ,   " not anymore !  "    6 .  when the evil snowman finally starts to melt away ,  the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period .  this is much better than tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions .  if i were an actor ,  i would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point .   all in all ,  a fun film .  there's not really even that much blood . 
great movie when i saw it .  have to say one of my favorite movies of all time .  i saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the dvd .  as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average .  compared to movies that are known ad good comedys ,  this is nothing .  i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great .  also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking .  it's like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch .  i like the movie overall so i give it a .  .  .   still a good 7/10 for me . 
if you came into the film with expectations ,  throw them away now ,  because no amount of hype will do this film justice .   to categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal .  it's a spy thriller ,  has elements of noir ,  bits and pieces of action ,  science fiction ,  and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative ,  mind-bending plot twists ,  and gorgeous cinematography .   a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative ,  both in good and bad ways ,  of other movies .  but as they say ,  every story cribs from shakespeare ,  so once you can get past that ,  you're in for a hell of a ride .   you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points ,  and while the set never becomes unbelievable ,  there are portions  ( read :  the elevator )  which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals .  don't misconstrue that to mean it's on the same level as cheesy sci-fi channel movies ,  though ,  because this is on a much higher level .   if you're looking for action ,  you should turn away .  this is pure psychology .  but if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience ,  by all means ,  do it now !  watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it ! 
the script is nice . though the casting is absolutely non-watchable . no style .  the costumes do not look like some from the high highbury society .  comparing gwyneth paltrow with kate beckinsale i can only say that ms .  beckinsale speaks british english better than ms .  paltrow ,  though in ms .  paltrow's acting lies the very nature of emma woodhouse .  mr .  northam undoubtedly is the best mr .  knightley of all versions ,  he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like mr .  knightley in the tv-version .  p . s . the spectator cannot see at all mr .  elton-ms .  smith relationship's development as it was in the motion version ,  so one cannot understand where was all emma's trying of make a elton-smith match  ( besides of the portrait )  . 
this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film  ( along the lines of tales from the crypt )  written by robert bloch  ( author of psycho )  .  it's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast .  the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee  ( the third doctor )  has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star ! 
any true wrestling fan would have to consider this wrestlemania to be one of ,  if not the best of all time .  it was packed with excitement and surprises .  one of the greatest matches of all time was between shawn michaels and steve austin with special guest ref mike tyson .  the show that michaels put on was unbelievable ,  especially considering the shape that his back was in and that this was his last match . 
i loved this movie .  it is a definite inspirational movie .  it fills you with pride .  this movie is worth the rental or worth buying .  it should be in everyones home .  best movie i have seen in a long time .  it will make you mad because everyone is so mean to carl brashear ,  but in the end it gets better .  it is a story of romance ,  drama ,  action ,  and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in .  i love a lot of the quotes .  i use them all the time .  they help keep me on task of what i want to do .  it shows that anyone can achieve their dreams ,  all they have to do is work for it .  it is a long movie ,  but every time i watch it ,  i never notice that it is as long as it is .  i get so engrossed in it ,  that it goes so quick .  i love this movie .  i watch it whenever i can . 
i had some expectation for the movie ,  since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif .  well ,  i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom 2 ;  but if dhoom 2 is compared to tashan ,  i would say dhoom 2 is very realistic .    when i saw the credits at the beginning ,  i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way .  well ,  the very first scene itself pis*ed me off .  then ,  the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences .  me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights .  it was like akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns !  phew .  .  . you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are .   the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story .  it reminded me of some of the early 80's movies .   well ,  the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena ,  who looked really hot in this one . and for that ,  i give a rating of 2 out of 10 .   guys ,  please .  . please .  .  . don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie .  well ,  you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes .   thats all . 
drew latham ( ben affleck ) is determined not to be lonely this christmas .  not only is drew a millionaire ;  but also obnoxious and guilty of being very grandiose .  drew goes back to the home he grew up in and offers the family living there ,  the valco's ,  $250 , 000 to be his  " family "  through the christmas season .  tom valco ( james gandolfini ) is reluctant ,  but is greedy enough to take drew's offer .  christine valco ( catherine o'hara ) has little to say in the matter ,  but learns to like having drew around .  .  . not exactly the same sentiment with daughter alicia ( christina applegate )  ,  but that too has room for change .  drew's girlfriend missy ( jennifer morrison ) tracks down drew and wants her folks to meet his family .  genuine fun is in store as a happy noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare .  other members of the cast :  josh zuckerman ,  bill macy ,  david selby and stephanie faracy .  affleck is comedic ,  albeit strange . 
i thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it .  the actors were on top of their character's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great .  the music was lush and well-thought-out .  it even had a decent twist of an ending .  so what's with everyone voting it down ?  the story wasn't entirely fresh  ( felt like a remnant of  " running man "  with the whole television show idea )  ,  but the attitude towards christianity and judaism about how the public picks their messiah certainly sounded true enough .  it made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity .   it's possible that christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word  " god "  in it ,  but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this ,  especially in the modern world where christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some .   i gave it a 7/10 stars here on imdb .  i thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original ,  for the most-part .  check it out if you're not too offended to see an entertaining film from madrid ,  spain ,  about possibilities of the coming modern messiah to a tv near you . 
this movie is soooo funny !  !  !  the acting is wonderful ,  the ramones are sexy ,  the jokes are subtle ,  and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his/her school .  i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism .  if you like monty python ,  you will love this film .  this movie is a tad bit  " grease " esk  ( without all the annoying songs )  .  the songs that are sung are likable ;  you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through .  this musical ranks number two in musicals to me  ( second next to the blues brothers )  .  but please ,  do not think of it as a musical per say ;  seeing as how the songs are so likable ,  it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place .  i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance .  you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager ;  needless to say ,  you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film .  highly recommended for both the family  ( since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience . 
i agree with everything people said on this one but i must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst one i have ever heard my entire life !  there are actual vocals during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk !  and the vocals are like a broadway version of danzig singing ,   " the darkness of the forest !  oh the darkness of the dark ,  dark forest !  "  or something else so unthreatening .  the singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble-y microphone over some synthed-up string section and fake drum beats .  it's horrible !  !    yes ,  the male leads are awful .  so are the female ones .  this is one bad case of gender stereotyping - it's so bad !  everything they say revolves around being a male or a female ,  just playing up the stereotypes to the max .  makes me sick .  soooo boring !  !  !    the children were so echoey in their lines ,  you couldn't understand them .  and why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair ,  pretty blue dresses and long hair ?  and ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair ?  not scary - stupid .   daddy's face was way too blemish free and clean to be that of a man living in a cave .  nice beard and bangs ,  pa .  did you perfectly cut those with a knife yourself or did you stroll into town and go to the salon ?   stupid movie . 
sondra locke stinks in this film ,  but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway .  unfortunately ,  she drags everyone else  ( including then =real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her .  but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one ?  one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer .  it's an exceptionally weak story ,  basically no story or plot at all .  add in bored ,  poor acting ,  even from the normally good eastwood .  there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned ,  this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers .  wow !  could a film be any more boring ?  i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun .  a real stinker .  don't bother with this one . 
spanish horrors are not bad at all ,  some are smart with interesting stories ,  but is not the case of  " second name "  .  it is badly directed ,  badly acted and boring .  .  . boring .  .  . boring ,  a missed chance for an interesting story . 
this is one of my all time favorites .  it is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy .  i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it .  .  .  one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed walters  " are you thinking what i'm thinking "  and ed says  " now what are the odds of that happening !  "  in my opinion ,  a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it ,  and with this one ,  you can !  !  i also really enjoyed walter m . s way of portraying einstein .  i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely .  there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as i watch it !  i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel-good romantic comedy now and then ! 
this is one of the worst movies i have seen recently .  when a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself i pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies .  the bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public .  from the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting ,  how long its been since they got some ,  when their next sexual liaison will be ,  and with whom it should be with .  on top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced ,  not felt ,  and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes .  this could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here .  please ,  do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it . 
anna christie  ( 1931 )   on its own terms ,  this version of garbo's anna christie ,  shot a year later in german with a whole new cast ,  is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the english version  ( both are american mgm productions )  .  garbo is if anything more commanding  ( or more beautiful as a screen presence )  and her acting is more restrained .  and she seems frankly more at ease ,  probably for a lot of reasons ,  but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture ,  so had adjusted quickly .   without comparing always one film to the other ,  this anna christie is still the same o'neill play with too many words .  his themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here ,  but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway .  there are some scenes missing--the coney island section is shortened and isn't as good--but overall it's a direct echo of the first film .  the director ,  jacques feyder  ( belgian-french )  ,  is simply redoing what was done already ,  which i assume must be a frustrating experience .   it's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way  ( not only the sets ,  but the shots ,  are all the same )  .  there is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film--some of the storm ,  understandably ,  but also a brief scene where marie dressler  ( from the english language version )  is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal ,  drunk as can be .  but they are just silhouettes ,  and when the next scene shows their faces ,  we see the german actors taking their parts .  there is no replacing dressler ,  for sure ,  but for me the german father is more believable and honest in his performance .   clearly the themes--immigration ,  wayward fathers ,  daughters turning to prostitution ,  and the troubles of finding true love--have strong currents back then ,  especially with european threads  ( garbo ,  appropriately ,  plays a swedish young woman )  . 
don't look for an overdeveloped plotline here .  .  .  . just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one .  a gallery of stars pop up as the classic cartoon character's villains in this live action comedy ,  which features incredible makeup and set design ,  not to mention knockout performances from beatty ,  madonna ,  and pacino .  great fun for kids and adults alike .   *** out of ****
simon's best comedy is superbly crafted by director gene saks and given life by the immense talents of lemmon and matthau .  no one delivers these lines better .  no one times them better .  nobody does it better . 
this is a nice little movie with a nice story ,  that plays the most important role in the entire movie .   it's a quite intriguing dramatic story ,  with also romance present in it .  the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up .  the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors .  normally i'm not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good .   of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies ,  produced in the west .  in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era .   i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better .  for a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences .  this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically .  not that this is a bad thing ,  it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre .   but oh well ,  this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it .  in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint .   8/10
kim basinger stars as della ,  a housewife who has twin children  ( terri and tammi-played by luke gair and erika-shaye gair )  and an abusive jerk for a husband  ( kenneth )  ,  played by craig sheffer .   the movie opens on christmas eve .  kenneth is on his way home from work ,  driving a nice car too i might add .  he is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner i would assume .  when he gets home ,  he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about .  this angers him even more and he takes up with his wife ,  della ,  asking her why the house is always a mess .  he pins her up against the wall .  the twin's watch from the stairs .  he punches the wall ,  leaving a hole in it and walks away .  she tends to the children ,  trying to comfort them .  after that is all said in done ,  she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of wrapping paper .  she gets there and the parking lot is full because there is a lot of last minute shoppers there .  while she is looking for a parking space ,  she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her .  she finally finds a spot to park ,  makes her way over to the hoggish car and leaves a note under the wiper calling the owner a  " selfish jerk "  .  then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping .   when she finally does leave the mall ,  it is closing and many people have left already .  not the owner of the car she left the note on however and she notices this on the way to her vehicle .  she also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there .  odd .  when she gets to her vehicle ,  she gets in to start it up .  she notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up .  she gets out of the car only to be confronted by the owner of the car  ( chuckie-played by lukas haas )  she left the note on and a posse of his thug friends .  yelling ensues and a mall cop  ( no ,  not paul blart )  makes his way over to them to see what the problem is ,  only to have his brains blown out of his head by chuckie .  while this happens ,  della jumps in her vehicle ,  starts it and drives over the median in front of her .  chuckie and his posse hop in his car and give chase .  della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development but she is unharmed .  she manages to make it to the back of her vehicle ,  open up the hatchback and grab a toolbox before the thugs get there .    with that ,  della spends the rest of the night trying to outrun and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her toolbox as weapons .  the first kill ,  in my opinion ,  is the best .  the first kill that della performs anyway .  the last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was offing .    i will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and i was let down a bit myself .  as a whole though it was a fun flick and moves along nicely at it's 1 hour and 20 minute run time . 
i usually enjoy loretta young's early movies :  her acting back then was light and breezy ,  and she sure knew how to wear clothes .  but this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by glenda farrell .  young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer-husband  ( paul lukas )  into becoming a championship bridge player .  it's not the most cinematic of games ,  and the long ,  talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film .   there's one interesting bit though .  as lukas and ferdinand gottschalk start their climactic game ,  a series of quick shots show airplanes ,  trains ,  football games ,  even a diver in mid-air ,  freezing in anticipation of the event .  it's the earliest use of a freeze frame i've seen in an american film .  wish the rest of it were that inventive-and funny . 
this film is a true and historical film .  it is very useful to those researching the lds church ,  because it is 100% true .  it is an excellent film and i recommend it .   it is very factual ,  exciting ,  and motivational .  there are some who think it is not factual ,  but it is .   it is about the restoration of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints ,  and about the prophet ,  joseph smith ,  who restored it .  it has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy ,  his courting emma smith ,  emma ,  his wife ,  giving birth ,  and so on .  but most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church . 
this 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better michael curtiz's film  " angels with dirty faces "  .  as directed by ray enright ,  the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in america's inner cities today .   the film is only worth seeing because of the presence of ann sheridan and ronald reagan ,  who showed they were well paired together .  the dead end kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks .   in a way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in new york .  it was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created .  in today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality .  the young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals .  how times change ! 
what a movie !  i never imagined richard attenborough could have such a movie in him .  gandhi has always left me indifferent ,  apart from ben kingsley's performance ,  and i never considered attenborough a particularly good filmmaker .  but cry freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times .  it's an exciting ,  mesmerizing political movie with great performances by kevin kline and a young denzel washington .   kline plays donald woods ,  a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist steve biko .  it starts as a difficult friendship ,  for woods sees biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites .  but biko ,  with his kind words ,  upbeat attitude and complete transparency ,  wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing about .   biko is a decent ,  law-abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people .  one night ,  coming from an illegal meeting ,  he's arrested and beaten to death .  the authorities try to hush up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa .  but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out .  but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret police .   this movie has an interesting structure .  it has in fact two narratives :  first it narrates the life and death of biko .  it's an amazing first half ,  completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yet .   the second half ,  no less interesting ,  narrates woods attempt to escape from south africa to publish a book about biko .  woods has become an enemy of state ,  a banned person ,  which means he can't meet people or leave his country .  plus he's constantly spied by the police .  kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half too .   although the first half is quite straightforward ,  the second does interesting things with editing ,  by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the repression against the black south africans .  some may argue this is to make it more interesting ,  but for me the second half just as captivating ,  as woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape south africa .   the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears .  george fenton and jonas gwangwa's score certainly had something to do with it .  although i've never been much of a fan of fenton  ( cannot stand his gandhi score )  ,  i do think the score for cry freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema .  the movie ,  thanks to the music married to the powerful images ,  at times reached incredible peaks of emotion .   cry freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of denzel washington .  this is a movie to be cherished in its entirety .  acting ,  writing ,  music ,  editing ,  cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit .  this movie deserve a place alongside movies like the pianist ,  life is beautiful and the shawshank redemption . 
trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality ,  but these scenes are just rare fragments ,  picked out to attract audience .  they are ,  of course showing the main message of the movie :   people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives ,  using power ,  which they may have somewhere else ,  to notoriously oppress others .  and at the low end of the oppression chain ,  mostly women .   a movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face ,  but having to endure such lives ,  is even tougher .   technically the film is much like short cuts ,  but consisting of documentary style episodes ,  featuring people like your neighbour ,  playing just the way they are .  without any glitter ,  and most disturbingly ,  without any hope .  its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing ,  because you realize ,  such people are out there ,  and there are many of them ,  although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks .  somewhere the porn industry has to do its business ,  somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place ,  somewhere hopes have to shatter .  i sure do know such people .   if you want to see a movie without any funny scenes  ( some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny ,  but this happens for real )  and without any melodramatic ,  go watch this movie .  however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear ,  as subtitles can´t transport accentuation . 
it's like this  .  .  .  you put in the dvd and the most professional-looking thing you see over the next ninety minutes is the logo of the distribution company .  and at this point ,  you know you've just been jerked around .   people are generally trusting enough to assume that if something has been put on dvd ,  it's going to be of a certain level -- at least financially if not creatively .  but sadly this isn't the case .  distribution companies are perfectly happy to throw together dvds of amateur movies and ship them right out into the stores to await the unsuspecting buyer who is drawn in by the well-designed dvd cover .  the weight behind this particular project is most likely independent horror movie pioneer kevin j lindenmuth ,  whose name may be known amongst genre fans since he's responsible for various other low-budget werewolf movies --  " rage of the werewolf "  ,   " werewolf tales "  and so on .    " blood of the werewolf "  is made up of three short independent werewolf stories with no real connection other than the fact that they deal with hereditary shapeshifters .  the first segment ,   " blood reunion "  ,  pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing  .  .  .  a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on ,  only to find that her domineering grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men ,  and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret .  this instalment is poorly directed ,  poorly directed ,  and basically nothing superior to what you could throw together yourself with a few friends and a home video camera .   the second story ,   " old blood "  ,  is probably the strongest out of the three and is directed by lindenmuth himself .  it tells the story of a lesbian couple ,  one of whom is a shapeshifter and the other wishes to be given this power .  her wish is granted ,  but she doesn't become the creature that she envisioned .  this short movie shows that lindemuth has more talent and experience than the other filmmakers who worked on this project ,  but still not enough to raise it above the level of an amateur movie .   and finally we have  " manbeast "  ,  in which some army guy runs through the woods while being chased by two other fellas .  they wish to kill him as he has been bitten by the beast and is believed to be dangerous ,  but all might not be as it seems .  this one has an interesting concept ,  but it's stretched out to be far too long ,  and if you don't guess what the  " twist "  is in the first ten minutes then you probably ain't too bright .  this pretty much sums up the problem with this whole dvd  .  .  .  a few good ideas just aren't enough to justify spending money on something like this .  after all ,  would you pay for a picture you could have painted yourself ? 
the information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately .  the walter reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return .   what this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars .  the psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life .  they are not just changed or affected ,  they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves .   finally ,  this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma .   we have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion ;  but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war .  it doesn't matter what side you are on ,  it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business .  this film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly . 
blue monkey  ( 1987 )  or 'invasion of the bodysuckers' as it's known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant !  !  !  !  the man gets rushed to hospital ,  where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth ,  of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage !  !  despite steve railsback and john vernon being in the movie ,  i found it to be boring ,  with a flat predictable storyline ,  un-interesting characters ,  cheap special effects and lack of action !  !  !  !  horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down ,  you wont be missing much trust me !  !  !  i give this movie 2/10 . 
me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them ,  trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs .  s . i . c . k .  is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we've rented .  the plot is over-done ,  the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old .  the goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat .  and if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to cartoon network for the rest of their life ,  it's pathetic .  the good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot ,  one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie .  the other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry .  i don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos ,  i don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting . unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls i would recommend it .   if your renting/buying it to laugh at it i'd give it an 8 . 5 . 
i can't say too much about kalifornia as sadly i have yet to actually see the whole thing  ( i've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on fuse .  )  but what i have seen is absolutely awesome !  i am a fan of brad pitt but i admit not all his earlier movies are well good .  but this role ,  i just ,  his acting is great ,  his character early seems so normal well okay creepy ,  dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type i guess .  and juliette lewis's performance although i can see how some may be annoyed by it i think it's amazing .  sadly i have yet to see the end ,  but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good ,  but disappointing .  i have to admit that i wish david duchovany's  ( sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect )  was a bit flat but for him it was okay .  his wife's character was better ,  and i thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good ,  a portrait of the avant-gard/older sister type .  particularly the scene where early and brian go to play pool ,  and adele and carrie are having their one on one time together .  i've watched that scene at least twice now and i still think the acting in it is just wonderful .  one because of the emotion that adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about early and carrie's reaction to it .  everything about that i think is just so perfect .  i mean ,  maybe it's because i can relate a bit ,  i'm not sure .    as for brad pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once ;  i thought he was great .  some movies with pitt that i've seen were just average or not worth seeing .  i don't think i've ever seen a terrible pitt movie or if i have it's not because of his acting it's other factors .  this movie was not one of them .  he turned out a great performance in kalifornia .  i swear i'm not just some random i do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking ,  i mean his character in this movie isn't exactly handsome or cute by any means !  pitt is dark ,  brooding and downright scary at times .  yet he's also cheerful ,  funny ,  nice ,  and even loving towards adele .  granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the tv and strangle him but that's probably just me  ( and the character pitt played in the movie .  )  but it also shows how good pitt's acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character ,  that is what good acting is supposed to do .    at any rate i wish i could say more ,  but that's all i can really say without having seen the ending ,  i have seen most of the movie through what i've caught on fuse and as i'm writing this i'm taping it on dvr so hopefully i can write a more complete review later .  i just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that i thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked  ( it shouldn't have !  ) 
given its time of release ,  the story that unravels in 1950 thriller 'panic in the streets' was hardly a surprise .  the corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague .  yet with the current drama in the world today ,  this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers .  the cast and crew are flawless .  richard widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in 'night and the city , ' jack palance in his chilling film debut ,  also starring in this film are paul douglas and a young  ( and rather cute )  barbara bel geddes .  a whole slew of uncredited ,  non-professional actors  ( typical of director kazan )  fill in the remaining slots .  elia kazan directs ,  joe macdonald films  ( he would later work with richard widmark again in 1953's much superior 'pickup on south street' )  and the great alfred newman scores it .  nearly everyone involved here has done better work ,  'panic in the streets' is quite the rewarding watch ,  nonetheless .  especially for the film-noir enthusiast . 
i was expecting the movie based on grendel ,  the book written by john gardner in the late 1970's .  it was based on the beowulf epic ,  but told from the perspective of the monster .    whatever you may think of gardner's book ,  a movie based on the beowulf epic should not be entitled grendel ,  when it doesn't say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the cg monster is shown as nothing more than a modified predator .    on top of this ,  the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass tv audiences throughout the us .   typical hollywood to get this so wrong .    very disappointing and a complete waste of time . 
we laughed our heads off .  this script is so incredible you either zap to cnn or go to sleep .   my dad was a sea captain for 30 years ,  he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie .   during his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship ,  the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey/daily and  ( sorry )  s**t on his desk .  of course this was not on a nuclear mission .   for instance ,  the fire in the kitchen ,  fire is the most important thing on any ship ,  nuclear or not .  to give a drill at that time is just hollywood script .  when a captain is put under arrest ,  he is under arrest ,  you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept .  this is stored within minutes in a well guarded room .  he cannot escape ,  it's just like in prison .   funny thing is ,  my dad also had a dog on board ,  however ,  we see how hackman let him pee in the control room .  this is not done ,  ever .  my dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was .   hackman and washington make the three stars this movie is credited for ,  all the rest is bulls**t .   when we do know that 23 people were still alive on the koersk ,  this film gets an extra dimension .   if you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent :  thas boat .   
#1 vampires vs .  humans  #2 military-reject roughneck squad as first responders to dangerous ,  unknown vampire incursions .   #3 sexy female vampire on the side of the  " good guys "  .   #4 plenty of gore and action .   there are four  ( 4 )  major plot devices that may help you decide if you want to watch this movie .  if you want all four ,  then the next plot device may not deter you .  .  .   #5 in outer space .   that last one almost got me too ,  but i'm glad i watched .  in a pile of terrible direct-to-video horror that is the sci-fi channel halloween marathon .  .  .  this movie is a breath of fresh air .  it will stand-up against any of the other sci-fi channel offerings ,  and even against the other vampire movie natassia starred in  ( who keeps giving uwe boll money ?  )  . 
expecting a combination of scifi and period film about ada lovelace ,  charles babbage ,  the history of computers ,  etc ,  i was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history .  it gives the impression that its writer  ( lynn hershman-leeson )  has no real understanding of the math ,  technology ,  or history constituting the film's subject ,  but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them .  this hits a sore spot with me ,  as i've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion ,  eg :  emmy coer :   " information waves have a half-life "  ,  ada :   " i'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all "  .   this movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms .  the only redeeming value i can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts .  it's more likely ,  i think ,  to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic . 
while rehearing carmen of bizet ,  the middle-aged choreographer antonio  ( antonio gades )  brings the sexy carmen  ( laura del sol )  to perform the lead role .  antonio falls in love for carmen ,  who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love .  when carmen has an affair with another dancer ,  antonio is consumed by his jealousy like d .  josé in the original opera ,  entwining fiction with reality .    " carmen "  is another great movie of carlos saura's trilogy dedicated to the flamenco dance .  the dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing ,  and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality  ( with the dancers )  or fiction  ( of the play )  .  paco de lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous bizet's opera ,  which is based on the novel of prosper mérimée .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " carmen " 
like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film ,  especially the  " film makers were then attacked "  aspect that the case seems to emphasize ,  what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob .   then ,  to watch the film and discover ,  oh ,  what they mean by  " the film makers were attacked "  was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said  " someone should beat those two kids up .  "  the picture on the cover ,   " the chase "  as it were ?  total fabrication .  which i guess ties in with the theme of the film ,  lying and manipulation to satisfy vain ,  stupid children with more money and time then sense .   i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film .  it's like michael moore's  " roger & me "  ,  but if  " roger & me "  was moore mocking the people of flint .  it's completely misdirected and totally inane .  wow !  can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food ?  what jerks !  and it's not so much ,   " look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah "  ,  since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors ,  it was that ,  as many people in the film say ,  the prices were absurdly low ,  someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck .  that's not proving anything except that people who are poor ,  will go to a store that has low prices ,  bravo fellas ,  way to stick it to the people on the bottom .   way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people .  you should be very proud .  how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then ,  say ,   " haha !  no such house exists !  your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media !  "  .   morgan  " please like me "  spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him .   avoid like the plague . 
by 1909 ,  d . w .  griffith had been directing films for the biograph company for about a year ,  and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker .  'the sealed room' is a very interesting 11 minute short ,  a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror .  the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen poe's 1846 short story ,   " the cask of amontillado ,  "  and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wife's infidelity .   set in medieval times ,  'the sealed room' begins with the king  ( arthur v .  johnson )  overseeing the construction of a windowless room from a sequestered dove-cote ,  the idea being that he and his wife  ( marion leonard )  will have a completely private place to enjoy each other's company .  he is obviously very much in love with her ,  always showing his affection ,  this latest act the crowning achievement of his endearment .  however ,  unbeknownst to the king ,  his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel  ( henry b .  walthall )  .  during one romantic liaison inside the specially-built room ,  the wife and the minstrel are discovered ,  and the heartbroken king conceives a means of getting his retribution on the ignorant couple .  silently ,  he orders his workmen to seal off the only doorway with stone and mortar ,  slowly descending into cackling insanity as each new stone is placed down .   d . w .  griffith always had an eye for acute detail ,  and 'the sealed room' is an excellent early example of this .  the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality ,  and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable .  at the time ,  the director was also pioneering methods of creating suspense ,  and i must admit that ,  as the film progressed ,  i became fixated on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers .  in the early minutes ,  griffith restricts his shots to lengthy long-takes from a stationary camera  ( as was usual at the time )  ,  but soon  parallel to the progressively darker subject matter  he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way .  though he may not have invented the technique ,  griffith was crucial in popularising the use of  " cross-cutting "   that is ,  alternating between different events occurring at the same time .  not only does this create a sense of continuity ,  but it also maximises the level of suspense ,  since we ,  as the audience ,  are well aware ,  not only of the king's ghastly actions ,  but also that the wife and the minstrel are oblivious to it all .   despite these innovations ,  'the sealed room' suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era .  the entire film takes place in just two rooms ,  with footage captured from a total of just three positions ,  and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times .  the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect ,  however ,  at least in the case of arthur v .  johnson ,  his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king .  a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room ,  only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone .  their panicked reactions ,  accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king ,  serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia .  i did think ,  however ,  that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly . 
meatball machine is an amazing splatter film ,  it has an original plot with young love ,  buckets of blood ,  and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines .   now the film isn't for everyone ,  people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo :  the iron man will applaud it .   the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film ,  but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously .   yet ,  all in all it's a lot of fun ,  well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles . 
the story idea behind the lost missile isn't bad at all ,  but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub-par level .   the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth .  in a panic because it's about to strike the earth ,  the soviets manage to deflect the object .  this isn't necessarily good ,  however ,  as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet .  in other words ,  with each pass it makes ,  a swath of death follows--one that could potentially kill us all !  !  so ,  it's up to the good scientists of the us  ( led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia )  to formulate and plan to save us--and especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path !  unfortunately ,  they aren't able to save ottawa  ( i've never been there ,  so i can't say whether or not this is a big loss )  but thanks to good old american know-how ,  they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction !  !    so ,  as you can see ,  the story idea isn't bad and rather original .  but ,  so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding .  overall ,  a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like--all others ,  see it at your own risk . 
this is an action western .  james steart leads an all star cast in the scenic northwest ,  which is filmed in great splendor .  the scenery and costumes are great .  there is action and adventure .  stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old nothwest .   the main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that hollywood has always made into a hero .  even when this movie was made ,  the cynic was the stereotypical hero ,  and the one stewart portrays really has few saving graces .  he is kind to his two partners ,  and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability .   however ,  he is so piggish to everyone else ,  it is hard to really care for him ,  or to accept him .  he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters  ( cut not that bad )  .   still ,  the minor characters are quite enjoyable .  walter brennan ,  royal dano ,  harry morgan ,  and others make this worth watching . 
i'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private .  however ,  pushing daisies is my exception .  i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show .  i was skeptical about it at first ,  especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head .  here we go again ,  i thought .  i watched the first ,  second ,  third and all the other episodes .  wow !  first of all ,  i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid .  the characters were engaging and i like the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life ,  chuck without the consequences of her dying .   most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have .  besides ned and chuck ,  olive longs for ned .  lily and vivian longs for their niece chuck and emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve .  i think the characters are picture perfect and believable .  i like how emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american ;  i like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him .   all in all ,  this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i've seen out of the 2007 season .  i think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs .  i just wish the writers would get back to work ,  so that the show can continue to evolve . 
considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film .  the acting for the most part is great ,  although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best .  however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent . 
being a slasher film aficionado ,  i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas ,  which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain ,  i will say .  while channel surfing the other night ,  sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me .  of course ,  i wanted to check it out ,  as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise ,  but have never actually seen any of them  ( for shame ,  i know )  .  i will note that since i have not seen the original ,  my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously ,  because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise's own design .   now i'm assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is ,  in itself ,  a joke on itself .  hell ,  even the name comes off as an intentional joke .  sleep away camp ?  it's good fun .  i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value ,  but that's about as far as i can go .  the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth .  campy requires bad acting ,  but come on .  pamela springsteen as the evil out-of-touch-with-reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast .  as far as comedy goes ,  there were a few times where i chuckled ,  but it was few and far between .   ultimately ,  sac ii is pretty boring ,  and i really did want to sleep away the camp .  the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them .  if you're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp ,  i recommend club dread .  if your channel surfing takes you across this one ,  check and see what else is on . 
this movie is finally out on dvd in italy  ( completely restored )  .  i have seen this movie so many times and i find it even actual these days  ( 2003 )  when italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship  ( or the us for that matter )  .  i am glad there are outcasts as the one played by mastroianni in this movie who can sing out of tune ;  maybe they can teach the sophia lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognised as human beings .   back to the movie :  as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing .  i must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you don't understand the italian language but i can assure you that the show-off of machism ,  the distortion of reality in that ever-present radio-chronicle of the hitler visit to rome can really make you shiver !   a masterpiece !   
i saw one of the stage performances in denver and have never been less impressed .  the word  " vagina "  says it all .  a body part .  nothing shocking here .  i could say to my doctor ,   " my left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis "  or  " my vagina hurts after cycling "  with equal or more social commentary .  it could be the  " tricep monologues "  for all the entertainment or radical comment i heard .  the monologues were dull but delivered with drama ,  the topics were outdated ,  and i was alternately bored and annoyed .  once i think i laughed but apparently it wasn't when i was supposed to .  surely this isn't really a hit .  oh ,  and spoilers :  there was a lesbian !  - oh ,  wait ,  maybe not ,  come to think of it .  and inappropriate fondling !  and a crack mama !  that about covers it . 
this movie is horrible ,  but you have to see it because of that .  i'm not here to discuss the entire film ,  just the greatest chase scene ever .  when eddie dumbs milk on tim ,  he gets chased down the hallway .  eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences  ( like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player ;  buy the dvd and watch it slow )  .  the best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door .  but when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics  ( mainly friction )  ;  yet what lies behind the door is supreme .  the steepest stair case in any school ever ,  which this jock proceeds to clear in the air .  in reality he probably would die of a broken neck .  not only does he defy all concepts of reality ,  he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation .  go and buy this one .  trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks . 
i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv ,  long before a live-action version was so much as a twinkle in peter jackson's eye .  .  .  and being very impressed .  finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away  ( and isn't that just par for the course .  .  ?  )  i had the chance to revisit this film ,  and found that it still stands up quite well ,  although it's not quite the success that memory had painted .   i have to confess to a certain bias here .  some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jackson-lovers ,  others as jackson-haters ;  i'm not exactly either .  i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in 1981 ,  and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here -- peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note-perfect for the radio three years later .   i must say ,  however ,  that where i found jackson's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment ,  the bakshi version ,  for all that it has been cut to the bone ,  is actually more accurate .  yes ,  there are the usual ,  understandable changes  ( here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party )  and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action .   ( the only exception to the latter ,  as others have remarked ,  is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell ,  where the ringwraiths ,  having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in mid-flight -- which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river -- then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop ,  which is initially nightmarish but pointless ,  plot-wise ,  and definitely goes on too long .  )  i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory ,  due partly to bad animation ,  and that gandalf windmills his arms too much .   but having watched both approaches to the film ,  i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take .  in a tale that is half-myth  ( oddly enough ,  one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorn's story of beren and luthien )  the extreme literalism required by live-action filming ,  where everything from monsters to mail-shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera ,  is counter-productive :  latex-faced  ( or cgi )  monsters are less monstrous than sketchily-drawn shapes ,  heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies ,  and hobbits or dwarfs with non-human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly .  many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods ,  with its crippled ,  half-human movements ,  as one of the scariest moments in the film -- it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark !   the extreme stylisation of the introduction  ( plus a voice-over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back-story in a few sentences )  works very well to depict an almost mythical era ,  and the change to the comic-book rusticism of the shire -- i particularly like the proudfeet -- corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of tolkien's prose .  i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect :  gandalf threatening bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes ,  bilbo seeming to become a gollum-like creature under the influence of ring-lust at rivendell ,  and galadriel's famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight ,  where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits' changed perceptions .  but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette -- firelight hues at bree ,  bright colours re-emerging at rivendell and in the fangorn clearing ,  dirty greys and browns for moria and the desolate lands -- work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes ,  where a live-action approach simply doesn't allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised setting .   as a fan i didn't care for either jackson's or bakshi's depiction of lothlorien -- again ,  i feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation i've come across of a beautiful ,  slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time -- and i feel that bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong ,  but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their travails in moria .  aragorn giving a hobbit-fencing-lesson here is as charming  ( and equally uncanonical )  a spectacle as boromir engaging with the hobbits in hollin in the jackson version .   the depiction of aragorn as convincingly weatherworn ranger is good throughout this film  ( viggo mortensen's scruffy jesus look really didn't work for me )  ,  although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to 'clean up' the character in the second half for gondor's benefit .  john hurt ,  unsurprisingly ,  gives a sterling vocal performance ,  as does a resonant william squire in the part of gandalf .  the hobbits are ,  i suspect ,  intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience-identification figures :  i find the animated style  ( their proportions are much more 'cartoonish' than those of the human characters )  works well to differentiate them ,  and the whole 'hairy feet' thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions ,  including much fan art .   personally i have less objection to boromir as viking -- he was always a fairly bludgeoning type -- than to beardy-aragorn  ( illogical :  they were both numenorians ,  after all )  ,  although i am clearly in a minority here !   the big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project ,  with a bizarre tacked-on voice-over ending attempting to resolve matters .  a pity ;  it would have been interesting ,  not to mention less frustrating ,  to see what bakshi planned to make of shelob and minas tirith ,  never mind the dead .  .  . 
i can't agree with any of the comments .  first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel ,  it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think it's an all different matter .  i couldn't believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly .  the plot may be as bad as a js's show  ( ie there is no plot )  but the acting is wicked ,  it's hilarious and it's all in all an incredible trash movie .    it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society ,  and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america  ( and i believe there are plenty of them  !  )  are interested in .  after all it's the neighbours we're talking about ,  don't we  ?   100% fun  ! 
this is possibly the worst fencing ,  sword-fighting ,  movie ever made .  that is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot ,  characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and ,  later ,  supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying ,  i suppose to maintain audience interest .  what a waste of f .  murray abraham's talents .  you're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like zorro ,  scaramouche ,  anything that has basil rathbone as the villain .  as a fencer myself i recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film ,  but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher ,  better drawn characters and a plot with more depth . 
is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television  ( or the media in general )  as the 1960s ?  no .  and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time ?  not really .  but if we must have one ,  does it have to be as shallow as  " the '60s "  ?    i like to think that co-writers bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted ,  especially given couturie's involvement in the superb hbo movie  " dear america :  letters home from vietnam "  which utilized little original music and no original footage ,  letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves .  this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production ,  but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time ;  like so many of its ilk ,  it's seen from the point of view of one family .  but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s  ( it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont )  ,  making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade .   the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character ,  with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children's father is especially clichéd - and then when they're back on blammo !  it's something else .  garry trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly .  in fairness ,  jerry o'connell ,  jordana brewster ,  jeremy sisto ,  julia stiles and charles s .  dutton give their material the old college try ,  but they're wasted  ( especially the latter two )  ;  it's undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton ,  and rosanna arquette  ( in an uncredited cameo in part 2 )  is always welcome .   what isn't welcome is how  " the '60s "  drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect  ( and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post-60s america never mentions the british invasion - no beatles ,  no rolling stones .  .  .  then again ,  there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album ,  right ?  )  .  capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending ,   " american dreams "  and  " the wonder years "  did it all much ,  much better .  nothing to see here you can't see elsewhere ,  people .  .  .  except for julia stiles doing the twist ,  that is . 
full marks for the content of this film ,  as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii .  a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world .  however ,  the movie is pathetic ,  direction is non existent ,  the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another .  i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together .  this could have been a great movie ,  the story for many of us outside of the us was new ,  unique and also interesting .  the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together .  it is unfortunate that a true story like this ,  which could have changed people's attitudes ,  has been squandered on a low budget ,  badly directed movie .  i only hope that some time in the future ,  one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice . 
i'm not a follower of a certain movie genre .  i classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial .  valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks ,  after his urban legends .  unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak .  yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic ,  and that is what makes valentine the best .    as the first basic and iconic element ,  the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth .  since his secondary school years ,  he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends ,  who have made fun of him .  when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie ,  you will come to see this point of view of humanism :   " noone is entirely good or evil .  in fact ,  somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted .  "  just because the story line and the direction is very weak ,  we are not as satisfied as we deserved .    the second iconic element is ,  of course ,  the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets :  my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed .  an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in ,  while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date ,  never able to met with .  katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables .  denise richards is killed third ,  while she just found a valentines' day gift for her at a whirlpool bath .  jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way ,  then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer .  marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know ,  'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed .  finally ,  benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer ,  david boreanaz .   the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene ,  the valentines' day celebration at dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes .  everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know .  hard rock never suits better within a serial killer-mystery movie . 
i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music ?    is the cartoonish acting of howard desilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children ?    is william daniels' campy contemporary  ( for the time )  acting style meant to appeal to a 1960s/70s demographic ?    do we need all the  " in-jokes "  about ny & nj ?   ( i can hear the blue-haired broadway audience guffawing on cue .  )    sorry ,  i find the whole piece dated ,  boring & the acting far too strident for the screen
after a few lean years ,  1968 was a pretty swell time for elvis :  not only did he make that celebrated  " comeback "  tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  speedway and live a little ,  love a little .  therefore ,  personally i can forgive him for the misstep that was stay away ,  joe which ,  at best ,  emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering .  sure ,  burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing  as ,  respectively ,  a dopey indian father to elvis' character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on mr .  presley too - but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado  ( as meredith's mexican wife )  ,  the two jones  henry and l . q .  - and thomas gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud who is meredith's stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day !    while there is a surprising  ( if not unwelcome given their usual blandness )  lack of songs ,  there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all parties were the male indians hit the bottle steadily while presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs !  as can be expected ,  the typically 'western' arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy ,  snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point .  on the other hand ,  the climactic 'destruction of the house' episode is one we've seen too often since and doesn't work too well here .  .  . 
anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist ,  a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet .  is jake  ( a mesmerizing anthony demarco )  simply  " transferring "  the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image ?  or could the creature be real ?  writer/director shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing .  her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia .   brooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry ,  but loving parents .  however it is the creepy minor characters ,  mrs .  bender ( barbara gruen )  ,  an unhinged babysitter and sam stone  ( ben bode )  ,  a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind .  jake's closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell . 
1936 was the most prolific year for astaire and rogers .  their second film for rko that year is the third film in this collection  mark sandrich's 'follow the fleet . ' this time out astaire is painfully uncomfortable as bake baker ,  a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront café where sherry martin  ( rogers )  is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyone's ear .  yep ,  you guessed it  they're hot for each other once again .  only this time sherry's spinster sister ,  connie  ( harriet hillard )  threatens the whole fine romance by falling for bake's robust seafaring buddy ,  bilge smith  ( randolph scott )  ;  a sort of use 'em up and toss 'em out kind of guy ,  thus forcing sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general .  irving berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic ,  classy score ,  including standards 'let yourself go' ,  'i'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'let's face the music and dance ; ' the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for fred and ginger .    the transfer on 'follow the fleet' is a tad weaker .  the gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it's a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles .  grain is still present .  so are age related artifacts .  once you've settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality ,  the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage .  the audio is mono but very nicely balanced .  extras include a featurette ,  theatrical trailer and short subject ,  but oddly  no audio commentary .  considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of astaire/rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from warner home video . 
i won't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground .   just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the film very much .  peter falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film .   a small scale 'road trip' movie with falk & paul reiser in upstate ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film .   very well written with an adult target audience in mind .  plenty of reality based humor & some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family .   really can't say enough about this film except that it's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does .   it's great to see falk with a big leading man role again & he makes the most of it .  it proves that his famous friend & writer/director john casavettes was right in casting falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s & 70s . 
i saw this movie at a 'sneak preview' and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much .  this picture was the worst .  half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film .  i couldnt blame them ,  if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture .  just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear . 
this movie was like  " the disney channel after dark .  "  take out the  " aren't we naughty "  language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe  " saved by the bell "  as quality television .  the dialogue so laughably cliched and knowingly dirty ,  one might think the screenplay was the product of locking aaron spelling and joe eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating .  if that was roger kumble's intention ,  mission accomplished . 
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen .  i feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey .  one sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that  " history repeats itself "  .  life is what it is shown in the movie :  when people are young ,  they seem not to understand their parents ,  their own spouses ;  people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late ;  people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners ;  people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives ;  people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved ;  nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world ,  and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves ,  so that when life has to end some day ,  people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope ---a new life .  the actors and actresses are fantastic .  they have understood the director's intention perfectly .  the movie's charm lies in ,  to me ,  the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience . 
i haven't seen it in over twenty years .  oj was the bus driver ,  arte johnson was the tour guide ,  lorenzo was the kidnapper .   yea ,  lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain ,  a natural .  i think i watched it back then most for oj ,  who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing ,  but also to see arte johnson .   i was a little bored that johnson was so serious .   and yes ,  it shifted plots .  in reading other posts ,  i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl ,  but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue .   i was going ,  a stamp ?  if it came on as a late movie ,  i would probably record it to check it out again ,  but i wouldn't be nostalgic over it .  not yet anyway .   there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out . 
the first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen .  it was a bad version of 'back to the future' with zero charm .  once accepted that bill & ted are nitwits ,  the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks .   this is a surprise .  this is your only spoiler warning .  .  .   by today's standards ,  this is more fun .  this was shunned upon release ,  sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time .  we get the photographer of 'face/off' ,  the editor of 'fugitive' ,  a production designer from burton's early work ,  and the sound designer of 'matrix' .   the writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep .  since this was shunned by the fanbase and public ,  the director probably decided the style was too extreme .  it's not ,  it fits the material .  like 'death becomes her' and 'catch-22' ,  this dares to be smart ,  but we like our movies  " simple "  so we don't buy it .  probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off .  what's so good ?   --nice self-reference towards keanu ;  from airhead to messiah .  see also arnold schwarzenegger .   --joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts ,  he makes his own hatred .  the evil b&t and the  " good robot usses "  have the same vocabulary as their originals :  lesser copies and depreciation of language .   --the  " duality "  motif .  nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles ,  lots of high and low angles .  they even use roy brocksmith from 'total recall' to emphasize the point .   --the  " choices "  motif .  i don't know where this started in the genre  ( maybe 'ghostbusters' )  ,  but it's used pretty well here .  it even boils down to the 7 games against death--battleship and club .   --film self-reference ,  even present in the game against death  ( clue )  .  this is smarter than tarantino or brooks .  notice the premier magazine cover at the end :   " bill and ted :  the movie .  "  ironic also how death and nomolos were villains in the 'die hard' and 'lethal weapon' sequels .   i still have some minor nits ,  but nothing compared to the original .  music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former--particularly in the teen market .  carlin is a great comedian ,  but in these movies he's wasted .  also ,  for all the daring this effort shows ,  even cracking gay jokes ,  they can't kill a cat ?   so ,  despite looking like a nickelodeon production ,  this is incredibly interesting .  from this movie we got beavis and butt-head .   " we're in heaven and we just mugged three people .  "    final analysis = = midrange material
pros :  akshay kumar's performance ( is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump ab in their movies together ?  )  .  some touching scenes in the 2nd half .   cons :  the whole 1st hour ( the jokes were flat to say the least )  .  every scene involving rajpal yadav .  major stupidity in ab's decision making .  let me get this straight ,  he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way ( that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair )  is a better way for him to make akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth ?  ?  wtf ?  he considers akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father is soon gonna die due to cancer ,  but thinks insulting him will make him stronger ?  am i the only one who doesn't see the logic here ?  easily the movie's biggest flaw .   - akshay becoming a stunt man .  lmao !  !  we're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in mba .  but when the time arrives to support himself ,  and his pregnant wife ,  he becomes a stunt man .  lol !  !  how abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field ?  or heck ,  anywhere else where ur life isn't in danger ?  this is some incredibly dumb writing .   - the ending .  i hate this sort of melodramatic crap .  everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for ab's character ,  which i couldn't .  the entire thing reminded me a little too much of srk in khnh ( which i hate )  .  this  " please feel sorry for the guy with the illness "  crap has run its course .  i felt more like puking than sympathy for the old man .  couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd .  the whole thing .   bottomline :  waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie .  its obvious director vipul shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense .  give 'em some decent song picturizations ,  fancy outfits ,  plenty of glycerin-filled scenes and some star power and they'll happily lap-up crap like this . 
so i'm looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called 'end game' .  it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller .  well worth a look then .  or so i thought .   boy ,  was i wrong .   end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring .  now being something of a whodunnit ,  i can't really tear into it as i would like without 'ruining' it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity .  but questions such as 'why has he/she/they done this ? ' ,  and 'where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off ? ' are all too abundant following the film's unintentionally hilarious conclusion .   as for the acting - you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor's realised that they've made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie ,  and this then shows in their performance ?  this is one of those .  accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed ,  irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison .   of course ,  this didn't make it to the cinema ,  and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room ;  it is appalling . 
this is a great film classic from the 40's and well produced .  there are very dramatic scenes in this film with john garfield ,  ( al schmid )  ,  " force of evil "  , '48 and dane clark ,  ( lee diamond )  ,  " last rites "  , '88 ,  fighting the japs during wwii being completely surrounded and with only one machine-gun .  when al schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury ,  his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend .  dane clark gave an outstanding supporting role as lee diamond ,  who did everything to help his buddy al get his life together again .  there is never a complete victory to war and lets not forget all the brave wounded military personnel in veterans hospitals from all the wars and our present iraq vets ! 
several young iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain .  when they're caught ,  they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot ,  but out of sight .  the prisoners plead to be let go ,  but rules are rules .   given the pedigree of its director ,  jafar panahi ,  it was disarming to discover that offside is a comedy ,  and a frequently hilarious one .  in 1997's the mirror ,  panahi presents two versions of iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is  " real "  .  in 2000's the circle ,  several iranian women step outside the system ;  their transgressions are different ,  but they all end up in the same tragic place .   however ,  thinking now about offside ,  it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy ,  because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous .  as the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer ,  the only possible outcome is comedy .   what makes offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system .  they are simply soccer fans and patriots ,  and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly ,  they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp . 
alright this was quite a sensitive little number but i can't help thinking i've seen it before .  reminds me of another vca film i saw at poitier called  " the other days of ruby rae "  also had specks of  " welcome to the dollhouse "  and  " ratcatcher "  and lynne ramsay in it's execution .  which is not to say that they're not tasteful references .  .  . just that they feel very modern and very fashionable .  .  . which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising  ( as an approach in style and story )  than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come .   the cinematography is just .  .  . too perfect for my liking .  too coral filter  ( or charcoal )  for my liking .  .  . too archly framed 12mm .  therefore the entire impression left me a little distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily !  the french  ( they are a conservative bunch )  seemed to buy it as did the jury however .  .  .  but cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it's feature selection although i wonder what's been happening in the last few years . 
the first time i came upon delirious ,  i only heard it .  i listened to the entire comedic performance and never have i laughed so much in my life .  eddie's ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating .  when i finally got to see him perform this act ,  i had to have it .  eddie murphy's performance on delirious shows his genius !  with it being the new millennium ,  his acts in 1983 is just as funny today as it was then .  my parents loved it as teenagers and i  ( age eighteen )  love it as well .  from that point on ,  i had to view murphy's other movies such as coming to america and harlem nights .  there will be no other comedian like eddie . 
so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills :  natica jackson .  or power ,  passion ,  murder as it is called in holland .  when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality .  unfortunately ,  it didn't .   1 )  the plot of the film is really confusing .  there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film .  only they have nothing in common .  throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me .  but it still hasn't .   2 )  the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson .  well it is ,  sometimes .  like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest .  so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice .   to conclude my story ,  i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs ,  on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it .  by doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life ,  as i did . 
this is really a great unknown movie . perfect dialogue without the typical clichés . this movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off . it even had a little bit a comedy in it , but it wasn't overdone . once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be , not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in . i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all .   now onto the actors themselves .  laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal . it's a shame that he's only allowed to show his talent in his own movie .  titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne's junky half-brother .  eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film .  paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey/drug lord . i loved his acting since  " king of new york "  .  but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan , who were paired perfectly as two of calderon's henchmen .   once in the life is for sure a keeper .  ****1/2* out of ***** . 
oh my god .  the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me .  besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old .  the plot ,  the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace .   i am not usually this critical about any movie ,  cause every person has his/her style .  but this movie ,  however ,  was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008 .  i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown ,  and i think it should stay like this ,  for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke .   i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies ,  or even simply movies to stay far away from this one . 
a few years back the same persons who created paris , j'taime .  ,  which was imperfect but very enjoyable  (  my rating was a 7 )  ,  created this piece of garbage about new york city .   in paris ,  i love you  ( j'taime ) created a feeling for paris & it was made in many parts of beautiful paris .   in this current film ,  i did not recognize new york city ,  i did not feel that i was in the city of my birth .   new york does have 5 boroughs , i saw no scenes in the bronx ,  or queens  , there is one scene in brooklyn ,  ( brighton beach )  ,  i saw no scenes in times square or greenwich village/ no scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres .  it does have a large cast , most of the performers were not even stereotypes ,  they were caricatures of the lowest sort .   the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know & love .  .    a few of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were far better .   ratings :  *  ( out of 4 )  20 points  ( out of 100 )  imdb 1  ( out of 10 )   in my way of thinking i think the title should have been  new york ,  i hate you . 
you just got to love opening sequences like the one in  " seven women for satan "   during the intro there's a naked girl running through the woods ,  chased by a hunting dog and a malignant looking dude on a horse ,  until she falls off a cliff and splits her head open on a rock .  then the camera zooms out on the face of the guy and we notice how he's simply sitting behind a desk whilst his secretary waiting for him to sign some papers .   " oh i'm sorry ,  i was lost in my thoughts "  he then says !  sweet ,  i have stumbled upon yet another completely bonkers movie .  even if you only understand a minimum of french and have a look at the original title ,  you immediately know that  " seven women for satan "  hasn't got anything to do with satan or ritual sacrifices ,  but simply revolves on the flamboyant escapades of a perverted and mentally unstable count during his weekend in the countryside .  this is ,  in fact ,  another sleazy variation on the classic milestone  " the most dangerous game "  about a lunatic's disturbing hobby of hunting people  preferably hot naked chicks - in the forest for sports .  well actually ,  this is more than just a variation on the 1932 classic ,  as writer/director/actor michel lemoine had the pretension to directly link his protagonist to leslie banks' legendary villain in  " the most dangerous game "  .  count zaroff supposedly is the original count zaroff's son but he exchanged his private island for the remote french countryside .  he also can't afford to be unemployed anymore ,  so he's an office clerk from monday to friday and a maniacal killer during the weekend .  zaroff is a genuine weirdo who hallucinates about dancing with deceased woman but actually runs his car over the live ones .  his butler once pledged to prevent the zaroffs from killing ,  but he's obviously doing a lousy job .  there isn't any depth in the screenplay and the build-up certainly doesn't pay attention to suspense or sinister atmosphere .  really ,  the only useful thing to do during this film is count the girls that are lured for zaroff's deceptive trap and hope they'll reach seven rapidly .  half of the film is pointless and tedious padding footage ,  like the overlong erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black guy  (  ?  ?  ?  )  ,  and the other half exists of psychedelic sleaze that eventually grows tiresome as well even though all the girls look ravishing .  i have the impression that it was michel lemoine's intention to imitate his pal jean rollin and make a deliriously kinky sex-thriller .   " seven women for satan "  is a french production ,  so inevitably it also stars jess franco regular howard vernon  (  " the awful dr .  orloff "  ,   " zombie lake "  )  .  lemoine himself surely has the looks of a crazy killer ,  but not the talent to depict one . 
a superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious russian serial killer andrea chikatilo .  magnificent performance from stephen rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation ,  who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the russian government ,  in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society .   the film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society ,  and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in russia ,  which is subtly put across .  there is a conflict of old ways and new ways ,  and these are represented by the two viewpoints of rea's superior  ( played by donald sutherland )  ,  and rea himself  .  these are at first polarised ,  with sutherland 'high' in system looking down ,  and rea 'low' on the ground ,  looking up .  however ,  they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer .   throughout the film the relationship between these two develops ,  and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie rea and sutherland and rea and sutherland have mutual respect for each other ,  the killer is caught ,  and glasnost symbolically comes .  excellent script .   further credits go to sutherland's performance ,  which is superb and sympathetic ,  jeffrey demunn as the killer whom we despise but can't hate ,  and max von sydow ,  who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help . 
this movie is a total dog .  i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn't feel like i'd totally wasted my money--and my time .  the writing in this film is absolutely terrible .  it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other hale storm movies .   they should have saved the money on getting d-list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right .  even gary coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role .   this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots .  after viewing this movie ,  i'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite-like humor ,  where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery .  unfortunately ,  this movie fails to deliver the lines ,  the characters ,  the delivery or the humor .  i should have gone to the dentist instead ! 
a longtime fan of bette midler ,  i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites .  bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads .  a literal rainbow of emotion and talent ,  bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire ,  as well as new songs from the  " bette of roses "  album .  spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone .  the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around . 
note :  these comments are for people who have seen the movie .   vanilla sky is a brilliant ,  complex ,  and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag-line says :  lovehatedreamslifeworkplayfriends .  maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie-goers if one looks at it from a different angle .   considering the following :   now ,  i have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene ,  so i will have to further examine my assertions ,   ( and i welcome your thoughts )  but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place :  where exactly does the debatable 'splice' occur ?   now ,  i'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the l . e .  'technician' ,  since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of david aames's mind/dream/coma state ,  but the true splice between reality and dream .   it seems to me that the reality of the car crash ,  the way that it is filmed  ( no explosion ,  for example )  is a likely 'splice' point ,  and that any particular sequence containing an existential/dream/coma/non-reality feel to it -- whether it's shown onscreen before or after the crash -- is actually a part of aames' personal journey toward self-realization inside of his own mind .   in that respect ,  then ,  we are left with two questions at the very end ( if you know of more ,  let me know )  :  is aames actually disfigured ,  and where does he wake up ?   if you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot ,  or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout ,  this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop-culture society .   
the arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the native american residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo .  .  .    the commercial killers ,  however ,  weren't the only ones shooting bison .  .  .  train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches .  .  .  there were even buffalo killing contests .  .  .   " buffalo "  bill cody killed thousands of buffalo .  .  .  some u .  s .  government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds .  .  .  the buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting .  .  .  few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds .  .  .     " the last hunt "  holds one of robert taylor's most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept taylor as a heavy guy .  .  .   his characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter ,  who kills only for pleasure ,  had its potential :  the will to do harm to another .  .  .    when he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker  ( stewart granger )  it is evident that these two contrasted characters ,  with opposite ideas ,  will clash violently very soon .  .  .   taylor's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts .  .  .  he also enjoy killing indians who steal his horses .  .  .  he even tries to romance a beautiful squaw  ( debra paget )  who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort .  .  .   among others buffalo hunters are lloyd nolan ,  outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner ;  russ tamblyn as a half-breed ;  and constance ford as the dance-hall girl .  .  .  but taylor steals the show .  .  .  richard brooks captures  ( in cinemascope and technicolor )  distant view of buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals .  .  .   the film is a terse ,  brutish outdoor western with something to say about old western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero .  .  . 
i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago ,  and said to myself ,   " seems funny ,  plus it has michael clarke duncan ,  how can i lose !  "  i proceeded to pay $15 . 99 plus tax for it .  i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted .  wooden performances abound .  all the  " hilarious "  and  " outstanding "  performances promised never seemed to arrive .  after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame ,  knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or $15 . 99 back .  i literally almost cried as well ,  because if that was what could be considered  " comedy "  i didn't want to believe in movies anymore .  my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was .  over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone .  this was my next horrible mistake ,  because as i watched i just became angry .  i began to yell at the movie ,  and i'm not one to talk to movies period .  everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen .  my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends ,  but that could not save this movie even .  the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding .  the fact that its rating  ( at the time of this writing )  is 3 . 6 is a crime against humanity . 
lol !  not a bad way to start it .  i thought this was original ,  but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong .  i never saw king kong until i was 15 .  i saw this film when i was 9 .  the film's funky disco music will get stuck in your head !  not to mention the film's theme song by the yetians .  this is the worst creature effects i've ever seen .  at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b-movies .  memorable quotes :   " take a tranquilizer and go to bed .  "   " put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power .  "  i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira .  there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse !  in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building ,  but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl  ( who was falling )  !  also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man  ( 1977 )  which came from hong kong .  there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts .  this film will leave you laughing .  it is like i said ,  just another king kong clone .  rated pg for violence ,  language ,  thematic elements ,  and some scary scenes . 
i rented this movie from the library  ( it's hard to find for good reason )  purely out of curiosity .  i'm a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment .  the bell jar  ( 1979 )  is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen .  the script is horrible ,  not because it strays from the original novel text ,  but because it strays without focus or intent .  the scenes are ill-constructed and don't lead the viewer anywhere .  what's with the hokey voice over of plath's poetry ?  lady lazarus has little do with greenwood's situation ;  plath's poetry was completely misused .  marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood  ( or any 20 year old for that matter )  partly due to casting  ( she was 32 during filming ,  the age plath was when she died )  and partly due to the fact that she can't act .  hassett is all emotion ,  no craft ,  no skill .  the direction is mediocre ;  the director simply covers what's there ,  which isn't much .  the only reason i'm giving the film a 1 is because 0 isn't an option .  sorry sylvia ,  you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting . 
i saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book ,  and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one .  i think it was the latter .  first of all ,  it was inaccurate in many small ,  yet important details .  one of the first things i noticed was ,  during winston's day to day life in his work ,  his conversations ,  eating in the cafeteria ,  etc .  he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear .  one of the most important parts of the book ,  was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face at any moment .  this is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions .  in the book winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip .  while in the movie ,  he does it so often and without fear ,  that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat .   other minor inaccuracies included winston hiding his diary in the wall ,  yes a very small change ,  but it begs the question ,  what's the point ?  there was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book ,  and that is morphing characters .    the large inaccuracies were far more disturbing ,  however .  first of all ,  one of the important pieces of the book is that big brother is a government based on an intelligent ,  yet crude philosophy .  in the movie ,  they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by hitler with technology .  which is true ,  in a sense ,  when directed with its facism ,  but if that's all you get out of big brother ,  you really missed the point of the book .  the terrifying thing about big brother is that ,  in a way ,  it has some points behind its philosophy .  when o'brien is picking at winstons mind in the ministry of love ,  he is listening to everything winston says against big brother .  the fact that he listens ,  and advances forward in his philosophy ,  is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing .  in the end ,   ( careful spoiler ahead )  when winston says he loves big brother ,  the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this ,  or the actual power behind the philosophy .  i am in no way saying that the big brother's philosophy has points that appeal to me ,  but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing .    also ,  how could anyone feel any connection between julia and winston in the film ?  it was awful ,  no connection whatsoever .    and where was o'brien before he gave winston his address ?  one of the things that carried the book was winstons thoughts about o'brien before he made contact with him .  in the movie ,  they just jump the gun .    but that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption :  because its impossible not to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours .  how could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours ?  at the very least ,  the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections .  anything less is just pointless .   if you loved the book ,  and i mean truly adored it ,  you will not approve of this movie ,  and chances are ,  you already knew you wouldn't .  because the book is unfilmable ,  and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film .   two stars out of ten
this drama is unlike sex and the city ,  where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other .  its much more personal and people can relate to it .  its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like  " sex and the city ,  lipstick jungle .  .  .  .  "    dr .  katie roden ,  is a psychologist with a dark secret ,  she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends .  she is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her .  her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well .    trudi malloy ,  a widow is battling issues with  " letting go "  of her dead husband from 9/11 .  and when a handsome stranger ,  richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business .  the ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between richard and trudi are totally funny !  it is interesting to note that richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9/11 board for her husband's death .  . lets see what his intentions are   siobhan dillon ,  a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve  " baby making "   ( as they are having trouble conceiving )  and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his  " services "  a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long ! it will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband  ( played by raza jeffrey )  jessica ,  a real estate business woman is single and is straight ,  until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them .  her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a  " married man "  ,  her colleague .  lets see where her character venture to .  .  .  .   the beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios ,  whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown .  its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be  " safe "  ! 
this rather poorly named western series won an emmy for best syndicated program and is certainly an interesting series .  it was produced by republic ,  the studio which did action better than anyone ,  and they put their best into it .  each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west .  a railroad detective named matt clark ,  similar to the later elliot ness with the gangsters of the 1920's and 30's ,  managed to become involved with almost every notorious western outlaw between the middle of the 1800's and wwi .  the series' best asset was jim davis .  tall ,  rugged ,  ruggedly good looking ,  in prime shape ,  with an authentic western accent ,  and great riding skills which made him utterly convincing in the action scenes ,  davis was every inch the western hero .  he was teamed with two lovely and active co-stars ,  mary castle as  " frankie "  during the first season ,  and kristine miller as  " jonesy "  during the second .  each worked well with davis .   what separated this show from its contemporaries and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scenes .  ace action directer william witney directed 30 episodes .  franklin adreon the rest .  both filmed the action with polish .  republic's vast store of stock footage from serials and b's was utilized to give scope .  the level of individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the guest stars brought in to the play the outlaws .  among the really good ones were marie windsor as belle starr ,  lee van cleef as jesse james ,  fess parker as grat dalton ,  jean parker as cattle kate ,  and joe sawyer and slim pickins as butch cassady and  " the smilin' kid "  .  the cream of the western up and comers ,  pickins ,  parker ,  denver pyle ,  james best ,  and richard jaeckel ,  honed their craft .  b veterans with decades of experience under their belts ,  harry woods ,  glenn strange ,  kenneth macdonald ,  earle hodgkins ,  steve darrell ,  and chief yowlachie ,  provided the old leather feel of vintage westerns .   the weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous western outlaws .  by the second season the famous figures were becoming a mite obscure for all by the most dedicated history buff .  nevertheless ,  a few of the later shows were a match for any ,  due to the guest stars .  henry brandon portrayed rustler nate champion ,  and former republic star don barry was outstanding as small-time outlaw milt sharp .   western fans or history buffs will want to see this . 
it's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at regency films  ( and later with fox )  :  cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on  " fatal attraction "  .  .  . voilà !  i don't know how on earth a talented director like ivan reitman got involved ,  unless the pay was just too tempting .  a dateless employee at an architectural design firm in n . y . c .  meets a girl on the subway and asks her out ;  despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant ,  he eventually gets her into bed--only to find out later she's the big apple's resident superhero ,  g-girl .  this distaff superman ,  with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite ,  isn't a fantasy heroine ,  however .  .  . screenwriter don payne has conceived her as a needy ,  possessive ,  vindictive bitch  ( he telegraphs this to us from miles away ,  though uma thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs )  .  this is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by .  our introduction to leading man luke wilson ,  talking with rainn wilson on the train ,  is accompanied by a sour dig at gays  ( it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies' men )  .  after being approached by g-girl's nemesis ,  who wants to zap her powers ,  wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned .  .  . and isn't that better after all ?  thurman's early performances in films like  " henry & june "  and  " jennifer 8 "  showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise ;  her films with quentin tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity ,  but that came at a price  ( the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch )  .  the picture is exceedingly well-produced and shot ,  with expensive-seeming special effects ,  yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario .  it's pushy ,  leering ,  ugly ,  and badly-cast .  bloated ,  frozen-faced wilson can't tell any of his co-workers that he's dating g-girl because she made him swear he'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up his rectum .  i wonder if writer payne actually thought that was hilarious .  .  . or ,  indeed ,  if anyone involved did ?  * from ****
i rented this dvd for two reasons .  a cast of great actors ,  and the director ,  even though robert altman can be hit or miss .  in this case ,  it was a big miss .  altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester .  after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like  " dead again "  ,  i didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey ,  and i hope it didn't ruin his reputation .  robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time oscar winners .  on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one .  duvall was once a great actor in excellent films ,  even though his best performance was not  " tender mercies "  ,  but  " the great santini "  .  this movie was truly a big waste of time .  i give it a 2 out of 10 . 
i have a deep liking for this film despite it appearing deliberately less 'polished' than the other fred and ginger films ,  not to mention the slightly problematic casting of harriet hillard in the lead romantic role .    once again with these films ,  the plot is of a minor consequence - astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor  ( who happens to be a brilliant former hoofer  ( of course !  )  )  and rogers an aspiring performer in a seedy dime-a-dance music hall .  although their relationship is bright and fun to watch ,  they are bogged down by an un-involving main story of hilliard and randolph scott not succeeding in finding any chemistry between them .    although it was a last minute decision ,  hilliard was rather miscast in this as she doesn't have the screen presence to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and likable throughout .  the film may have benefited in promoting lucille ball's wise-cracking worldy brassy character to a larger role as she simply shined in every small scene ,  and would have made a great helen broderick-type side-kick to rogers in this kind of bright film  ( see 'stage door' ,  made the following year ,  for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses )  .  that scott's one-dimensional neanderthal character eventually falls in love with hilliard's is even harder to believe than astaire being in the navy !    now onto the important part ,  the singing and dancing :  nothing more can be said about  " let's face the music and dance "  other than it is brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and i often finish watching that scene with tears in my eyes .  however other songs in the film deserve some recognition as well ;   " i'm putting all my eggs in one basket "  is a lovely example of the comedic instincts of astaire and rogers ,  and almost pokes fun at their reputation of bursting into spontaneous ,  perfectly synchronized dancing .  other highlights are  " i'd rather lead the band "  and  " let yourself go "  which show how these two talents could perform as brilliantly alone as together .  i nearly forgot to mention that this is one of the few  ( if not the only )  time we see astaire brilliantly play on the piano ;  it seems this man's talents were endless !   overall ,  i actually prefer this to 'top hat' and 'swing time'  ( although only just )  ,  as it is more earthy and performed so enthusiastically by all involved ,  it is hard to dislike the fun factor . 
i watched the malayalam movie  " boeing boeing "  made in 1985  ( which in turn is probably inspired by an english movie of same name )  long back .  the basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way ,  the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal hindi movies  ( probably the director did this to suit the taste of hindi audience )  .  .  .    i haven't seen the english original .  but had really enjoyed the malayalam film  ( made by priyadarshan himself ) which was a side splitting comedy ,  back then .  of course the acting by mohanlal , mukesh and sukumari  ( who did the cook's role )  was so natural and spontaneous .   probably ,  i am too smitten by the malayalam film that i cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its hindi remake .  but i still feel that akshay kumar and john abraham have overacted .  paresh rawal has done a decent job - but doesn't reach anywhere near sukumari .   but all in all its ok ,  if one compares it to other recent hindi comedy movies . 
i gave this movie a very fair chance ,  and it betrayed me .  this is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist bogdanavich  ( who did way better with targets )  gets  " great performances "  out of a ton of hams in their debuts .  lots of teenage sex clichés come out of this movie ,  such as doing the teacher's wife ,  impotence ,  doing the ugly prostitute ( which is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt ,  not that things were really going anywhere anyway )  and skinny dipping .   i suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense ,  to me ,  it was just annoying .  i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess . 
vincent price's follow-up to house of wax  ( 1953 )  ,  the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon ,  similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman .  though a remake ,  the former  ( shot in technicolor )  remains the superior effort ;  that said ,  apart from some resistible comic relief ,  the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry  ( it was another 3-d showcase )  and occasional narrative shortcomings  ( whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head ?  )  ,  this offers more than enough grand guignol-type thrills and overall camp value  ( price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating 'missing' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius )  to stand on its own two feet .  incidentally ,  director brahm's involvement here proves no mere coincidence  since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles  ( both starring laird cregar )  he had previously helmed i . e .  the lodger  ( 1944 )  and hangover square  ( 1945 )  .  the young leads are played by mary murphy  ( as price's ingénue assistant )  and patrick o'neal  ( as her police detective boyfriend  curiously enough ,  he would himself take the lead in a similar piece ,  chamber of horrors [1966] ,  which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one )  .  an interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique ,  fingerprinting ,  which is crucial in bringing about price's downfall  ( in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax ) though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run !  watching the star in a made-to-measure role ,  the film emerges a good deal of fun  particularly at a compact 73 minutes . 
director fred schepisi ( roxanne )  directs this well intentioned ,  but inferior comedy about albert einstein ( matthau )  trying to hook his scientific niece ( ryan )  up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950's .  to get ryan to like robbins ,  einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist .  the idea is cute ,  but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue .  tim robbins ,  meg ryan ,  and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat ,  but are unable to rescue the film .  its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie .  i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan . 
the character of tarzan has been subjected to so many clichés ,  and so many bad interpretations ,  that those who are hoping for a different kind of version  ( people like me ,  i mean ,  who liked the tarzan books as a kid and have always wished for a movie version that followed the books just a little )  ought to know how the recent renditions stack up .  some of the imdb reviews address this point ,  but here's my $ . 02  i am aware of only two--count 'em--cinema depictions of tarzan ,  namely greystoke with christopher lambert and the disney animated version ,  that try to depict edgar rice burrough's rather interesting character  ( the son of a marooned english noble couple ,  picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves ,  and who becomes  " lord of the jungle "  because of his superior human intellect before making it back to england and claiming his other identity )  rather than the usual hollywood jungle-man whose origin remains obscure and whose trademarks are his famous yell ,  his mysterious inability to speak proper english despite long exposure to people who know the language ,  his habit of swinging on vines ,  his strength ,  heroism ,  etc .  about the only thing these two characters have in common are the name tarzan and the fact that they both have a wife named jane .  ron ely's tv version is something of a compromise :  like burroughs' character ,  he speaks good english and is adept and suave in both cultures in a sort of jamesbondish way ,  but he's no lord greystoke and there's no jane .   well ,  this film is in a third category of tarzan films ,  and i hope it remains a category of one because it's awful .  this category uses the character as a vehicle for ,  of all things ,  soft porn .  jane ,  played by legendarily bad actress bo derek is in africa looking for her dad the absent-minded professor who is combing the jungle looking for something which is never specified .  though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time ,  she finds him effortlessly .  richard harris as the dad is the best thing here ;  he sees the film is stupid so he has fun overacting and hamming in a way that reminds me of peter o'toole's deliberately silly performance in what's new pussycat .  dad explains the legend of tarzan  (  " some sort of ghost or spirit "  he says--either a steal from ,  or an inartistic attempt at homage to ,  king kong )  to his daughter ,  who is at this point unfamiliar with the ape-man .  shortly afterward ,  we hear the infamous cliché of the tarzan yell .  dad dies ,  which oddly doesn't seem to faze his devoted daughter very much .  and then .  .  .  .  .   then tarzan appears ,  but says nothing .  indeed ,  he says nothing during the entire film .  he and jane fall in love ,  and they romp around wearing almost nothing as she recites doggerel love-poetry off-screen .  the end .  that's the plot .    well ,  not exactly ;  there's also a scene where tarzan wrestles unrealistically with a boa constrictor--a most unusual boa ,  since it's the only poisonous one ever seen .  jane treats the bite with the aid of a chimp who helps by wringing out the garment she tears off to bind the wound with  ( i'm not making this up !  )  ,  and this is only one of many excuses for her to take her clothes off .   i always like to conclude a review by saying something positive ,  but this time it's hard .  let's see .  .  .  well ,  it's unfair to criticize this film for featuring an orangutan ,  even though we all know orangutans don't live in africa ;  after all ,  the classic tarzan movies all used indian elephants ,  did they not ?  also ,  you have to admit that bo derek is pretty in face and form .   ( but in that case why the hell didn't she just make a career as an art model ?  what does it say about a movie when it becomes plain boring to look at a pretty woman ?  i actually haven't decided whether it's a positive or a negative that they never showed her crotch .  )  but now i realize :  try as i may ,  i can't end on a positive note .    see this film if you're a bad film buff .  i'm outa here . 
i found the fbi story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my new years day holiday viewing .  its drama and action-packed episodes were thrilling .  the hardesty character was well drawn and admirable .  overall the photography ,  script and direction was perfectly creditable .  rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda ,  as some might ,  i enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime .  again ,  the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to his  ( arguably )  important work ,  i did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one . 
it's a little disconcerting to have a character named gig young in a movie .  .  . played by gig young .  but this film is where gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name .   i'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that i really enjoyed this film ,  mainly because of the vibrant performance of barbara stanwyck as fiona .  she was funny ,  angry ,  vulnerable ,  caring ,  and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the lusitania ,  and whose father was later killed during woar war i .    as the  " man "  of the house ,  fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father's will which would therefore allow a donald trump type named charles barclay to get the family home .  but fiona's keeping a secret as to why she hates barclay so much .  geraldine fitzgerald is the middle ,  flirty sister ,  who is married to an englishman but craves her youngest sister's boyfriend  ( gig young )  .   if you're a stanwyck fan ,  this is a no miss . 
i loved good times with the rest of many of you .  i love reading intelligent and insightful commentary .  the writers on this show were fantastic and the actors were beyond talented .  to answer strawberry22  ( the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary )  .  .  . what happened was that james was killed in an accident  ( i believe i remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident )  and it was the saddest episode  ( when it first aired and i was a tiny thing .  .  . it was so sad to me .  .  )  .   florida and the children actually get out of the projects and even become neighbors with willona  ( wilnona )  and that is how the very last show ended .   all of the children achieved their dreams and found opportunity in each of their dreams .  it was a wonderful ending and i cried because i was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that i actually believed in their fate .  i hope that this kind of ending rings true in actually for many .   a great show and many other great shows followed including benson and the jeffersons .  this was an awesome period for african-american television and the best writers were awesome at that time .  tv land is awesome for the memories and i just love it because i cannot stand the junk that we are watching today .  somebody .  .  . bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly .  .  . your intelligent viewers are a dying breed out here and we need better material .   love ,  a tv land original sitcom junkie of the 70s and 80s  ( as they sing in  " all in the family "  .  .  . those were the days .  .  .  .  .  . 
i simply can't get over how brilliant the pairing of walter matthau and jack lemmon is .  it's like the movie doesn't even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two .   lemmon had already been in several well-known films like mr .  roberts and the apartment and matthau was fresh off his oscar win for the fortune cookie  ( another billy wilder film also with lemmon )  .  that particular movie wasn't as great as this one because the story couldn't sustain such a long running time  ( i think it was almost 2 hours )  .  however ,  this goes by at a brisk hour and a half ,  even though the introduction of the events leading up to lemmon ending up at matthau's apartment is a tad long  ( so was this sentence )  .  that's a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time .   i have already written a comment about how the follow-up to this film sucked and i won't go deeper into that .  the reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of american movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion .  there are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldn't even get a  " well ,  i never .  .  .  "  out of the most prudish person out there .  it is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didn't work because you had matthau and lemmon say quite a few f-words and that just doesn't fit them .   of course ,  now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this .  i think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is john fiedler .  edelman died recently .  so there you have it .  simply one of the best comedies and films ever .   add :  i have just learned recently that john fiedler has died so to all the fans of him i am deeply sorry .  i didn't mean any disrespect and i will try to be more careful of what i am blah blah blahing next time . 
this utterly dull ,  senseless ,  pointless ,  spiritless ,  and dumb movie isn't the final proof that the world can forget about danny boyle and his post- " trainspotting "  movies :   " the beach "  already took care of that .  what this low-budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs ,  booze ,  ego ,  self-delusion ,  bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once-promising director's quick demise .   the premise is absurd :  two losers  ( ecclestone and some bimbo jenna g - a rapper ,  likely )  meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit-making duo - which they become .  a friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video-camera by which he films them in  " action "  ,  and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage .  now ,  i know that the uk in recent years has put out incredible junk ,  but this is ridiculous ;  the music makes oasis seem like the beatles .  during the studio recordings ,  the duo - strumpet - change lyrics in every take and ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it ,  and quite absurdly they do take it .  not only is the music total and utter trash ,  but its  " performers "  are anti-social ;  these newcomers are supposed to be calling the shots .  it's just too dumb .  it's plain awful .   the dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere ,  and this rags-to-bitches story has no point and makes no sense .  it often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs .  danny boyle is a complete idiot .  this little piece of trash is so bad it's embarrassing to watch .  ecclestone's i . q .  also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense .  whoever financed this £1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners . 
it's not just that this is a bad movie ;  it's not only that four of the  " best "  mexican movie makers are in this film ;  and it's not only that the script is terrible .  it's just that .  .  . this movie sucks .  .  . big time .  this people are wasting money in terrible scripts .  it's supposed to make a criticism about mexican society but we're fed up with this kind of films .  is bad language supposed to be funny ?  i don't get it .  mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movies are going to continue playing  ( and being written and produced )  .   please ,  don't think this kind of movies are well received in mexico :  we hate them and they don't reflect us . 
 " the college girl murders "  is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace  and generally my first real acquaintance with  " krimi "  films in general  and i can say that i'm moderately impressed .  this stuff is really entertaining ,  although i never would have expected it to be so  goofy !  the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot ,  with a healthy dose of humor ,  flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings .  there's some james bond type of evil mastermind  who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison .  there's also a villainous monk with a whip ,  dressed like a communist kkk member ,  getting rid of the leftover characters ,  like overly curious teachers and such ,  as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach .  seriously ,  if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy ,  i would have purchased a whole collection of them already .  the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end ,  and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow ,  but i don't care because it was sublime entertainment .  even the funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time .  it's like a variant on the italian giallo ,  but with slapstick elements . 
 " her cardboard lover "  is norma shearer's last movie .  she quit the movies and ,  i think ,  joined the board of directors at mgm .  that was a good move on her part .   " her cardboard lover "  was talky and boring in parts .  it was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat .    the story was a good idea about a wealthy woman  ( norma shearer )  hiring a man  ( robert taylor )  to make her playboy fiancee  ( george sanders ) jealous .  i am surprised that the director ,  george cukor ,  did not cut many of the talky scenes between ms .  shearer and mr .  taylor .  mr .  cukor served ms .  shearer well in  " the women "  but not in this movie .    the best performance in the movie was given by robert taylor .  during mr .  taylor's career ,  he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and  " when ladies meet "  in 1941 .  in 1942 ,  he gave his best comedy performance in  " her cardboard lover "  and ,  up to then ,  his best dramatic performance in  " johnny eager .  "  he had a busy year .  i think of all the actors at mgm ,  mr .  taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot .  also ,  mgm gave mr .  taylor all types of movies to make - most of them were successful .  that is why mgm kept him for 25 years .    mr .  george sanders was very good as a socialite heel .  he played a similar role eight years later in  " all about eve "  for which he won an oscar for a supporting role .  as for ms .  shearer ,  this was one of her worst performances ,  she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy .  it is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939 ,   " the women "  ,  and gave her best performance .  it was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in  " her cardboard lover .  "  also ,  it didn't help that some of her clothes were awful .   too bad she and mr .  taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together ,  the superb  " escape "  .  the same comments about this movie can be said of another movie ,   " personal property "  that mr .  taylor made in 1937 with jean harlow .  it was too talky ,  boring ,  and the actress looked old .  ms .  harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor ,  so in 1937 ,  she died at age 26 .  what a waste !  she was becoming a good actress and getting better roles . 
this movie was bad .  this movie was horrible .  the acting was bad .  the setting was unrealistic .  the story was absurd :  a comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night .  most of the world's population decided to watch this comet .  then ,  the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation .  people's clothes are still intact ,  there are plants which are still alive ,  but the people were turned to dust .  no bones ,  nothing .  thats ridiculous .  how can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact ?   even better ,  the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters .  their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child .  the insane clown posse scare me more .  .  . and they're supposed to look stupid .   then there were the survivors .  people who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death .  how can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks ?   equally insulting is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie ,  or the 80's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television .   the stupidest part of the movie ,  however ,  are the characters it focuses on :  two valley girls and chakotay from star trek :  voyager .  these three characters were totally unrealistic .  who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere ?  there were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie ,  and most of them were dreams .  in between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes south park seem intelligent .  the silence in between the elementary dialog was painful .  i could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of cheetos .  don't see this movie ,  ever . 
i hate this programme :  not only is the very concept ludicrous ,  but it tries so hard to be feasible  ( something that was left out of similar  " i confess "  ending programmes like ,  muder :  she wrote )  .   sigh .  why is it that the writers can't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court ?   come on :  after x-amount of years of the cases being unsolved ,  why must every suspect ,  every episode *confess*  ( damn it !  )  to a murder which would otherwise go unsolved ?   i bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen :   " aw ,  shucks ,  officer ,  you're a bright one - i guess if you've uncovered enough to convince yourself i did it ,  i may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court .  what can i say ?  it's a fair cop .  "   absolute dog s**t and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of i . q . 
i saw this a couple of nights back ,  not expecting too much and unsurprisingly it didn't deliver anything too exciting .  the plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters  ( v-san ,  for vampire sanitation )  ,  going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people ,  is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace .  unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film ,  leaving something behind that ,  though vacantly watchable ,  is quite laughably bad .  i don't expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the sci fi channel and at least this wasn't one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about ,  but it was still pretty bad ,  mostly due to the writing and acting ,  but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music .  when the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did ok ,  but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness .  i would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music ,  which was a serious miscalculation ,  turning things from cheesy to lamely comical .  of the acting ,  dominic zamprogna was ok but bland as the nominal hero ,  whilst leanne adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and aaron pearl played another member who wasn't well written or interesting enough to make an impression .  though she didn't seem that good at the acting lark natassia malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others ,  and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at .  the only serious name in the cast is michael ironside and he is underused though he does nicely ,  pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional .  he seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining .  the effects are ok on the whole ,  they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction tv show ,  and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well .  things move along nicely ,  and i almost feel harsh rating this film badly ,  but then i remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy ,  which i don't think it is ,  then it simply doesn't succeed .  too much is lame ,  daft ,  unconvincing ,  its an ok effort i guess but it didn't appeal to me .  only give it a go if you really dig sci fi trash or unintended chuckles i'd say . 
henry thomas was  " great "  .  his character held my attention .  i was so  " into "  the story that i forgot it wasn't real .  i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was .  the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character .  the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring .  i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head ,  in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself . 
because that is the only way you won't think this film is a total waste of time and money .  a remake of  " heaven can wait "  ,   ( which was at least worth watching )  is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy .  it is more a vehicle to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen .  especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old ,  fat ,  rich ,  dead man but are shown coming from rock himself .  as he insults blacks and whites the chemistry is all wrong .  the movie is not funny ,  poorly shot the acting is weak at best .  go rent  " heaven can wait "  and a live rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game . 
i have been a hindi movie buff since the age of 4 but never in my life have a watched such a moving and impacting movie ,  especially as a hindi film .  in the past several years ,  i had stopped watching contemporary hindi movies and reverted to watching the classics  ( teesri kasam ,  mere huzoor ,  madhumati ,  mother india ,  sholay ,  etc .  )  but this movie changed everything .  it is one of the best movies i have ever seen .  i found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation indian woman growing up in america .  it helped me to understand my own family history ,  which was always something very abstract to me .  but ,  to  " see "  it ,  feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that indian people endured .  the film helped to put many things into perspective for me ,  especially considering the current world events .  i never thought that a movie could change the way i think like this before .  .  .  it did .  the plot is fantastic ,  the acting superb and the direction is flawless .  two thumbs up ! 
the premise of the film is that thomas archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized -- and he is given a chance at revenge when  ( after post traumatic stress disorder therapy )  ,  he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit .  he is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution :  drills ,  bats ,  nails ,  sledgehammers ,  torches ,  whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being .   we go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that the man archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime .  the two then create an uncomfortable alliance ;  who put them in this situation and why .   well ,  when all is said and done ,  we don't really care .  .  . 
scifi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately  ( such as minotaur or dog soldiers )  .  grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic beowulf ,  however ,  it deviates so much  ( and offers so little in comparison )  that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it 'some shitty christopher lambert movie' .  i wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown hollywood production ,  but i did however expect the 'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story  ( even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots )  .   did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing  ( did any research go into this ?  )  .  obviously not ,  as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that beowulf and his crew  ( save for mullet boy )  are wearing .  one major problem i have though was with the very look of grendelif beowulf is supposed to wrestle him ,  shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons ?  grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way  in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script ;  for example :  grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by beowulf  not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs !  and grendel's motherdid they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds ?  and honestly ,  what the hell was with that mullet ?    if you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic . don't ,  as there really isn't one  ( other than character names )  .  the only way i could recommend this film is if you liked the movie druids  ( directed by jacques dorfmann )   although i don't recommend watching either . 
the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student .  although in the previous film olivia newton st .  john's foreign speech pattern is not explained ,  it's explained here caulfield is her cousin .  what's conn still doing in school ,  i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she's a beautician .   caulfield's a smart kid ,  so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd .  and that's especially bad when zmed's girl friend decides she likes caulfield .  but being a nerd just isn't going to cut it .   that's when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act .  he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride .  he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face .  if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards ,  caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's outfitted .   grease 2 introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed .  if you saw the first grease film ,  a much better film ,  than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out .   in addition to conn ,  eve arden ,  sid caesar ,  and dody goodman ,  all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles .  the music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original .   it's not that grease 2 is bad ,  it's just not all that great . 
a struggling actor finds the best way to break into hollywood is to start knocking off the competition .  but what makes break a leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling  ( and not so )  la actor .  it brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit .  it's also got a polished look and very adept direction under monika mitchell .  break a leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn't compromise its production values at any level .  the writing is tight ,  the dialogue first rate .  cassini is an actor's actor ,  and the role really shows off his talents .  the climactic scene between him and rene garcia is an instant classic ,  and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scenes of all time .  i saw it at an advanced screening ,  and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards . 
i'm not a stage purist .  a movie could have been made of this play ,  and it would almost necessarily require changes .  .  .  comme ci ,  comme ca .  but the modest conceits of this material are lost or misunderstood by the movie's creators who are in full-on  " shallow blockbuster "  mode .  it would be hard to imagine a worse director .  perhaps only josh logan & jack warner could have ruined this in the same way attenborough did .   onstage a chorus line was a triumph of workshopping as a production method .  dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stage-career experiences  ( very 70s !  )  .  then bennett and hamlisch took some time ,  handed them a song and cast them as themselves .   .  .  . astonishing !  unbelievably modern .  the 'story'of acl is  ( in turn )  about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of ,  because the play doesn't matter .  it was meta before the idea was invented ,  25 years before adaptation noodled with a similar idea .  acl was also another in a reductivist trend that is still alive ,  & which is a hallmark of modern creativity :  that technique itself is compelling .  .  .  that there's more drama in an average person's life than you could ever synthesize with invented characters .  what a gracious idea .  the stage play had one performance area  ( an empty stage )  and three different ways to alter the backdrop ,  to alleviate visual tedium ,  not to keep viewers distracted .  the space recedes and the actors stories are spotlighted .  it worked just fine .  that was the point .  all these ideas are trampled or bastardized .  set-wise ,  there wasn't one ,  and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final bows ,  in which the exhilarating  " one "  is finally ,  powerfully ,  performed in full  ( gold )  top hats and tails ,  with moves we recognize because we've watched them in practice sessions .  the pent-up anxiety of the play is released --- and audiences went nuts .    after grampa manhandles this ,  it's like a mushed ,  strangled bird .  he clearly has the earlier ,  respected all that jazz  ( and fosse's stage piece dancin' )  in mind as he makes his choices .  hamlisch's score was edgy & interesting for it's time ,  but time has not been kind to it .  it's as schmaltzy as  " jazz hands .  "  and that's before attenborough ever touches it .  he's remarkable at finding whatever good was left ,  and mangling it .    a simple question might have helped attenborough while filming this ,   " could i bear spending even a few minutes with people like these ?  "  a major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater  ( pivotal by it's absence in theater )  would be addressed in the film format .  there's never been a more  " frontal "  play .  the answer they came up with was ,   " i'm sorry .  .  what was the question ?  "  the cast has been augmented from a manageable number of unique narratives ,  to a crowd suffocating each other and the audience ,  and blending their grating selves together .  i was well past my annoyance threshold when that annoying little runt swings across the stage on a rope ,  clowning at the  ( absent )  audience .  the play made you understand theater people .  this movie just makes you want to choke them .   perhaps broadways annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience  ( les miz ,  miss saigon )  instead of relating to other characters started here .  but the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie .    a chorus line is pure schlock . 
the movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become .  it has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person .  no character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical indian movies and no character is 100% bad rather all are just different .  the movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions ,  drama and entertainment .  for the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions .  i would recommend all to see the movie .  madhavi sharma is a journalist who covers those hip-shaking parties of bollywood for the page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper .  but this is not all ,  then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children ,  how brutally her voice is suppressed .  even she is fired from the job .  then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do page 3 again .  not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie .  i would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie .  please do not afford to miss it . 
i loved the first little mermaid .  i know the songs ,  i love the characters and i love the story .  i can't say anything like that about the little mermaid ii :  return to the sea .  it was terrible .  let's start with the story .  the plot was a reversed copy of the first movie .  same situations ,  except in reverse !  ariel wanted to live on land ,  her daughter melody  ( creative name )  wants to live in the sea .  ariel was tricked by ursula ,  melody is tricked by ursula's sister ,  morgana .  ursula had a sister ?  ?  not sure where that came from .  besides being a strange copy of the first movie ,  this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie .  now the characters :  1 .  ariel- what happened to her ?  ?  !  !  no longer the spunky ,  headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie ,  she has now  " grown up "  and her personality went down the drain .  her singing voice wasn't as strong either ,  due to either jodi benson being a lot older ,  or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted .  2 .  prince eric- while he didn't have a lot of personality in the first movie ,  like all disney princes ,  somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic .  to top it off ,  he just can't seem to defend himself ,  and ariel becomes the tough one of the two .  3 .  sebastian- say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie ,  because a whiny ,  aggravating little crab just took his place .  he also had no good songs in this movie .  you can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible  " under the sea "  and  " kiss the girl "  from the first movie ,  and it is very sad .  4 .  flounder- they destroyed him !  !  he is not cute anymore ,  his voice is terrible ,  and he has kids now ?  ?  who's the mother ?  ?  ?  5 .  morgana- she appears to be ursula's sister out for revenge against her mother ,  who always picked ursula over her .  so she plans to get king triton's trident to become the new ruler of the sea .  sound familiar ?  anyway ,  she's a very cliché villain and falls short of ursula's greatness as a villain .  she epically fails at witchcraft ,  she's not very tough ,  and not threatening at all .  6 . melody- ariel and eric's daughter .  ironic name because she ,  unlike ariel ,  can't sing .  her voice is annoying ,  her friends  ( a walrus and a penguin ?  ?  really ?  !  )  are not funny or likable ,  and she's exactly the same as ariel ,  in reverse and not as likable .  skip this one .  don't watch any disney sequel except for lion king 2 .  this movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories .  i will look back at this movie and just laugh . 
alone in the dark is one bad movie and tied with deuce bigalow for worst movie of the year .  i wish that was all i had to say but of course the imdb stipulates a word count and all that .   i'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie .  a low budget dreck like red zone cuba ,  monster a go go and manos .  or a huge budget disgrace like gigli ,  superbabies or this guff .  you see movies like monster a go go and manos happen because the director hasn't a clue .  movies like this happen because the director is a stupid ,  money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience .   it's more shocking when you consider that uwe boll  ( the mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt )  has created something that only happens once in a blue moon .  the really terribly bad horror film .  everything about it is a mess .  cheesy cgi ,  bad plot ,  insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack .   alone in the dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody .  woo hoo !  review over .  give me a bud ,  roll on 2006 and may i never speak of this again .   don't watch this film . 
this is something new .   there's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it .   a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator ,  mentally unstable ,  new hitler ,  etc .  without repercussion from the governments side  ( like ,  say ,  silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods )  .  oh ,  and they still claim that they are being suppressed ,  of course .   see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals  ( how much more stupid can you get ?  ?   )  .   and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace ,  holding the constitution in their hands ,  and reinstall their elected government .   this sounds like a hollywood fairytale ,  but it happened for real ,  against the explicit wishes of the usa .  the documentary is a historical masterpiece ,  shot from the center of the action ,  acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup :  the good ,  democratic ,  freedom loving ,  benevolent usa  ( who still channel large amounts of money to chavez' political opponents )  .   also highly entertaining and exciting .  10 points . 
this is a really fun ,  breezy ,  light hearted romantic comedy .  you cannot go wrong with meg ryan's cute perkiness combined with albert einstein's genius .  normally ,  i'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people ,  now deceased and not able to defend themselves ,  but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one .   it's the 1950's .  .  . princeton ,  new jersey in the spring .  the story revolves around a pretty ,  young ,  scatter brained mathematician ,  catherine  ( meg ryan )  ,  who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk ,  a behavioral researcher named james ,  merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children .  however ,  it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed  ( tim robbins )  .  as she doesn't think ed is intelligent enough ,  her uncle ,  none other than albert einstein ,  plays match maker ,  assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies ,  all theoretical physicists .  uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart ,  so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist .  .  . naturally with amusing results .   walter matthau is his usual hilarious self ,  and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively .  with his three professorial buddies ,  kurt ,  nathan ,  and boris ,  a lot of laughs ensue .  the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one  ( outrageous )  step further .  if you suspend all logic ,  you can almost imagine this silly story happening !   it might not be rocket science  ( despite its main character )  but it is a wonderful sweet ,  refreshing movie .  one of the best of the comedy romance genre . 
i regret every single second of the time i lost while watching this movie ,  really .  unhappily ,  i always find it hard to switch off a movie once i started watching it .  especially ,  when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic .  i think that this is one of those movies every movie-lover should have watched at least one time ,  so that was why i watched it .  don't get me wrong ,  i like humphrey bogart and his wife lauren bacall both as a couple and as actors ,  but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion .  no really good plot ,  neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story .  well ,  not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres .  only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether 'bogey' and bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another .  i think  " to have and have not "  is very overrated and bogart was in many better films during the 1940s . 
i saw this at  " dances with films "  ,  and it was awesome .  i really felt for jake .  talk about adding insult to injury !  not only are your parents getting divorced ,  but there's a monster after you .    it was both heartfelt and scary -- there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright .  it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film ,  except that the story was actually good .   and that's what separated  " jake's closet "  from the usual indy film pabulum -- an excellent script with compelling characters .  also ,  by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama ,  the movie gets the best out of both genres ,  and avoids the clichés of both .   if it's not coming out in theaters ,  definitely get the dvd . 
surely one of the most ill-advised remakes of a classic in film history – especially since the promise of its tag-line ,  “the most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time” ,  isn’t even properly exploited !  although this film was regularly shown on tv in my neck of the woods since my childhood days ,  its notoriety  ( for awfulness not erotic content ,  mind you )  kept me away from it until now – and i only relented because i have recently enjoyed bo derek’s previous film ,  10  ( 1979 )  ,  and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the christmas period .   lead actress/producer bo derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl-ish sexual innocent  ( witness the inept banana scene )  and ,  as was to be expected ,  she is made to get her clothes off a few times but ,  as welcome as these scenes were ,  she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here ;  richard harris ,  then ,  chews the scenery incessantly as jane’s obsessed explorer father ,  but john philip law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in jane herself ;  newcomer miles o’keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie ,  is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel  ( which is probably lifted from johnny weissmuller anyway !  )  and ,  furthermore ,  is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film’s second half !  ;  for the record ,  he later starred in two ator movies  ( or would-be conan imitators )  for joe d’amato and the king arthur-era set ,  sword of the valiant  ( 1984 )  .   when still an actor ,  director john derek  ( who also serves as his own cinematographer here )  had worked with some good film-makers  ( cecil b .  de mille ,  william dieterle and robert rossen )  and a few great ones  ( otto preminger ,  nicholas ray and don siegel )  but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability :  appallingly pretentious at times  ( witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence )  with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions ;  this was derek’s seventh film as a director  ( and his second of four with wife bo )  and ,  eventually ,  he would only get to make two more .   the film’s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the tarzan legend was tackled once more on film – in greystoke :  the legend of tarzan ,  lord of the apes  ( which ,  surprisingly enough ,  i haven’t watched myself yet )  – a mere three years later !  !  nominated for six razzie awards  ( including john derek ,  richard harris and miles o’keeffe )  and winning one for bo derek herself ,  tarzan ,  the ape man was co-written by gary goddard ,  the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a  ( this time animated )  heroic figure ,  master of the universe  ( 1987 )  which i will be revisiting presently as well  ( yay )  !  despite a charming closing credit sequence showing tarzan and jane playing with around with an orang-utan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion ,  any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting bo completely white and ,  fatally ,  john derek’s clear disinterest in the character of tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own self-titled movie !  ! 
it aired on tv yesterday ,  so i decided to check it out .  this was one of the last bruce timm/paul dini dtv projects related to their old 1992 batman the animated series ,  after that jeff matsuda came along and re-imagined batman with his new the batman series ,  but anyway ,  the story of this new batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as batwoman ,  however batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods ,  and also in the meantime take down the pengiun and ruphert thorn who both are secretly working with carlton duquesne ( who's having family troubles )  and another villain ( which is later revealed in the movie )  on a weapons smuggling operation , they also put a bounty on the batwoman .  the question is :  who is this mysterious batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one ?  it's up to batman to solve this mystery and stop penguin's latest operation .  for an animated movie ,  it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone ,  which is good .  another plus was the complete redesign of the penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated mob boss we're used to seeing in the comics ,  unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from tim burton vision of pengium ( sewer rat and circus freak )  .  even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't derail the movie like say ,  batman forever .  the voice acting is standard quality for these direct-to-video projects ( if only batman :  mask of phantasm took this route )  ,  kevin conroy still shines as batman/bruce wayne .  and like i said despite running for some very short 80 minutes ,  it manages to make a pretty good ( and complex )  storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action .  there are a few downsides ,  however ,  nightwing is nowhere to be seen ,  and i'm sure barbara gordon and bruce wayne don't click as a couple ,  even though is just referenced ,  tim drake ( aka robin )  does very little in the movie and to be quite frank ,  i was never a big fan of paul dini and bruce timm's batman character design ( especially in their batman shows post-btas )  ,  this the new adventures of batman and robin ,  well ,  it kinda makes batman look fat then rather a well-built bulked up individual ( kinda like the jeff matsuda character model from the batman )  .  bruce wayne seems a bit awkward ,  those blue eyes make him look more like clark kent then bruce ( though it's true they do look very much alike )  .  another downside is rupert throne ( no explanation as to why he is in this deal ,  but it's safe to say he's has goons and what's a cut of the deal )  which does very little more then hang out with the penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone ( count how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised .  overall ,  a good batman animated movie ,  worth at least a rental . 
this movie was way over-hyped .  a lot of the viewers ,  who thought this was  " amazing "  must have been into the old school movies ,  cause the whole movie is set in the past .  at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past ,  so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass ,  but it just going .  basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past ,  and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie ,  even with special effects .  you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with .  there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did ,  so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying  " it's the greatest movie ever done "  .  it's just crap on a stick .  it also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy .  i don't understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced ,  and i also don't understand how actors/actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this .  it's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print .  .  .  " it will all be done on a computer "  .  this was a movie that should have been on a movie network ,  because nothing about this movie was revolutionary .  i'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this .  whatever you do ,  don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow . 
a top notch columbo from beginning to end .  i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer ,  ruth gordon .   as an avid columbo fan ,  i can't recall another one in which he doesn't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes .  in this one ,  as he's trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the  " message "  that the nephew left behind ,  it finally dawns on him .   the music in this episode is very good as well ,  as it is in many of other ones . 
i really liked batman :  dead end ,  i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film .  this trailer didn't quite give me the same impression .  the story line ,  or potential story line ,  was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show .   first ,  michael o'hearn is not that good a superman .  i actually thought he ,  in his brief appearance ,  made a decent clark kent .  sorry ,  i just don't think of superman as being that buff .  the suit kent wore masked his size .  batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman .  supes is toned no doubt but not bulk .  anyway ,  i didn't care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy .  now this may not be just o'hearn's fault ,  collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction .   second ,  the special effects for flying were cheezy .  superman flies through the sky .  if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground ,  with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him .  i don't think there were any full body shots of superman flying .  evidently the harness and rigging supporting o'hearn must have been located on his lower torso .   all in all it was a good trailer .  i'd probably pay to see a film ,  if ever made ,  and would be sure to catch it on television .  the story line ,  an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries ,  superman jealous of lois's attraction to wayne ,  lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman & superman is a good one .  i'm sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company ,  even o'hearn could deliver a decent film .  certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately . 
don't even ask me why i watched this !  the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel .   :  )  it's too terrible for words ,  the movie that is ,  not the bronchitis .  the acting is deplorable ,  richard grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy ,  gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops .  nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film .  the script is dismal ,  peppered with clichéd lines ,   " are you ready ,  pardner ?  "  purrs richard grieco to every single one of his victims .  dire .  avoid . 
when i saw the previews for this movie ,  i didn't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie .  but wow ,  this movie was absolutely awful .  and that's being generous .   first of all ,  the casting for the movie was terrible .  you feel no sympathy  ( or for that matter any morbid feeling )  for the characters .  the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god-awful thing to end .   secondly ,  there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever .  can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming  " pancakes !  !  !  "  at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves i've never seen before ,  and even further biting the guy who has the virus ?  why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy ,  and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him ?  i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud ,   " where the hell did that come from ?  "   i just simply couldn't believe what i had seen .  i really thought i had seen some bad movies ,  but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all .  this movie made me want to puke and then puke again .  then blow my brains out .   please ,  save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive .  watching grass grow ,  perhaps ,  is a proper alternative . 
i'm feeling a little protective of this film because it was my introduction to the u . n . c . l . e . -verse .  the year was 1972 ,  and i . t . v .  ran all eight features in one bumper run  (  followed by re-runs of 'the persuaders' starring tony curtis and roger moore  )  on saturday evenings .  'the karate killers' was chosen to open the season .  it commenced with a cool action sequence as solo and kuryakin's sports car got attacked by a squadron of thrush mini-copters .  i was a fan for life from that moment on .   after the main credits  (  nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action footage  )  we go to the laboratory of dr . simon true  (  jim boles  )  ,  inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater .  true's wife amanda  (  joan crawford  )  has been having an affair with thrush agent randolph  (  herbert lom  )  .  a ruthless fellow indeed ,  he kills both the doctor and his wife ,  before hunting for the formula .  true has prepared for the event - he has divided it into five segments ,  each written on a photograph of himself ,  and sent it to his five daughters ,  all of whom are scattered throughout the world .   solo and kuryakin set out to get the formula first ,  leading to a string of episodes in different locations ,  and cameos from the likes of telly savalas  (  as a tight-fisted italian count  )  ,  terry-thomas ,  and curt jurgens .  one of dr . true's daughters - sandy  (  kim darby  )  - accompanies the u . n . c . l . e .  boys on their global quest .   having assembled the formula ,  thrush turns up and makes them hand it over ,  before whisking them off to their secret base at the north pole .  .  .   of all the u . n . c . l . e .  feature films ,  this is the one i feel should have been produced specially for the cinema .  it hurts by being a television product ,  albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual .  no location filming was done ,  and the various segments come across as repetitive ,  usually culminating in a scrap between u . n . c . l . e .  and thrush .  of the cast ,  joan crawford is memorably hammy in her small role ,  and curt jurgens badly miscast as a sugar daddy .  as a london bobby ,  terry-thomas is as delightful as ever ,  and herbert lom good as the chief villain .  kim darby grates though as 'sandy' .  she should have been told to stay at home .   what is surprising about this is that it manages to be more amusing and entertaining than many official cinema releases of the time ,  including 'in like flint' ,  'casino royale' and 'the ambushers' .  i'd love to know how solo and company escaped from thrush h . q .  after randolph's death though . 
cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours .  famed director richard attenborough  ( gandhi )  is certainly no stranger to the genre ,  and the collaboration of the real-life mr .  and mrs .  woods ,  the main white characters in their book and in this film ,  lends further authenticity to cry freedom .  the video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release .  while the added length serves to heighten the film's forgivable flaws :  uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular ,  another possible flaw  ( the insistence on the white characters' fate over that of the african ones )  may work out as a strength .  viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film  ( as i think it should ,  over its artistic merits )  ,  the story is one which black africans know only too well ,  though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact .  it is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience ,  hopefully driving them to change .  now twelve years after the movie's production ,  cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch .  almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place ,  1987's cry freedom's ideals remain by and large unrealized .  it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans ,  particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it ,  and absorb the film's messages .  in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocaust's exposure ,  south africans' struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories :  cry freedom ,  cry the beloved country  ( ok ,  count it twice if you include the remake )  ,  and sarafina  ( did i miss one ?  )  .  all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles .  not one south african actor has played a major role ,  white ,  coloured ,  indian or black !  )  .  and yes i did miss another international south african drama ,  mandela and deklerk .  though this  ( also highly recommended )  biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted ,  mandela was played by a black american  ( sidney poitier ,  who also starred in the original s . a . -themed cry the beloved country )  ,  while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a  ( bald )  very british michael caine ,  a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement anti-british feelings .  until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy ,  cry freedom is about as authentic as you'll get .  as villified as the whites  ( particularly the afrikaners )  are portrayed in the film ,  any observant  ( non-casual )  visitor to south africa even now in 1999 ,  not to mention 1977 when cry freedom takes place ,  will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained ,  even understated .  looking at cry freedom in hindsight ,  it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all ,  and it is .  but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people's minds yet ,  and that the black africans' goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing .  this is why if you're a novice to the situation ,  cry freedom ,  is your best introduction . 
loopy ,  but shrewd and formidable mob boss vic  ( an excellent performance by richard dreyfuss )  gets released from a mental hospital .  several of vic's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman  " brass balls "  ben london  ( a gloriously manic and over-the-top hammy portrayal by gabriel byrne )  ,  the smarmy jake parker  ( a perfectly smug kyle maclachlan )  ,  and vicious rival  " wacky "  jacky jackson  ( a neat turn by burt reynolds )  all try to bump vic off .  meanwhile ,  laid-back and self-assured hit-man mickey holliday  ( nicely played with low-key confidence by jeff goldblum )  finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy .  writer/director larry bishop brings a supremely hip ,  quirky ,  and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch-black comedy about betrayal ,  loyalty ,  and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok .  the bang-up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums :  ellen barkin as tough ,  sultry moll rita everly ,  henry silva as vic's reliable right-hand man sleepy joe carisle ,  gregory hines as philosophical smoothie jules flamingo ,  diane lane as vic's sweet ,  perky mistress grace ,  billy drago as the slimy wells ,  and christopher jones as brutish rub-out artist nicholas falco .  bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin nick .  popping up in nifty bits are billy idol as a blustery thug ,  michael j .  pollard as the ill-fated red ,  joey bishop as mortician mr .  gottlieb ,  rob reiner as a jolly chauffeur ,  and richard pryor as jimmy the gravedigger .  byrne's delightfully insane duet with singer paul anka on  " my way "  rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight .  a tense and amusing climactic mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical .  frank byers' slick cinematography ,  the outrageously nutty dialogue ,  earl rose's jazzy cocktail lounge score ,  and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one-of-a-kind curio . 
alexandre aja's remake of the hills have eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006 .  not only was it a remake of a classic horror film ,  but it was pretty damned good too .  so ,  nearly a year later ,  we are being treated to the sequel to that remake .  while original scripter wes craven is back as producer and co scripted ,  this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake .  a group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film  ( at least those that remain plus some new ones )  .  there's plenty of gore to be had here .  what annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization .  the viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we haven't gotten into them .  even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time ,  nothing .  gore for the sake of gore is pointless .  there has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting .  nothing that happens here is interesting .  and what is it lately with rape scenes in films ?  here we get yet another one for no real reason .  hopefully this is one set of hills that won't be visited again . 
i'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian .  i am not .  if you are looking for a christian movie ,  i recommend this film .  if you are looking for a good general movie ,  i'm afraid you'll need to go elsewhere .   i was annoyed by the characters ,  and their illogical behaviour .  the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong .  one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal ,  and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this .  i find that offensive :  are we to believe that  " thou shalt not steal "  came from jesus ?  i suppose he wrote the ten commandments ?  and stealing was acceptable before that ?  i rented the movie from netflix .  i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments .  oh well . 
this is one of the best films ever made .  it is a realistic depiction of rural ranching life which was a big part of american history .  the setting is 1906 wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century .  the film keeps your interest without the added hollywood myths .  the whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in america when it was mostly a rural nation .  with this film ,  you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago .  in a beautiful ,  scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive ,  as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure .  see this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history .  this film is worth your time to see .  my only question is - why aren't there more films like this one ? 
the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow .  but good there is also a pause-button .  bruce willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996 .  thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990 ,  then in the first world war and how messed up it all might look like ,  terry gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever .  this ex-monty phyton man knows exactly how genius sf-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better ,  there is the lunatic brad pitt  ( his performance in the asylum is memorable )  and a superb bruce willis who proves he is more than some schwarzenegger-wanna be .  it's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated  ( and yet you can follow )  that every view gives you other surprises .  one of my big favourites . 
the movie never becomes intolerable to watch .  and to tell it straight ,  it has nothing to show either ,  except maybe part-sexy alicia silverstone in a nerdy non-sexy character in revealing quite-sexy dresses .  the story is very easy to follow or there's nothing to follow -- you can see in either way .  there is no suspense ,  little action ,  unimpressive dialogs ,  unsatisfactory sensuality ,  same boring locations and very bland acting .  kevin dillon is totally worthless .  silverstone .  .  .  well ,  i didn't concentrate too much on her acting ,  i confess .  yet as i said earlier ,  if one has nothing to do except watching a movie ,  this won't look so bad .  4/10
this movie is an awesome non-stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a dawid dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes  ,  buffoonish supporting characters  ,  made-up dolls for heroines  ,  nasty villains  ,  wisecracks  ,  rocking soundtrack + choreography and a little dose of action  .    amitabh bachchan and govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen  .  the heroine of amitabh the cop is ramya krishnan and raveena is opposite govinda the cop  .  heroines are mere rouge-smothered props as usual  .  the conmen have no heroines  .  paresh rawal carries his villainous act in daud forward  ( he played a similar don in khoobsurat too )   .  asrani shines in a brief role  .  he does a retake on his famous  " angrezon ke zamaane ke jailer "  act in sholay  .   govinda is impeccable as usual - as a wisecracking  ,  good-humoured policeman pyaare mohan and as a conman chhote miyaan  .  he imitates bihari style of hindi speaking with hilarious results  .  amitabh bachchan  ,  believe it or not  ,  pales in comparison with him  .  but still ab is fine  .  madhuri dixit does a cameo as herself in the song  " makhna "   .  she dances like wind  .    viju shah's music is awesome  .  check out  " kisi disco mein jaayen "   ,   " makhna "  and the title track  .   do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely  .  just enjoy yourself  . 
i saw this piece of garbage on amc last night ,  and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic .  it was awful in every way .  how badly did jack lemmon ,  james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie ? 
this film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2/3 of the journey .  sadly ,  the film ends up being too 'confused . ' while i know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films i got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and i lost interest .   the filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on .  we formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering .   in the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of escapism .  here's what's concerning joe gavilan  ( harrison ford )  at the end of the film :   1 .  his real estate deals 2 .  his affair with a radio psychic 3 .  he's being investigated by internal affairs 4 .  the homicide investigation  if you add in casey's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death .  now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that i hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen .  the impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking .   as if a ridiculous chase sequence wasn't bad enough ,  one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour ,  wasn't bad enough ,  joe gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun .  all these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught .  we already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot-lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension .   while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story ,  i won't .  this could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time .  harrison ford and josh hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by gladys knight is worth noting .  sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable .   while this will probably be better than the likes of  " the hulk "  and  " lara croft ii "  that still doesn't make this film good .  i once heard that harrison ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money ,  i'm not sure if that's true or not .  what is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor ,  this film has neither in its lead roles .  my advice to harrison ford would be :  to stick to indiana jones because at least you can still run . 
hated it .  if you believe that everyone in the south is dumb ,  morally bankrupt ,  stupid ,  violent ,  a religious nut ,  or a child molester ,  then this film may be for you .  everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant .  in one scene ,  two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he had molested a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes .  the man seemed proud of his actions ,  and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life .  very nice .  a teenage girl walks the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers to help her -- despite an obvious limp and lack of food or water  ( no backpack ,  etc .  )  .  strathairn's character is not only thoroughly disgusting and slimy ,  but he is shown to be a religious believer who  ( typical for hollywood )  reflects the vile nature of christians .  a scene in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of cape fear  ( the one with deniro )  -- bible verses being spouted by the bad guy .  i am from the great northwest ,  but found this film offensive because of the wonderful people i know who are from nc ,  wv ,  al ,  ms ,  ky ,  tn ,  etc . 
the film ,  a universal release of a protelco-mlc production ,  is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object ,  capturing it in a cell as  " pure energy ,  "  and then sending it back complete to a  " target area .  "  there is no explanation why this is necessary ,  but professor paul steiner  ( played by pock-mocked actor bryant haliday ,   " devil doll "  )  thinks it's something to dedicate his ,  and his assistants' ,  pat hill  ( mary peach )  and chris mitchell  ( ronald allen )  ,  lives to .    during an experiment before noted dutch scientist  " lembach "   ( gordon heinz )  ,  his machine fails due to sabotage ,  so he has himself  " projected "  by his secretary ,  sheila  ( tracey crisp )  to seek revenge .  of course ,  she screws up and he comes out looking like a  " pork roast "  with the power to electrocute people .    with this new-found power ,  he manages to zap some cockney idiots ,  a security guy named latham  ( derrick de marney )  and his lab boss ,  dr .  blanchard  ( norman woodland )  .  he also is able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat ,  as well .    in the end ,  though ,  despite hill and mitchell's attempt to help him ,  the clown destroys his equipment and himself .  on the whole ,  a completely pointless movie with no message at all .    also one of the most depressing color films you will ever see . 
i liked it ,  i really did .  please don't think that i'm an idiot but i have to admit that i enjoyed this film .  i expected it to be crap ,  it was crap ,  but sometimes its ok to relax and watch a crappy film that you don't have to concentrate too much on isn't it ?  i didn't expect any hidden meanings or morales ,  and there wasn't any ,  but that doesn't matter because i only watched it for entertainment ,  and it did entertain me throughout .  films like this are why the ben stillers  ( excusing 'there's something about mary' )  and the vince vaughns  ( however you spell his last name ,  i couldn't be bothered checking ) have jobs .  it's ok to watch a crap film as long as you don't expect too much from it ,  and i for one shall take a stand ,  jog ,  perhaps run ,  but not drive because i don't have a car ,  to blockbuster video ,  or even choices ,  and rent a bunch of these toilet humoured films and stay in one night watching them .  good day to you reader .  p . s if you do not say that this comment helped you then i don't like you ,  if you do say it helped then god bless you ,  you will go to heaven . 
lol !  !  !  delirious was so funny .  .  i was in tears .  eddie murphys impressions are absolutely spot on .  the best impression was of james brown and mr t> so funny !  !  its weird how eddie murphy was back then and how he is now delirious is a must see but if u don't like foul language don't watch but amazing and so funny .  .  i have seen it 6/7 times and still pee myself every time .  .  this is eddie murphy at his prime and you can see where he got the humour and ideas of movies such as nutty professor from .  he does impressions of his family as well ,  which is real funny .   if only i was there .  .  . 
personnaly i really loved this movie ,  and it particularly moved me .  the two main actors are giving us such great performances ,  that at the end ,  it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters .   the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous ,  and the song are just great the way they are .    that's why i didn't feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards  ( the most rewarded movie at the golden globes )  ,  an oscar and even a grammy .  this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone .  a great movie ,  that has often been criticized  ( maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it ,  surely as a  " co-director "  )  .  her artistry is the biggest ,  and that will surely please you ! 
gday mates !  just watched croc hunter the movie .  it was alright but the show seems more real .  this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters .  a few things :  steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles .  yeeeowch !  for reals you know that hurts .  and cant they jump up high ?  hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff .  there was two major cleavage shots in this movie .  when terry find that baby joey she goes like  " we have to nurture them ,  just like a baby "  .  woah !  i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid .  that woulda made it pg-13 though .  while on terry ,  did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry's knowledge on ritual mating .  she knows her sex stuffs .  movie takes place in queensland ,  austrailia .  i want a koala ,  dingo ,  and joey !   steve's dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie .  albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie .   oh and if anyone else watches this ,  try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc .  he was eating her sheep !  !  i would be mad too ! 
extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of são paulo ,  the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in brazilian urbania .  for the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film ,  it has the grit of mexican feature  " amores perros "  with a character not too far off max cady ,  from both cape fears ,  although this is not ,  by any means ,  a film about a psychopath .  two partners  ( alexandre borges and marco ricca )  in a construction company pay hitman anisio  ( miklos )  to off their third partner  ( and majority share holder )  in said construction outfit .  the murder is blamed on the city ,  but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime ,  not only trespassing but ,  more importantly ,  deconstructing the strict social codes that make up brazilian society .  anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in .  the look is almost entirely handheld ,  grainy ,  the performances outstanding throughout ,  especially so as first time actor  ( and member of classic brazilian pop band 'titãs' )  ,  paulo miklos ,  dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror .   i saw the film at the brasília film fest in november 2001 .  it has since done very well in sundance and berlin .  kleber mendonça filho
spoilers within .   it appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen ,  das  ( 1995 )  .   the direction seemed carefully controlled ,  and visually i felt it was highly appealing - especially where the visual narrative was concerned  ( the title-sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the past )  .   to clarify two points that many people have been confused by :   firstly ,  lena did not sleep with goebbels .  although this may have seemed implied ,  it was not the intent .  von trotta told me so herself !   ( and she is a very nice lady ,  by the way !  )   secondly ,  the time-frame of events was in fact historically accurate  ( the actual dates are shown on the close-up of the memorial )  and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film .  there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this ,  and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free .   overall ,  what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much 'over-movied' era .  it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time  ( for various reasons )  for this film to hit our screens .   more of the same please ,  margarethe ! 
maybe some people may consider this a slow movie .  however ,  it's precisely this  " slow burning "  that allows it to profoundly affect the viewer .  like that marvelous first scene :  first ,  we can hear the voices ;  then ,  we are allowed to see the characters ;  finally ,  the camera slowly pans back and to the side and we see another character ,  a young man who is just sitting there ,  apparently not even listening to the conversation or ,  at least ,  not really caring .  the fact that this young man will be the leading role shows the movie's strategy :  allowing the character to develop and be determined by the environment surrounding him but without remarking the points more than necessary .  people come and go ,  flow in and out of his life .  although most of the movie follows him  ( and most of the supporting characters are only seen when close to him ,  defined according to the relationship maintained with him )  ,  we are induced to believe that we are being objective ,  so subtle is the director touch . 
this is a genuinely horrible film .  the plot  ( such as it is )  is totally undecipherable .   ( i think it has something to do with blackmail ,  but i'm not entirely certain .  )   half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches .  the other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of  " southern "  accents that  ( thankfully )  the words cannot be recognized .   but the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it .   
steven spielberg  ( at 24 )  had already directed two superb episodes of a 1971 series called  " the psychiatrist "  ,  starring roy thinnes .  one episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12-year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man  ( clu gulager in his best performance )  who is dying of cancer .  both episodes were stunning ,  visually unlike anything else on tv ,  and emotionally complex and adult .  the creators of  " the psychiatrist "  were richard levinson and william link ,  who created  " columbo "  and also produced its first season .   peter falk insisted on first rank ,  experienced tv directors for the first season of  " columbo "  ,  like bernard kowalski and jack smight .  but falk agreed to spielberg after watching part of the clu gulagher episode of  " the psychiatrist "  .   spielberg says on the dvd of  " duel "  that he loved steven bochco's  " murder by the book "  script  ( based on a levinson/link story )  ,  and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature ,  even thought he had a lot less money to work with .   this episode of  " columbo "  is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other  " columbo "  episode ,  even though the series always used top directors .  spielberg manages to keep the great falk and cassidy from hamming it up too much ,  but both actors are still a lot of fun .  spielberg also gets fine supporting work from martin milner ,  rosemary forsyth and barbara colby .  all the performances have a freshness and vitality about them .  the only  " columbo "  episode that was close to being as well directed is the  " by dawn's early light "  episode with patrick mcgoohan  ( directed by harvey hart )  .   i think the two episodes of  " the psychiatrist "  and this episode of  " columbo "  suggest spielberg hasn't developed technically all that much as a director .  he was great from the beginning .  in a  " combat !  "  dvd commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring albert salmi ,  robert altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director .  maybe the same is true of spielberg . 
the majority of stephen king's short stories are little gems ,  with original ideas that don't take a long time to develop ;  basically lean and mean--he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages ,  you read 'em ,  and you're finished before you know you've begun .  they're like the equivalent of a carton of mcdonald's fries--they taste really good and you know there's not much nutritional value in them  ( re :  from a literary standpoint ,  they don't say much about the universal human condition )  ,  but you're still gonna scarf 'em down ,  just don't be a pig and go for the extra-super-sized portion and fill up on too much grease  (  " too much grease "  is a metaphor for the prose in king's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on--enough with the pop-cultural observations or clever yankee asides--get on with the story already !  )  he has compiled four books of short story collections .  i've read them all--from nightshift to the latest ,  everything's eventual ,  and they all display an efficiency of getting-to-the-point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome-sized novels .   but his short stories never overstay their welcome .  .  . which brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and dreamscapes .  .  .   how in the hell did they  ( the series' producers )  get a green-light to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes ?  i'll tell you how--two words-- " stephen king .  "  stories with his name on them probably didn't come cheap ,  and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones ,  so .  .  . what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length ,  and double the commercial time .  .  . ka-ching !   i'm not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories--this review supposes you have already read the stories and/or seen the show ;  what follows is merely my gut reactions to what tnt presented .  .  .  of the four installments so far ,  here's my ten cent assessment  ( from first to worst )  :    battleground-- not a classic by any means ,  but hey ,  how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog ?  and the tongue-in-cheek reference and destruction of the killer zuni doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers  ( and the writer of the teleplay ,  who is richard matheson's son--the writer of tot )  knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly ,  yet at the same time ,  fun .  it took longer to get to hurt's apartment than it should have ,  but i think it fulfilled it's objective .  8/10  umney's last case-- liked this one primarily because of william h .  macy's performance .  i think the writer/umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye/umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story ,  and anyone familiar with the king short story  ( probably half ,  if not more of the audience )  knew the chandleresque set-up was due to get interrupted by the writer's reality ,  so let's get on with it already ,  and cut-out the cute and clever hard-boiled repartee' private dick banter already .  once the writer/umney's family tragedy began to reveal though ,  i thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer  ( me ,  at least )  ,  feel sympathy for the real-life macy's attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation's exciting life .  6/10   the end of the whole mess-- uh ,  this title is how i felt about this episode when it was over .  after twenty minutes ,  i was ready to scream at the tv--ok ,  we get it already ,  the younger brother is a mega mensa genius prodigy extraordinaire !  we know from ron livingston talking to the camera  (  " time is running out for me " --not fast enough ,  i thought )  that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity--we know this because he's already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn't steer it out of the path of a tree ;  and ,  he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry  ( to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision )  .  so much time was wasted on establishing the uber-genius of henry thomas ,  when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery--the end of the world through unintended idiocy--how much do we get to see of the world  " ending ?  " --a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she's reporting on ,  and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand .  oh ,  and the brother's parents drooling and singing old songs .  my point is ,  if your story is really about the  " end of the whole mess  ( world )  "  ,  i wanna see the  " mess "  as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns .  talk about ending with a whimper ,  indeed .  2/10   crouch end-- this episode just ticked me off totally .  i could have lived with the taking-forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel ,  playing slap-and-tickle ,  having lunch ,  and getting a taxi  ( that was half the episode right there )  ,  if once they finally crossed-over into crouch end the episode delivered the chills ,  but it failed miserabley .  not only wasn't it scary ,  it was practically laughable .  ooh ,  look--a kitty .  .  . wait ,  it turns .  .  . oh my god !  look at it's scary eye !  uh-huh .  they could have gone a long way towards filming the crouch end sequence at night instead of in daylight ,  too .  things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows .  but i guess the budget wasn't high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one .  on the page ,  this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn't and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there .  the only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting--those were truly horrifying .  1/10   overall series average  ( so far )  :  4/10
now days ,  most people don't watch classic movies ,  such as this .  most of friends only watch movies from the '90s to present .  thats kinda stingy .    most old movies like this are masterpieces ,  unique in their own way .  only because ,  back when these movies were being thought of and made ,  thats when ideas were fresh .  now people strain just to think of new ideas .    anyway ,  to the movie .  for true fans of classic horror .  this is for you .  the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor ,  and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house .    i won't say anymore ,  for i will ruin the movie more than i already have .  but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is .  and would never mind watching it again ! 
this did for crime what  " not another teen movie "  did for school .  i laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs warred with each other and among themselves .  an unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way .  i suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30's . 
this movie feels so empty .  in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10 .  because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird .   the acting was horrible !  it's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor/actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives .  .  looking at the floor for their marks .  .  .   spoilers :  also you'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie .  at one point at sky captain's home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the airstrip .  they have advanced warning an attack is coming .  .  .  so what do they do ?  nothing .  all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain .  .  .   the entire world is under attack and he's the only person ever fighting back .  at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally .  .  .  but what do they do ?  nothing .  .  .  the movie is over .  .  . 
by saying that , i mean that this is not a well made movie but it's a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far . and if you are a ww2 buff then this is a treat for you , cause there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie .  it's theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary .   me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over-human heroes of the second world war , and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won't get forgotten by next generations . cause nowadays kids doesn't read books , they watch movies .   so if you want a action extravaganza , rent private ryan , this is the truth about lingering pain , outrageous endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost . 
this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen .  .  .  it is humorous how bad it is .  .  the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing .  .  ( i've seen porno's with a better plot )  when the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away .  but as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn't going to do anything compared to if you watch it  .  .  i don't recommend renting it but if it comes on tv watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean .  i couldn't watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower
i guess that  " gunslinger "  wasn't quite as god-awful as most of the movies that  " mystery science theater 3000 "  shows ,  but westerns just aren't roger corman's forte .  portraying rose hood  ( beverly garland )  becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies ,  the movie is pretty predictable .  john ireland is rose's new hubby ,  secretly working for unctuous allison hayes  ( yes ,  the 50-foot woman )  .  also appearing briefly is frequent corman co-star dick miller as a mailman  ( miller nowadays stars in joe dante's movies )  .   i do wish to assert that you'll probably want to watch the  " mst3k "  version to really enjoy this movie .  they had a great time with it . 
this is absolutely the dumbest movie i've ever seen .  what a waste of a splendid cast .  that's james cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy .  i could go on and on ,  but i would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script .  the only thing this movie is about is us vs .  them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human being's tolerance .  this is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen -- and i love james garner . 
the lady from shanghai is proof that the great genius orson welles could direct a  " mainstream "  movie if he wanted to .  by comparison to his other ,  more artistic works ,  this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness ,  and almost no esoteric elements .   the exception being ,  of course ,  the final scene in the hall of mirrors ,  widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film .  it alone is worth the cost of a rental .   the sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful rita hayworth .  her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent ,  she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters .  even the great mr .  welles . 
i am a current a . s . l .  student & was forced to watch this movie in class ,  and what i got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film .  the film is obviously leaning towards to p . o . v .  of the  " common deaf perception "  their is no middle ground .  also ,  the film didn't make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic .  i . e .  deaf people who were born hearing and later went deaf .  is it right or wrong in that instance ?  the film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the deaf w/ a capital  " d "  .  not that this is bad ,  but for it to be a true documentary film is should attempt to be slightly unbiased . 
 " film noir "  is an overused expression when it comes to describing films .  every crime drama seems to be a  " noir "  .  but  " where the sidewalk ends "  really is a good example of what the genre is all about .   very briefly ,  an overzealous detective  ( andrews )  accidentally kills a no-goodnik who works for the mobsters .  the killing is blamed on the father  ( tom tully )  of a woman andrews meets and falls for  ( tierney )  .  to save dad from old sparky ,  andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in .   the morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past .  his father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail .  but that doesn't excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no-goodnik in self defense .  he immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates .  he's already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career .  then ,  at just the wrong moment ,  the phone rings .  it's andrews' partner and andrews tells him the suspect they're trailing isn't at home .  he hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the river .   what motivates a guy to do something so dumb ?  okay .  his job was at risk .  but now he's committed multiple felonies .  at least i think they must be multiple .  i counted obstruction of justice ,  assault ,  disposing of a body without a permit ,  littering ,  first-degree mopery ,  and bearing false witness against his neighbor .   in the end ,  we don't know whether to root for andrews or not .  the suspect didn't deserve to die ,  true ,  but it was after all an accident because andrews didn't know he was a war hero and  " had a silver plate in his head .  "  maybe it's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was ,  among other things such as characteristic lighting .  if noir involved nothing more than black-and-white photography ,  murder ,  criminals ,  mystery ,  and suspicious women ,  then we'd have to include all the charlie chan movies under that rubric .   andrews is pretty good .  he's a kind of mark macpherson  ( from  " laura "  )  gone bitter .  he never laughs ,  and rarely smiles ,  even when seated across a restaurant table from gene tierney ,  a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men .  he has no sense of humor at all .  his few wisecracks are put-downs .  when he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says ,   " careful .  i almost hit my head ,  "  andrews' riposte is ,   " that's okay .  the cab's insured .  "  andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well .  his underplaying is perfect for the part .  little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states .  and i guess the director ,  otto preminger ,  stopped him from pronouncing bullet as  " boo-let "  and police as  " poe-lice .  "  never could make up my mind about gene tierney .  she does alright in the role of tom tully's daughter ,  a model ,  but she's like marilyn monroe in that you can't separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits .  did tierney actually have such an innocent ,  almost saintly persona ?  when she answered the phone at home ,  did her voice have the same sing-along quality that it has on screen ?  poor tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff ,  before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder .  and andrews too ,  nice guy though he appears to have been ,  slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements .   the dvd commentary by peter muller is unpretentious ,  informed ,  and sometimes amusing .   anyway ,  this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir .  the good guys aren't all good ,  although the bad guys are all bad .  maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie .  for the kiddies ,  only one shot is fired on screen and nobody's head explodes .  sorry . 
interesting how much more realistic brosnan's performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films .  he's neurotic ,  paranoid ,  an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot .  this is perfect break for him ,  even so much as to make fun of the bond icon .   " i'm a mess ,  a parody of myself "  he says .  it doesn't get any better than that .  i just finished reading dr . no and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond .  personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely .  there was nothing for him to personalize the character with ,  as compared to roger moore or sean connery .  its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall .  a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with .  it's an impressive portrayal ,  and having greg kinear to ground him ,  is just poetic .  this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in  " my blue heaven "  ,  but more genuine in their coping mechanisms . 
i wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry .  porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw .  costumes ?  what costumes ?  a t-shirt with strips of black leather on it .  it was marion's clothes--or lack of them--that really got me .  do the 'fans' of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england .  the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid ,  but the episode with an alien was worst of all .  especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face--an old trick . the hedgehog monster was pretty funny ,  as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows--as if .  the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over' raw-bin hood and liddle john' . the second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan .  .  . 
first of all when i saw the teaser trailer for wendy wu ,  i was definitely excited .  brenda song ,  one of the hottest girls on disney channel ,  would be doing martial arts and i was fine with that .  .  .  until i saw the movie .  the action was poorly constructed ,  the movie couldn't have realated to anyone ,  the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked .  .  .  along with the plot .  if you really think about it's a wannabe buffy the vampire slayer ,  a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women ,  a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen ,  the watcher who bug's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil .  the idea just wasn't all that original ,  the movie is waste of time . 
robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time .  this movie is so wasteful of talent ,  it is truly disgusting .  the script is unbelievable .  the dialog is unbelievable .  jane fonda's character is a caricature of herself ,  and not a funny one .  the movie moves at a snail's pace ,  is photographed in an ill-advised manner ,  and is insufferably preachy .  it also plugs in every cliche in the book .  swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role ,  but so what ?   equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review .  when a movie is this worthless ,  it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape .  avoid this movie . 
 " perhaps we can arrange a meet .   "   " where are you now ?   "   " i'm sitting in my office .   "   " i doubt that .   "   " why would you doubt that ?   "   " if you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face .   "   bourne remains street tough ,  and elusive .  only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy .  conversation is macho ,  to the point with only shards of bond type gallows humour .  its all about the action .   the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well .  a scene set in waterloo with a guardian journalist does this to great effect .  there is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body .   if the shaky cam doesn't annoy you too much ,  enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going . 
i caught this movie on sci-fi before heading into work .  if you've any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times ,  this movie is for you .  if that doesn't peak your interest ,  well ,  i'm afraid you'll wish that you were the one about to be enveloped in flames ,  because this movie is pretty bad .  the acting ,  to begin with ,  is awful ,  awful ,  awful .  the characters are all completely obnoxious ,  and the dialogue is worse than your typical z-grade ,  sci-fi movie .  towards the end ,  the movie began to remind me of 'hollow man'  ( complete with escape via elevator shaft )  ,  except with a dragon ,  not a naked ,  invisible man .  unlike other similar flicks ,  however ,  this one wasn't even awesomely bad .  .  . it was just plain bad . 
very nicely done movie .  it does stay in your memory .  better billed as a romance than flying or war ,  altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free .  flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes ,  unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love .   fun watching early crowe .  he is good and exudes charm .  his reading of  " high flight "  is superb .   cheers ,  boom
i watched this movie .  to the end .  and that was really not easy .  it is so boring ,  bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from  " blair witch project "  that you can't believe the makers take this serious .  even harder to believe ,  is how this  " product "  made it onto vhs and dvd .   so ,  if want to see a horror-movie ,  just watch  " scream "  ,  but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time ,  watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability ,  watch dark area . 
first off ,  this is an excellent series ,  though we have sort of a james bond effect .  what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in 2006 ,  it is chronologically the first adventure of 007 ,  dr .  no  ( 1962 )  being the second ,  while in golden eye ,  the first film with pierce brosnan ,  judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male  " m "  so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double-0 ,  aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older ?  this is more or less a  " poetic "  license to thrill .  we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained .  no ,  the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago .  in the 1960's communicators were fantasy .   ( now we call them cell phones )  and there were sliding levers instead of buttons .  omg ,  do you think 400 years from now ,  they would have perfected rogaine for jean-luc picard ?  so ,  please ,  let's give the producers some leeway .   but to try and make things a bit consistent ,  let us just ponder about the cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of battlestar galactica .  if that is the case ,  where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from ?  we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space .  well ,  what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship ,  loaded with human-looking cylons ,  wound up not only jumping through space ,  but through time ,  back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one .  they colonized it ,  found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves ,  but not before they themselves sent out a  " ragtag "  fleet to search for the legendary caprica ,  only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet ,  which they colonized to become the humans ,  who eventually invented the cylons .  time paradox ?  of course .  which came first ,  the chicken or the road ?  who cares ?  it's fraking entertaining ! 
the movie opens with a flashback to doddsville county high school on april fool's day .  a group of students play a prank on class nerd marty .  when they are punished for playing said prank ,  they follow up with a bigger prank which  ( par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds )  goes ridiculously awry leaving marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough .  fast forward five years ,  where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion .  we find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene ,  as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious ,  jester mask-clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind-numbingly ludicrous fashions .  it doesn't take sherlock holmes to solve the mystery of the killer's identity ,  as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario .  the film takes a turn for the bizarre as marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors ,  only to be haunted by their ghosts .  marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life .  finally ,  the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as marty wakes up in a hospital bed ,  breaks free of his restraints ,  stabs a nurse ,  and finally disfigures his own face .   the script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic .  the only originality comes from the mind-numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched .  the absurd it-was-all-a-dream ending feels tacked on .  it's almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream .   technically speaking ,  the film is atrocious .  some scenes were filmed so dark that i had to pause the film and play with the color on my television .  the acting is sub-par ,  even for slasher films .  i can't help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray ,  which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable .  their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them can't bother to keep their accents straight through the movie .   all of this being said ,  if you like bad horror movies ,  you might like this one ,  too .  it isn't the worst film of the genre ,  but it's far from the best . 
hey ,   if your going to make a documentary about leonard cohen try making it about leonard cohen !  this is filled with only enough leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers  ( some of them questionable )  talk about themselves .  puleeze .  .  .  . sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high - who cares about you ,  what about leonard ?  guess what people ,  if you  " do something "  worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you .  i found particularly insulting the parading of u2's members as if that would add credibility to this movie - not .  leonard doesn't need bono or the edge talking about his spirituality .  what would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film .  gee ,  what a concept !  i will give props to rufus wainwright and jarvis cocker for their covers of cohen tunes - the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable .   cohen fans ,  don't say i didn't warn you ! 
mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in china in 1948 .  wei wei's stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it
i bought this dvd after seeing it highly ranked here .  it's just a short 20 minutes zombie film .  nothing special about it except for the music perhaps .   don't buy it !  not even really worth spending 20 minutes to see it .  only if you're really bored .  .  . 
this is why i so love this website  !  i saw this film in the 1980's on british television .  over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life .  with barely a few key words to remember it by ,  i traced the film here ,  and much information ,  including the fact it's about to become an off-broadway musical  !   interestingly ,  unlike the previous comment maker ,  i do not remember finding this film sad ,  or exploitative .  on the contrary ,  the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength ,  honour and dignity .  ironic you may think ,  considering the squalor of their lives .  maybe it's because i live in britain ,  where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money ,  where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding ;  i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit ,  deep and profound humour ,  whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect .  in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult' .  over the years ,  as it faded in my mind ,  it shone the brightest ,  above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience .  it was such a deeply private expose ,  it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical .  but perhaps somewhere ,  the daughter will be amused by such an outcome .  it is she who will have the last laugh maybe .  .  ( they made a musical out of her before you jackie o'  ) 
not the worst movie i've seen but definitely not very good either .  i myself am a paintball player ,  used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change .  the movie portrays similar qualitys first of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this  " phantom "  guy or whatever ,  they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags ,  autocockers .  one guy sporting a bushy .  not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy .  a bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting  " better guns "  .  another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah the phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap ,  he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the  " professionals "  .   so what exactly is wrong with the movie ?  well the budget is a huge thing ,  a paintball movie wouldn't be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur .  there are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy .  the perception of paintball is pretty bad too .  they seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap .  it just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what paintball is .  to be honest real paintball isn't all buddy like ,  it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not  " respect "  and playing by the rules .  don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming  " 4 is 1 !  !  " 
i really liked this movie .  of course the idea is pretty much out there .  .  . the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding .  but alvin sanders ,  the man who the feds have  " volunteered "  to be implanted with the device ,  is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while .  alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem .  definetly worth a watch . 
so often with stephen king adaptations ,  you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books .  this really captures the heart of the book .  maybe because they don't use large chunks of text straight from the book ,  but it's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story .  a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage .  dale midkiff and denise  " tasha yar "  crosby really act like his parents .  there's a scene where louis is cuddling gage ,  and they are very natural together .  fred gwynne is wonderful .  he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody ,  and is wise and warm just like jud should be .   ( 8 out of 10 ) 
sugar &spice is one of the worst movies of 2001 .  the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails  .  when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie .  i've heard that the dvd has a director's cut maybe i'll check it out ,  but this pg-13 trash movie is s*** and the worst kind of s*** .  maybe if the film had some t&a that would've have made it okay .  but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible .  worse than a troma film . 
luchino visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries .  the great directors of italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium ,  but it was luchino visconti ,  a man of vision ,  who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing .  he clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with  " ossessione "  ,  a film based on james cain's  " the postman always ring twice "  ,  which was later made by hollywood ,  but that version pales in comparison with what visconti achieved in the movie .  luchino visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited alberto moravia ,  a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings .   the film has been well preserved in the dvd format we watched recently .  the film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way ,  something the american version lacked .   what comes across watching the movie ,  is the intensity which the director got from his key players .  the magnificent clara calamai does an amazing job as giovanna ,  the woman who has married an older man ,  but when gino appears in her life ,  all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life .  giovanna is one of the best creations in ms .  calamai's achievements in the italian cinema .  the last sequence of the film shows ms .  calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed .   equally excellent is massimo girotti ,  one of the best actors of his generation who appears as gino ,  the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in giovanna .  gino is the perfect man for giovanna ,  something that mr .  girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen .  mr .  girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy ,  yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent .  juan delanda is seen as giuseppe ,  the older man who fell in love with giovanna .  in fact ,  his character rings truer than his counterpart in the american film ,  where he is seen more as a buffoon .   the film is beautifully photographed by domenic scala and aldo tonti .  they gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way italian directors of the era favored .  the original musical score of giuseppe rosati is perfect .  visconti ,  a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors ,  also includes arias by bizet and verdi that fit well in the context of the movie .    " ossessione "  is a film to treasure because we see a great luchino visconti at the top of his form . 
i can't believe that steven segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors .  i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does .  when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .   the plot is unbelievable as a movie ,  and even if you excuse the visuals ,  and had read this story as a novel ,  you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation .  he shows no effort and no enthusiasm ,  and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all .   i hate to repeat other peoples comments ,  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic .  the condition of those scenes chopped in ,  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time .  the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie ,  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds .  i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget  ( segal being paid 5 of that )  and that the movie still came in under budget .  i must concur .   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie ,  as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie  . 
grey gardens is shocking ,  amusing ,  sad and mesmerizing .  i watched in amazement as ediths jr .  and sr .  bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past .  their existence in a dilapidated mansion ,   ( which they had not left for more than fifteen years )  is both a comedy and a tragedy .  this is a film you will not soon forget . 
another british cinema flag waver .  real garbage on offer here once again .  i cannot understand  ( and i am british )  why this over the top ,  patriotic nonsense was ever made .  eight years mark you ,  from when the second world war had actually ended !  other commenter's here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage .  this is extremely poorly observed .  the archive footage is in abundance .  model aircraft swing from wires in the 'action scenes' like so many children's kites in the wind .  the usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole malta event .  guinness must have his worst acting performance ever .  the shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable .  hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area .  ealing made many great movies .  this clearly is not one of them .  they should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot ! 
ugly shot ,  poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to joe dante's 1981 classic .   " the howling "  is one of the two or three only good werewolf-films ever made and yet it got 'rewarded' by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one .  if it's any consolation ,   " stirba "  is a sequel in name only and there's absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in dante's film .  the plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by stirba .  stirba is played by sybil danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond super-babe  ( with impressive bosom )  in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused .  her arch-enemy is played by a seemly fatigue christopher lee .  his character  stefan crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to stirba's kingdom ,  accompanied by an american couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult .  in case you're exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity .  .  . this is your film .  even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we're even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence .  however ,  if you want a little substance or depth ,  you'll be sorely disappointed .  the dialogues are embarrassing and there's absolutely no tension to detect anywhere .  the scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires  ( the transsylvanian setting ,  garlic ,  wooden stakes .  .  .  )  and danning's gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the film's only gimmick .  during the end-credits ,  a shot in which she rips off her top ,  is re-edited repeatedly  ( according to my fellow reviewer dr .  gore ,  no less than seventeen times !  )  which is pretty pathetic and pointless .  the music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful .  i'm talking about the fierce-looking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of stirba's castle .  the directing by philippe mora is a giant mess and  as far as i'm concerned  his only worthwhile film remains  " the beast within "  ,  released three years earlier . 
as you may have gathered from the title ,  i wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time .  the acting ,  camera-work ,  writing ,  special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked .  people have argued that while this movie is terribly-acted and terribly-produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script .  wow .  the plot has more holes than i or anyone else could possibly count .  for starters ,  why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe ?  i know the government's supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country .  there wouldn't be anyone to govern !  another thing that i was wondering about ,  even if the government told everyone to go to work ,  why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies ?  were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet ?  and how about the ending ?  that stupid torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies .  he probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature .  and another thing ,  why does he say hindenburg before he dies .  the hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people .  the zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country ,  possibly the world .  he doesn't think anyone else will get a few snapshots ?  they also managed to ruin the only semi-interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer .  why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl ?  especially when the zombie could have come through the door .  it's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand .  every day i pray that god with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in feeding the masses .   anywho ,  i think it's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production .  hey trent haaga ,  i'm calling you out ! 
this schiffer guy is a real genius !  the movie is of excellent quality and both entertaining and educating .   i didn't know what a weather girl was before i learned it here . 
having only seen two of his pictures previously ,  i've come to terms with altman .  before ,  though ,  i always labeled his style of film-making  " boring .  "  you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius .    " health "  is fairly underrated ,  and very questionably out of print .  in fact ,  i don't think it's ever even been issued to vhs .  why is that ?  when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily ,  this one is left behind for no good reason ?  honestly ,  i had no real problems with this film .  it was ,  for the most part ,  consistently amusing and funny .  almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason ,  be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances .  there is real skill here .   and paul dooley's stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating .   if you can ,  try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem .  it's not perfect ,  but it's much better than most of the sludge out there getting dvd releases .  hell ,  i'd be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thing .   it's often on the fox movie channel ,  though ,  so look out for it . 
indian summer !  it was very nostalgic for me .  i found it funny ,  heartwarming ,  and absolutely loved it !  anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the  " good ole' days "  for a brief time really needs to see this one !  it starts out as 20 years later ,  a group of old campers returns for a  " reunion "  .  i won't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself .  the actors were great ,  and it contains an all star cast .  everyone in it played a terrific role .  you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it .  alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou .  he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives .  this is also a good family movie for the most part .  i would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat !  highly recommended ! 
evil breed is a very strange slasher flick that is unfortunately no good . the beginning of the film seems promising but overall it's a disaster . the dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad as the acting . the acting is brutal and unbearable . most of the characters deliver there lines horribly and even if that is on purpose the method doesn't work because the characters become annoying . some of the kills are innovative but it took far too long to get to them . after about a half hour through the movie we get the first death  ( other than in the beginning ) and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes . the movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous looking characters , unrealistic karate like fights , and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulled out of his a*sscrack . none of it is funny it's just plain ridiculous . the film then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless . most of the characters are clichéd even for slasher standards and are as solid as butter left on the counter for 5 days . evil breed isn't even laughably bad therefore it fails in it's main task . watch texas chainsaw massacre , just before dawn , or see no evil for a real slasher . 
so .  .  .  it's really sexist ,  and classist ,  and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie ,  like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change .  well ,  he certainly changed his tune ,  and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit .  what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers .  the end of the movie does not make her a hero ,  it makes the whole thing sad .  and its sad that people think it makes her a hero .  perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away .  positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience .  yuck . 
without  " mental anachronism "  ,  this film which i would like to find in dvd offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the  " disenchantment of the world "  .  that ,  there is thirty years ,  a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding .  it would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included/understood ,  analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of  " primitive thought "  .  because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior ,  that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance .  if somebody knows where i then to get a numerical copy or vhs to me or dvd thank you in advance . 
an interesting idea  ( four african american women crushed under society's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks )  is ruined by f .  gary gray's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script  ( by takashi bufford and kate lanier )  full of unintentionally funny moments .  instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them ,  gray ,  bufford and lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy .  it's melodrama at its worst .  gray has his actors linger over every tired line and john carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack ,  choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers' bemused faces .  and bemused they are :  although actors such as jada pinkett ,  kimberly elise and vivica a .  fox have some raw talent  ( queen latifah is the fourth and as an actress she's an excellent rapper )  ,  they need a surer hand than gray's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera .  steer clear . 
as with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up .  even the grim ripper made us smile .  those two alien things made me laugh ,  bill and ted were the stupidest yet the funnest in the entire movie .  this is a lot better than the first one .  and yet for some reason i feel that it misses something .  something big .  something important .  made a better house and girlfriends .  no ,  i'd say better villains .  use clones instead of robots . i gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic doinks .   the grim ripper ,  don't be scared he's not the deathy kind ,  is funny .  when he fell from the sky i split a gut .  splat ,  i'm not sure about those aliens .  what where they ?  scientists ?  no way . 
be careful with this one .  once you get yer mitts on it ,  it'll change the way you look at kung-fu flicks .  you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung-fu films now ,  you will be wanting character depth and development ,  you will be craving mystery and unpredictability ,  you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops .  sadly ,  you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung-fu movie ,  except for five deadly venoms !   easily the best kung-fu movie of all-time ,  venoms blends a rich plot ,  full of twists and turns ,  with colourful  ( and developed )  characters ,  along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s .  the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which ,  and who specializes in what venom .  one is the centipede ,  two is the snake ,  three is the scorpion ,  four is the lizard ,  and five is the toad .  each character has different traits ,  characteristics ,  strengths ,  and weaknesses .  therein lies the hook ,  we learn along with the student character ,  finding out who these different men turn out to be .  we are in his shoes  ( so to speak )  ,  and we have to pick who we trust ,  and who we don't ,  just like he does .  we learn along with him .   not only is the plot ,  the characters ,  and the camerawork great ,  it's also fun to watch ,  which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it's kind .  it's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that's going on .  venoms is a lesson on what kung-fu can really do .  .  . just don't expect many other kung-fu films to live up to it's gauntlet . 
i have yesterday seen the second part .  and i must say ,  it was actually better then the first one .  at the begin ,  i realized ,  it is actually a sequel ,  not a remake but not a good one .  i do not like the old movies and series of galactica ,  because the cylons saw like toasters  ( just as it was mentioned in this new movie )  and were completely harmless for the old galactica .  this movie turns the sides - the humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid .  many scenes were unnecessary ,  for instance the story of the  " computer expert "  - completely a crap .  if i were a scriptwriter i would leave him die in his house ,  killed by the cylon woman .  and the evacuation from the planet ?  oh ,  please if it would be bombed by 50 megatons  ( why exactly 50 mt ?  ?  )  nukes ,  they would be dead killed by the radiation .  and how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack ?  aha ,  it was possibly this computer virus ,  created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten-years-old school boy .  the good side of the movie is ,  that the humans are at last defeated !  !  really defeated ,  the population is near the extinction  ( children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie :  1 .  a baby !  !  !  maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence .  .  .  )  .  and the bad-asses won and i think it is the first time in such sci-fi galaxy fight movie .  i also appreciate the design of the cylons  ( not only of the humanoid cylon : - )  a good job with these ships - i like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons .  the human ships are a good never version of the old ones .  and galactica - really pretty with these docks ,  i liked that .  but this is all ,  only the design is not enough .  the acting was really bad ,  the whole plot was expectable  ( only two things not - the human-cylon on the ragnardocks and the human-cylon at the end )  . the dialogs were trivial  ( and in the slovak dabbing just stupid ,  but that is not fault of the movie )  .  the whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series ,  but who would shoot such series ?  what it would be about ?  one star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity . 
the sitcom  " the league of gentlemen "  follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village  " royston vasey "  .  the different scenes are linked together by their common setting .   in the first series ,  a sketch show ,  the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through royston vasey .  consequently ,  more foreigners visit the small town .  but edward and tubbs ,  the owners of a  " local "  shop ,  which is actually far away from the town ,  do not like foreigners .  whenever a visitor enters their shop ,  they kill him .  in my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all ,  for example ,  when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road .  edward drums ,  while tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims .    moreover pauline lives in royston vasey .  she works at the local job centre .  although pauline hates the people she has to work with ,  the woman does not want to loose her job .  so when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman ,  she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet .   then there is barbara dixton ,  a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about  " her "  sexual conversion .   furthermore the vet ,  mr .  chinnery ,  always kills animals instead of curing them .  in one case ,  he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room ,  where a dog lays in his basket .  the farmer goes outside .  on the assumption that the dog is the sick animal ,  mr .  chinnery euthanizes him .  a second later ,  the farmer opens the door ,  holding the  " real "  sick animal ,  a sheep ,  in his hand .   some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew  ( his friend is killed by the shop owners ,  by the way )  .  the couple is very tidy .  they have ,  for example ,  towels in different colours .  each colour stands for one part of the body .  besides ,  they have thousands of keys ,  marked with different colours and precisely classified .   in my opinion ,  the actors play very well .  by playing women ,  the scenes become comical .  the costumes are suited to the actors ,  too .  tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters ,  for example edward ,  have unappetizing black teeth .  the show has a great deal of dark humour ,  typical british .  the set design reflects the mood of the series .  the village and all the houses look grey and are decayed .  around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect .  even the village sign is ominous :   " welcome to royston vasey .  you will never leave .  "   although i think that the actors do a great job ,  this type of series is not my taste . 
i found this to be a so-so romance/drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it .  it's not a hallmark hall of fame-type family film with sleeping-before-marriage considered  " normal "  behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro ,  i would have expected a lot rougher movie ,  at least language-wise .    the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult .  that's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but ,  to be honest ,  the film isn't that memorable .   it's still a fairly mild ,  nice tale that i would be happy to recommend . 
i love this film .  it is well written and acted and has good cinematography .  the story blends action ,  humor ,  mysticism ,  and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots .  see it ,  buy it ,  show it to your friends .   the acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero .  i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions .   i cared what happened to these people and ,  while the outcome was pretty predictable  ( the good guys win ,  the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives--who doesn't see that coming ?  )  ,  it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end .  thank god this film's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel .  grab some popcorn ,  cuddle up on the couch ,  and watch this fun ,  happy and entertaining film . 
this movie i've loved since i was young !  its excellent .  although ,  it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film  ( for example ,  our hero's name is achilles ,  and in the final battle between him and alexander he's shot in the heel with a rocket ,  just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel )  .  that's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing !  anyway ,  great movie ,  good story ,  it'd be neat to see it redone with today's special effects !  oddly enough ,  gary graham had average success ,  starring in the t . v .  show alien nation .  this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated ! 
unless you are petrified of russian people or boars ,  this movie is a snorefest .  actually ,  i fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater .  i wish i had .  a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday evening .   even  " silent hill "  was scarier .  heck ,  even  " pan's labyrinth "  was scarier .  i'm still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick .   to begin with ,  i'm very leery of movies that use  " pidgin russian "  like this one did in the opening credits .  it's embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends & we all cringed .  oh my god .   hmm .  well ,  luckily for me  ( & probably you ,  too )  this movie has already escaped my brain & i just stepped out of it an hour ago .  so i have no specifics ,  just murky visuals that go nowhere & some languishing-now-dead hope that anything would happen .   perhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i can't believe it got such great reviews here  ( which is why i saw it )  & ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as well .   i give it a 2 because ,  yes ,  i fell asleep & wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up & didn't leave . 
comparison with american graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic .  speaking of timeliness ,  there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie .  they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong .  there were sly reference such as 'they paved paradise to put up a parking lot' .  the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan .   the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers .  almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie .  very little of what the characters said were believable .  combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail .  although ,  there were two exceptions kelli williams liven things up as the future flower child and ,  despite what another reviewer said ,  rick shroeder was quite good .  showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in  " n . y . p . d .  blues "  . 
jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing ,  but in this movie .  .  .   besides the direction ,  writing ,  lack of plot ,  constant mugging  ( aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots )  ,  and a  . 050 joke batting average ,  it was still an utter waste of time .  the idea sounds promising ,  but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i've seen this side of you-tube .   i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively .  while that's no doubt true ,  i really don't think this movie is meant to be racist .  i think that's it's more a result of a  " creative "  team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess .  you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera :   " hey look ,  it's an ugly mexican !  laugh ,  people !  please ,  for the love of all things tenacious ,  laugh !  "   but put the racism charges aside .  when you get down to it ,  it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended ,  imo . 
i saw this film over the weekend and while i was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of church-produced films ,  i left disappointed that this one fell so short ,  failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions .   the film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of joseph smith .  it's not a true biopic because there's no real coherent narrative .  most of the episodes concern joseph doing good deeds ,  playing baseball ,  running races and laughing with children ,  often in sloooow motion .  what a great ,  just folks kind of guy that joseph was ,  huh ?  look at him out there beating rugs for his wife emma .  well ,  howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives ?  ?  no mention whatsoever is made of polygamy .  a glaring omission .   and it is in such omissions where the film falters .  it supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering why is joseph getting tarred and feathered ,  why is he getting thrown in jail and why does that mob want to kill him ?  the film's climax is of course joseph and hyrum's trek to carthage jail  ( riding past a veritable united nations of faces looking out from nauvoo's doorways )  .  but no mention is ever made about why .  nothing about smith suppressing the nauvoo expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy .  the audience is left to wonder or to assume it's just more baseless persecution of the church .  no mention of joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the nauvoo militia .   of course i certainly did not expect this church-produced film to present the joseph of richard bushman's recent biography rough stone rolling ,  but i was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presented .   and worse ,  what substance that was presented was often inaccurate .  two examples jumped out at me .  first ,  the translation of the book of mormon .  the film shows joseph reading right off the golden plates in their two-ring binder ,  which plates in reality were hidden far from the site .  it's well known that joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat ,  peering at the seer stone in there .  the second inaccuracy occurs at carthage jail ,  where the mob storms the cell .  the history of the church reports that joseph had a six-shooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the masonic signal of distress  ( as reported in times & seasons )  .   maybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the heart-tugging mood the filmmakers had created ,  but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show joseph as he really was :  handy with a gun and able to defend himself .  in fact ,  the impression the film gives is that joseph was a nice guy ,  but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up ,  tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood .  he was far from that ;  joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believed .   see the film ,  but know going in that's it's cotton candy .  then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of bushman's biography of smith ,  rough stone rolling   ps :  church-produced films have no credits ,  but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces .  rick macy is excellent as joseph smith ,  sr .  and bruce newbold ,  beloved as thomas in finding faith in christ ,  here plays the cranky methodist minister who failed to show christian love to a young seeker after truth . 
overall i found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch ,  with plenty of laugh out loud moments .    but ,  this movie is not for everyone .  that is why i created this quick question-ere ,  if you answer yes to any of the following questions than i recommend watching this flick   ( 1 ) do you enjoy crude sexual humor ?   ( 2 ) do you enjoy alcohol related humor ?   ( 2 ) do you enjoy amazingly hot girls ?   ( 3 ) do you enjoy viewing boobs ?   ( 4 ) do you enjoy viewing multiple boobs ?   ( 5 ) did i mention all the nice boobies in this film ?   if you noticed the spoiler alert ,  that is referring the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie ,  i myself have no idea what the plot was about .  not that it matters . 
this short spoof can be found on elite's millennium edition dvd of  " night of the living dead "  .  good thing to as i would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it . replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper .  in execution ,  it's a different matter .  this short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me .  i really never thought i'd say this ,  but  " night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil ,  mutant ,  alien ,  flesh eating ,  hellbound ,  zombified living dead part 2 :  in shocking 2-d "  was a very better parody and not nearly as lame or boring .   my grade :  f
creature unknown is the right word for this movie .  or maybe it should be called unknown movie .  this movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning .  it has a really stupid  " plot ,  "  really pathetic  " acting ,  "  and so-so  " special effects .  "    some thirty-something year old  " post-teens "  are trapped in the woods with a mad ,  reptilian ,  rubber-suit creature lurking around endlessly .  what you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and precious little action .  you have girls walking through the woods talking ,  and then you have guys  ( with heavy mascara on )  walking through the woods talking .  the whole thing is so boring !   the creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie .  when it is shown the picture is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit ,  and the movement shows that it is a suit ,  hence the reason for the blurring and distortion of the image .    this is not a good movie in any since of the word and the ones here who have praised it are most likely the people that were picked up off the street to  " act "  in this truly stupefying movie !  skip this one for certain ! 
ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful .  it's an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america .  also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accent .  .  . it is the worst film i have seen in a long time
one reason pixar has endured so well ,  and been so successful ,  is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics ,  they have a story to match their style .  and often very moving style at that :  affecting ,  charming and cross-generational .  that a lot anime  ( speaking in broad terms )  and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is ,  i think  ( and i might be wrong )  partly because either the makers aren't bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image ,  or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous ,  so enervating that they don't have the energy to create a really engaging story .   that same cannot be said of renaissance .  there are flaws in its plot ,  but i'll get to that later .  those same flaws ,  however ,  are not reflected in the visuals - renaissance is nowt short of stunning .  the ultra-high contrast images  ( sometimes so high-contrast that is nothing but one face or one beam of light visible )  and incredible detail are always impressive ,  always a joy to behold .  the futuristic paris on display is the grim offspring of blade runner and brave new world ;  dark ,  murky ,  quite affluent and even clean ,  but shrouded in intrigue ,  corporate malfeasance ,  obsessed with beauty  ( capital of the catwalk ,  after all )  and disguising the squalor and neglect of its labyrinthine passages with a veneer of monumental ,  sophisticated architecture .   it's a compelling environment ,  not entirely original ,  but great all the same .  the film's much-touted 'motion-capture' technology and incredible attention to human and design minutiae result in images a black-and-white photographer would die for .  not that the detail prevents entertainment ,  because christian volckman crafts some superb action sequences :  a hell-for-leather care chase ,  a couple of gruesome ( ly imaginative )  murders ,  several tussles in the dark and a nasty dust-up in a gloomy apartment .  the locations are great ,  too  ( i want to visit the nightclub )  .  while the central character of karas is your regular off-the-shelf maverick cop ,  the other two female characters  ( who are sisters )  are the real motors of the movie .  coming from war-torn eastern europe ,  products of a war ,  diaspora and a family spat ,  they're a compelling metaphor for europe as a whole .   the film is tremendously atmospheric ,  its dizzying ,  swooping faux-camera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience .  however ,  the plot .  .  .  it never becomes more interesting than the initial hook ,  in which indefatigable plod karas must find ilona tasuiev ,  a drop-dead gorgeous and pioneering scientist ,  after she's snatched from the street .  the sinister corporation avalon  ( is any corporation ever not sinister ?  )  ,  which she was working for on 'classified' ,  projects are hell-bent on her retrieval ,  and soon karas is up to his neck in official reprimands ,  dead bodies ,  cigarette-smoke and narrowly-missed bullets ,  and falling in love with ilona's sister bislane  ( very sympathetically voiced by catherine mccormack )  ,  as he plumbs the depths of the city's sordid underbelly  ( and his own past )  .   text-book noir ,  in other words ,  but while i enjoyed the film a lot more than sin city  ( to which it bears a passing visual resemblance )  ,  the plot and resolution are dull ,  the theme of immortality being raised but never examined ,  and the shenanigans of high-rolling avalon ceo paul dellenbach are also dull  ,  undercutting a lot of the dramatic tension .  the basic ideas are familiar sci-fi genre materials ,  and there's a nagging sense that the visuals and atmosphere are disguising the mundane material .   however ,  the film as a whole is lucid and perfectly coherent ,  even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical wizardry .  but it's the projection of life in paris circa 2054 ,  the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold .  i may be taking it too seriously ,  and if that's the case i can at least say that it's superbly made ,  extremely entertaining  ( and pretty mature ,  too )  ,  and with an ambiance like no other . 
if i had realized john wayne was in this movie ,  i would not have watched it .  it's demeaning to the japanese ,  unfortunate for hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person .  but then ,  most john wayne movies are like that .  hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved americans when the truth was  ( and still is )  somewhat different .  the movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of japan .  maybe it's hollywood that should be isolated . to put it as succinctly as possible ,  this film is appalling jingoistic claptrap .  ( sort of a madama butterfly with bad music .  ) 
it's a good thing i didn't watch this while i was pregnant . i definitely would have cried my eyes out and/or vomit .  it was kind of gruesome mainly disturbing .  i personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little way . however as a mom i cringed when beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when virgina aborted the child during her 3rd trimester with rusty utensils no less . also , as an animal lover i almost cried when she scratched the cat to a bloody pulp . however , as creepy and sinister as the baby was i was rooting for it to live . and as twisted as the movie was i am extremely intrigued to see the sequel .  .  .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .  . 
larry burrows has the distinct feeling he's missing out on something .  ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship ,  he's been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot .  then one night his car breaks down again .  walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck ,  larry happens upon barman mike ,  who unbeknown to larry is about to change his life for ever .  .  .  .  .  .  .   the alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing ,  stretching back to the likes of it's a wonderful life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent sandler vehicle that was click .  it's a genre that has produced very mixed results .  back in 1990 was this james belushi led production ,  rarely mentioned when the said topic arises ,  it appears that it has largely been forgotten .  which is a shame since it oozes charm and is not short in the humour department .  we know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end ,  but it's a fun and enjoyable path to be led down .  the film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor james belushi was .  i mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation isn't your thing ,  ?  then chances are you would avoid this film anyway .  but for those engaged by the likes of red heat ,  k-9 and taking care of business ,  well mr .  destiny is right up your street .  along for the ride are linda hamilton ,  michael caine ,  jon lovitz ,  hart bochner ,  jay o .  sanders ,  rene russo and courteney cox .   mr .  destiny ,  pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart .  7/10
i'm grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent !  !  !  yay !  !  !  this programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed victoria beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and 'brand f*cking beckham' .   a few years ago i used to really like 'posh and becks' ,  i still very much admire david's talent ,  but i have no respect for him anymore .  how can you respect someone who has his wife's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet .   it was clear the hand of victoria was all over beckham's premature departure from manchester united and now the same thing has happened at real madrid .  i hope beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds - he's sold his soul for the american buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from division one in england  ( no offence america - but at baseball and basketball you rule - football you don't !  )    anyway - i digress .  it's been years since i've seen such an over-the-top ,  entirely false performance from 'posh' - this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the rebecca loos 'debacle' ,  when instead of throwing all the cr*p at david he deserved ,  she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money-spinner her marriage has become .   this whole pr stunt was pathetic .  why can't she just go over there quietly ,  support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down ?  when did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to america should be shrouded by this huge fan fare ?    incidentally ,  i saw the david beckham documentary last night .  at least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility .  two things his wife could do with learning .   one more thing victoria - you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps .  little hint - stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman .   good luck america !  ! 
this is one of the very worst films clark gable made .  only parnell was obviously worse .  it is just so painfully clichéd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of making .   gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going' to the slammer  ( like the gangster talk ?  )  .  she holds out hope that he'll do the right thing but he just leaves her there--unknown to either of them ,  gosh ,  that she's  " in the family way "  .  eventually ,  the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending !  they seemed to have forgotten about gable's needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow .  leonard maltin says  " the stars are at their best here "  .  by what standard ?  best at producing unintended chuckles ?  gimme a break !   ps--after saying this ,  my wife thinks leonard maltin is going to find me and kick my butt .  hmmm .  however ,  despite my comment ,  i think mr .  maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet  ( i hope that appeased him )  .   update--2/2/08 .  because i disliked this film so much the first time  ( especially the ridiculous ending )  ,  i decided to watch it once again .  after all ,  sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more and realize that i was a bit too harsh .  while that has been the case with several films in recent months ,  i still disliked this film--even the second time .  most of it was not because of the first half of the film .  in the first half ,  harlow's character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable .  but when she was sent to prison ,  it was all clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred .  the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb--it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons .  i stand by my original review  ( despite all the  " not helpfuls "  )  and think that aside from parnell and possibly polly at the circus ,  it might just be the worst gable film . 
let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlin's directing style ,  for the most part ,  and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots .  unlike harlin's  " elm street 4 "  ,  and  " die hard 2 "  which i really liked ,  there is something that is missing from this movie .  that ,  my friends ,  is a script .  the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful ,  but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity .  there are so many awful lines in this movie ,  i don't even want to have to remember any of them .  not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure .  it's almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said ,  they could improve the script .  wrong again .   the sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue .  stallone has never been a favorite of mine ,  but when he is acting circles around lithgow ,  turner ,  and the worst of the bunch rooker ,  there is something wrong with this picture .  lithgow played one of the best villains in  " ricochet "  ,  yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here .  how is that possible ?  i've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone ,  who himself still phoned-in his performance .  turner's part is so small and pointless ,  but she still manages to appear lost on screen .  michael rooker can act .  i know this because i have witnessed it in  " days of thunder "  ,  but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards .  has it come to this ?  when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking ,  i just wanted the movie to end right there ,  or have them both amazingly find their acting ability .  unfortunately ,  neither of those things occurred .   which brings me back to harlin ,  who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters .  it's his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all ,  because he should have made the people actually act .  the script is not very good ,  but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director .  i don't care how much was paid for the special effects ,  which for the most part are good ,  you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting .    plus ,  the pacing of this movie seems to be off .  the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done ,  but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all .  i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene ,  but i really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene .  if the bad guy's would have won early ,  maybe i wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever ! 
although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film ,  the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb .   yaara ,  studying at princeton ,  returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend ,  talia .  because yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother ,  she has lost her adoptive sister .  and because yaara ,  blind from birth ,  has been guided and guarded by talia ,  her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable .   inevitably ,  the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death .  though without sight ,  she has insight .  though she cannot see ,  she is able to find what is out of sight than the  " normal "  people around her .  the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with talia ,  in her adoptive family's house ,  in tapes ,  diaries ,  and people in talia's past and present .   told from yara's point of view ,  the film is also seen from her point of view ,  as she visualizes what she hears ,  believes ,  and imagines .  the solution to the mystery is rather conventional ,  but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare ,  that the pat moment is easily forgiven .  the truths emerge gradually yet inexorably ,  clarifying not only talia's life ,  but also her relationship with yaara .  tali sharon ,  as yaara ,  uses her mobile face and voice effectively ,  and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl .  we accept fully her ability by the film's end to find her place in the world more confidently .   noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious ,  the dead-on acting by the minor characters ,  and the interesting decision to represent talia only as a teenager .  i will quibble with yaara's final declaration as stands with gadi ,  talia's last boyfriend ,  at a cliff's edge ,  but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled . 
the first time i had the window of opportunity to see this all but forgotten classic was back in the early 1980's , at one of our art houses as a revival .  as i watched this fever dream of an exercise in 1930's sexuality ,  i thought yowza !  they got away with murder in europe back in the day .  unfortunately ,  this film was heavily cut in it's original u . s .  release by the blue nosed hayes office  ( the staunch government censorship board , started by the  " holier than thou "  bible thumper ,  will hayes .  .  . a former post office official , if you can believe that )  , due to it's overall theme of human sexuality  ( heaven's forbid humans actually had sex in the 1930's )  .  the plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman  ( played by hedy lamarr ) who marries a much older man , and later regrets it .  she  ( lamarr ) meets a handsome younger man & has an affair with him ,  resulting in a divorce from previous husband  ( another no no in hollywood movies back then---divorce !  )  .  despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933 ,  it was probably the director's first time working in the sound format  ( i . e .  the film seems to possess techniques that were used mostly in silent films---i . e .  1920's expressionism's )  .  it's still worth searching out for a window into early european talking pictures , along with luis bunuels l'age dor  ( 1930 )  , and karl gustav dryer's 'vampyre'  ( 1931 )  .  not rated , but contains that infamous nude swimming scene & some thinly veiled sexual references ,  which would fare little more than a pg-13 by today's standards  ( but would have easily landed the dreaded 'x' , back in the 30's , if it existed then ) 
ooof !  this one was a stinker .  it does not fall 'somewhere in between star wars and thriller' ,  thats for sure .  in all actuality ,  it falls somewhere between the cracks of a wham !  video and captain eo ,  only with not as big of a budget ,  and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying .  simon le bon preens front and center ,  while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from roxy music's last 3 albums .  brief clips from barbarella add nothing .  avoid at all costs .   ( however ,  i liked the part when they played 'hungry like the wolf' but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman painted with tiger stripes ?  i mean ,  they aren't singing 'eye of the tiger' or 'hungry like the tiger' it's a wolf !  whatever .  )  a dvd of duran duran's '80s videos is probably worth a look for nostalgia's sake
 " the brak show  "  is good  . probably not in the same level than  " aqua teen hunger  "  or  " space ghost coast to coast  "  ,  but definitely it have many brilliant moments  . basically it follows the life of zorak and brak that have normal lives and go to the school  , living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50 'sitcoms  .  the humor and the animation of this show it's very much as  " aqua teen hunger  "   ( and in one episode you could see meatwad )  with bizarre situations and strange characters  . but it is good  , it have funny parts  .  some of the songs are great  , others not very much but i like this show  .  the funniest character is the father of brak  .   ( that is a human  , nobody knows why  ) 
i expected a comedy like the  " big mama "  movies .  instead ,  the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy ,  drama and a love story .   this movie has three plots :  the first involves madea and her taking in a foster child .  the second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her .  the third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father .   there is actually very little comedy in the movie .  there are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie .  for example ,  madea beats the foster child with a belt  ( in a comedic manner )  ,  to convince the child to straighten out .  the child does ,  in fact ,  turn herself around .  apparently ,  it pays to beat children .   there are plots dealing with child rape  ( with the consent of the mother )  .  there are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them .   ( the ogling takes place at a family reunion .  )  the movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance .  is this a comedy ,  a love story ,  or a drama ?  it is ,  in fact ,  nothing  .  .  .  except a waste of time and money . 
this movie is once again ,  one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it .  anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a moron !  my advise would be to take two not one but two hits of very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it !  !  although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid !  !  !  !  being that this comment requires 10 lines of info ,  let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie .  unintelligble .  garbage .  schitzoid .  waste of talent .  movie is ice ,  with paper on destination with ringing clouds ,  on a sunny dive in the pudding .  .  .  .  sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair .  now explain that to me !  !  !  ! 
the tooth fairy is set in a small town somewhere in northern california where peter campbell  ( lochlyn munro )  has brought a farming property which he is renovating & planning to turn into a holiday inn ,  he is joined by his girlfriend darcy wagner  ( chandra west )  & her young 12 year old daughter pamela  ( nicole munoz )  who arrive to help for the weekend .  while exploring the property pamela meets another young girl named emma  ( jianna ballard )  who warns her that evil lurks within her new home ,  she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the tooth fairy who takes baby teeth from children & then kills them .  pamela is worried & becomes even more so when she falls off her bike & her last baby tooth falls out ,  it's not long before the evil ghost of the tooth fairy has her eyes on pamela's tooth & just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across .  .  .   directed by chuck bowman i thought the tooth fairy was just another poor straight-to-video low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other's which litter video shop shelves & fill late night obscure cable tv schedules ,  basically it's not very good .  the script by producer stephen j .  cannell ,  corey strode & cookie rae brown is a complete snooze-fest for the first 40 odd minutes ,  nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all & is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone .  it introduces the character's ,  sets the tooth fairy legend up & that's it .  the second half of the film improves slightly but even then it's hardly spectacular stuff ,  there are a few decent set-piece gore scenes but apart from that it's all very predictable & forgettable stuff .  the character's aren't great & most of them are there purely to be killed off ,  the story has inconsistencies like the story of the tooth fairy herself ,  it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth ?  what happened to her after the prologue set during 1949 ?  why has she come back as a ghost ?  despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself & using weapons to kill people ,  there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment .   director bowman does ok ,  it's reasonably well made & there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about .  there's nothing i would describe as scary or atmospheric in here & don't take any notice of the comparisons between this & darkness falls  ( 2003 )  as besides the teeth thing they're quite different .  the gore is ok ,  someone is shoved into a wood-chipping machine ,  there's a decapitation ,  someone has their penis chopped off & the best scene when someone is nailed to a door & then has their stomach hacked open with an axe & their guts slide out .   with a supposed budget of about $1 , 500 , 000 the tooth fairy is generally well made but there's nothing special on show here .  the acting isn't anything great but it's not too bad & unusually i didn't find the child actors that annoying so that's something i suppose .   the tooth fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight-to-video horror fare that seems everywhere these days ,  if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it's pretty poor & forgettable stuff . 
so far nightmares and dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing .  the first segment ,  directed by brian henson ,  may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares ,  but at least it was well-directed ,  suspenseful ,  and visually interesting ,  with solid acting by william hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series .   however ,  the second story in the series was just dreadful ,  and not in the good way .  the screenplay is bad ,  requiring the shallow ,  unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot ,  and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky ,  unnecessary exposition .  the acting is overdone and unconvincing ,  and i felt far more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second .  the director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky ,  but with the amateurish acting and writing ,  the end result looks like a freshman-year film school project ,  with camera moves for their own sake ,  and little in the way of plot or tension .   if the rest of the series continues like this ,  i'll be sorely let down .  i look forward to william h .  macy's installment ,  and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment .  so far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way . 
this has to be one of my favourite flicks ,  unlike the weak 'elvira's haunted hills' .  .  . anyway i love the way the movie is a goth/com 'wizard of oz' story .  .  .   elvira is a goth dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a good witch  ( elviras aunt morgana )  .  .  . she inherits a  " ruby "  ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the bad warlock  ( her uncle )  .  .  . she befriends four characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow .  there is a show down with her uncle  ( the wicked witch of the west )  where elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him .  in the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination las vegas  ( dorothy's home in kansas )  .   there are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie .  .  . she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters .  elvira :   " youe must be aunt em ,  and you must be uncle remus .  .  .  . there's no place like home ,  there's no place like home !  "  bad uncle vinny :   " i'll get you my pretty ,  and your little dog too !  "   there is a sign that elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of kansas .   but aside from this ,  the fact that one of the sequences she  " ripped off ,  um .  .  . i mean was inspired by flashdance "  is pure genius .  .  . and if you don't roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her  " very 80's "  las vegas show then you haven't got a camp bone in your body .  .  . this movie is a cult/camp classic
valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director's distaste for war .  the audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but ,  we learn that europeans at the interval between wwi and wwii ,  had concerning pacifists ( for lack of a better term )  .  the speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film ,  are inspiring given the time .  although the revised edition ,  through the transfer technology of early foreign films ,   " cuts-off characters heads "  at times ,  this film holds it's own in many different aspects .  character analysis ,  lighting techniques ,  historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker .   pabst went on to direct and put to screen weil & brecht's  " three penny opera "  ,  starring the original star ,  lotte lenya . 
considering how much money was budgeted for this film ,  you would expect more from the story as a whole .  this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched .  there was no real advancement of anything .  character development ,  minimal .  plot advancement ,  maybe .  enjoyment ,  none .  i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made .  if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys ,  american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions ,  all capitalists are corrupt ,  and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death ,  have at .  for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point ,  we'll stick to other movies .  in summary ,  this was a horrible attempt at an 'ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on ,  nobody who made the movie did either .  home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece . 
i really liked this film when it was released ,  and i still do ,  because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general ,  and people too .  .  . one of the things i like about the films of lawrence kasdan .  in addition to the positive vibes from the film ,  there are other reasons to like grand canyon .  for one thing ,  it has an outstanding cast .  .  . kevin kline and danny glover ,  for example .  in my opinion ,  crash ,  the highly acclaimed film that won the oscar for best picture ,  was very similar to this film .  the difference is that grand canyon leaves you feeling positive .  crash had the opposite effect with me ;  it was very dark .  i would choose grand canyon over crash any day . 
in 1967 ,  mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness .  when they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago ,  something evil slipped through before the gate was closed .  twenty-two years ago ,  the government paranormal research agency bureau 713 was directed by professor lionel hudgens  ( matthew walker )  ,  who performed experiments with orphan children .  on the present days ,  one of these children is the paranormal investigator edward carnby  ( christian slater )  ,  who has just gotten an abkani artifact in south america ,  and is chased by a man with abilities .  when an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night ,  he discloses that demons are coming back to earth .  with the support of the anthropologist aline cedrac  ( tara reid )  and the leader of the bureau 713 ,  cmdr .  richard burke  ( stephen dorff )  ,  and his squad ,  they battle against the evil creatures .   in spite of having a charismatic good cast ,  leaded by christian slater ,  tara reid and stephen dorff ,   " alone in the dark "  never works and is a complete mess ,  without development of characters or plot .  the reason may be explained by the  " brilliant "  interview of director uwe boll in the extras of the dvd ,  where he says that  " videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore "  .  further ,  his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty-five years old .  sorry ,  but i find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations .  i have a daughter and a son ,  and i know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says .  further ,  imdb provides excellent statistics to show that mr .  uwe boll is absolutely wrong .  my vote is three .   title  ( brazil )  :   " alone in the dark  o despertar do mal "   (  " alone in the dark  the awakening of the evil "  ) 
this filmfour funded sci-fi movie is most definitely a must see .  while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise ;  it's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive ,  despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film .  it's good to know that films like this are still being made  ( even if they aren't getting wide releases )  ,  and cypher is refreshing for that reason .  the plot twists and turns ,  which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher's mystery .  the plot follows morgan sullivan ;  a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons ,  to him ,  unknown .  however ,  his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita .  .  .   this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future .  this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type ,  with it's only real close affiliate being kubrick's a clockwork orange .  the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing .  you never quite know where you are with the plot ,  which serves in making it all the more intriguing .  the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars ;  jeremy northam and lucy lui .  northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale ,  and does well with his role .  lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn't quite fit her talent ,  but she has a look about her that just fits this movie .   cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent ;  but on the whole ,  if you want an inventive recent sci-fi film ;  cypher is the way to go . 
yikes did this movie blow .  the characters were weak ,  the plot weaker .  i figured this couldn't be too bad because it has christoper walken ,  oops .  he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money .  the characters were supposed to be irish but noone had an irish accent .  i am desperately trying to find something nice about this ,  i can't except walken did a fine job with a wooden character .  find something to read ,  or watch discovery ,  don't ever see this movie . 
probably encouraged by admirers of her much-better  " orlando "  ,  potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way :  she writes ,  directs ,  stars ,  and actually co-writes the music ,  including a mawkish love song .  the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her .  but potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable ,  and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango .  perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked .  she just can't act ,  whether playing herself or not .  pretentious ,  over-ambitious ,  dull ,  and silly . 
metro-goldwyn-mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market .  this market is essentially dominated by the looney tunes and the merry melodies shorts ,  coming from warner bros .  but mgm is also able of releasing hidden gems ,  like  " to spring "  ,  an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year .   in the environment depicted here ,  spring isn't caused by natural cycles ,  but is fabricated .  and by who ?  by little male elves who live below ground .  each spring ,  when the snow begins to melt ,  they start working .  they begin by felling rainbow rock columns ,  then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids ,  which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass ,  flowers .  .  .  in other words ,  spring !  the first half of the cartoon depicts spring's fabrication ,  but the second part is a little bit different .  old man winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves' work .  so from this point ,  we assist to a battle between the elves and old man winter .   the music heard here is deliciously wonderful .  the melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet .  the second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action .  this is just fantastico ,  giorgio !  the animation sequences are also a delight .  the colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive ,  epic environment .  the concept itself is brilliant .  the elves are attracting characters ,  so is old man winter ,  who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season .   there's also a strong message included here .  the battle seems lost for the elves at the end ,  until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves' victory over winter .  so the point is :  only one single person can make the difference .   in conclusion ,   " to spring "  is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era .  what is even more remarkable is that this cartoon's director made his debut here .  and who is  " to spring " 's director ?  it's a certain william hanna .  .  . 
some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them .  as i watched this film ,  made in 1988 ,  in 1999 ,  i thought i was watching the o . j .  simpson debacle  ( although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation )  .   the australian news media ,  if this movie is to be believed ,  devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought .  it was scary to see the scenes of invasive ,  swarming media hordes ,  ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society .   equally appalling is the media's depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case .  i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case  ( the accused are seven-day adventists )  .   today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important .   streep is excellent as usual ,  and this is the best i've ever seen sam neill .  the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible . 
ringmaster ,  jerry springer's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film .  first of all ,  it was made .  second of all ,  people went to see it .  third ,  some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen .  if a monkey could make a movie ,  i'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good .  most crappy movies have their moments ,   ( even godzilla had a few cool special effects )  this film's moment was when i left the theater nauseated .  the only thing that possibly could've made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star .  if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half ,  i'll take a dump in a can .  if anyone didn't utterly despise this movie ,  i pity you ,  and your children ,  and your children's children's children ;  however ,  contrary to springer's beliefs ,  i clearly don't condone children having sex . 
poor will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible german-tv adaptaion of his classic play .  it's obvious that very little money was spent on it .  a stage riser ,  a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set .  the movie was ineptly dubbed into english ,  with the english voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines .  the whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it .  and just where was fonterbras in this movie anyway ?  mst3k gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved .   to be or not to be ?  i wish this movie never was in the first place . 
the secret of kells may be the most exquisite film i have seen since the triplets of belleville .  although stylistically very different ,  kells shares with triplets and  ( the jaw-dropping opening 2d sequence of )  kung fu panda ,  incredible art direction ,  production design ,  background/layout and a richness in color that is a feast for one's senses .  kells is so lavish -- almost gothic in its layout  ( somewhat reminiscent of klimt )  ,  wonderfully flat in general overall perspective ,  ornate in its celtic & illuminated design ,  yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing -- and it all works together beautifully .  you fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them .  you are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil & brush .  what tomm ,  nora ,  ross ,  paul and all at cartoon saloon  ( & their extended crews )  have achieved with this small budget/very small crewed film ,  is absolutely astounding .  the groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal .  this film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire .  congratulations to kells on its many accolades ,  its annie nomination as well as its current oscar qualifying run .  they are all very well-deserved nods ,  indeed .  .  . 
i won't mention any of the plot ,  because ,  although it would be highly predictable anyway ,  the one notable plot twist is given away everywhere ,  in the movie comments ,  in the plot summary here ,  and even in the synopsis on my netflix envelope .  i might have enjoyed it more if i hadn't known that .  maybe .  this film has a deceptively good cast ,  most of whom did creditable acting with the rather limited material at hand ,  including donald sutherland ,  lesley ann warren ,  and tia carrere and rosemary dunsmore in smaller parts .  it was impossible to like william mcnamara ,  but that was clearly by design .  and there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the callipygian lenore zann .  but none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me .  don't any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before signing on ? 
heh ,  if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5 . 9 ,  will you call me crazy ?  that's just to catch your attention .  everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies ,  who seem to only know the recent blockbusters .  it's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies ,  especially those with good artistic values .  dick tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated ,  in terms of technology .   the negative reviews mainly complained about dt's  " messed up "  story .  but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear ,  and i had no problem following it .  i didn't see the comic books ,  yet i am not a huge us comic fan ,  but i appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances .  maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell .  but ,  if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together ,  what would you expect .  i had some scratches on my head ,  and can't help but wonder ,  did we really see the same movie ?  the title role ,  although not as competent as it sounds ,  still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences .  madonna was more express-less than  " breathless "  in her seductive role ,  but added a lot of fun to the story .  al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself .  apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles .  we can see a hybrid of scarface ,  michael corleone ,  adolf hitler and robert de niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh .  and many thanks to make-ups .   to me it's not bad at all .  the surreal feeling really got me . 
the jokes are obvious ,  the gags are corny ,  and the characters are walking characatures - but i couldn't stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie .  no matter how many times i see it ,  i still get a kick out of this one ,  and i recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment .  it contains many quotable moments ,  and some of the best sight-gags i've seen to this day .  if you've had a bad week and you need a chuckle ,  rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start . 
i hand't seen the restored ,  or any version for that matter ,  of  " baby face "  with barbara stanwyck till i caught it on tcm .  what a great movie !  in a nutshell lily lives in a speakeasy ,  she's been pimped out by her own father since she was 14 !  then his still blows up and he's killed leaving lily  ( stanwyck )  alone cept for her black maid chico ,  played very nicely by theresa harris .  lily leaves for the big city  (  new york )  deciding to use her sex to get to the top .  she does this in great style !   she seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy !  one dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law ,  also lily's sugar-daddy ,  then commits suicide !  lily barely blinks !  stanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is .   then in paris ,  she falls for courtland ,  played by george brent ,  they marry ,  but when he's in deep financial straights ,  she bolts .  nearly free with chico and a half-million ,  she realizes she loved court !  lily races to find him ,  but will she be too late ?    this is pre-code hollywood at its best .  stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect .  this reminded me of  " original sin "  with angelina jolie ,  another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman ,  those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings ,  will not like baby face any better ,  those with belief in sex ,  love and power ,  will love it .  highly recommended !  see it ! 
a pre-code stunner with stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps her way to the top .  these pre-code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination .  stanwyck is outstanding as lilly the daughter of a speakeasy owner/father who sold more than booze to his patrons ( johns )  . after the old man dies ( good !  )  barb heads for the big city for better things . she uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top .  john wayne makes a poor  " cameo "  and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach .  i loved the banter and strong lines between the actors .  i highly recommend this film to all film buffs and to watch stanwyck who is great and beautiful as lilly . 
 " the house of the spirits "  is quite awful .  i live in south america ,  in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe ,  and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality ,  this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid .  things are not so simple and linear as appears here ,  and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in  " the house .  .  .  "  .  if you can't show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all .  there are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema ,  without so many commonplaces .  in some parts i felt that carmen miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees .  when you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public's intelligence . 
there are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one .  even if you were totally oblivious of ed wood's work ,  one look at that commentator from  " plan 9 from outer space "  and you just know you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece .  just like that ,  when i saw the first shot of uwe bolls masterpiece  " house of dead "  ,  with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from sin city ,  i knew i'm in for a helluva ride .   so ,  the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die .  you know ,  to keep you wandering .  then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like  " karma .  . thinks she's foxy brown "  or  " alicia .  . my ex .  .  we broke up recently .  .  i had to study and she had to fence "  .  no ,  i'm not kidding .   anyway ,  this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper-bag are going to the  " rave of the century "  ,  rave in question being a few tents ,  a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the pacific .  our gang missed the ferry ,  but thankfully will find a way to get there ,  the way being a fisher-boat ran by kirk  ( cpt kirk ?  get it ?  man ,  whoever wrote this script is a genius )  and his sidekick who is a bastard child of simpsons' cpt mcallister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer .   to make the long story short ,  the gang gets to the island ,  finds nobody there except some bloody t-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there .  no wait ,  they do not ,  they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze .   with that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill .  some guys in rubber suits start running around ,  there is some screaming and shooting ,  our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang ,  they go out of the house ,  meet cpt kirk and some police woman  ( who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons )  and then decide to go back to the house .  somewhere along the line they transform into a s . w . a . t .  team ,  enter the matrix ,  the rubber-suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and i start to cry because i actually paid to see this .  to add insult to the injury ,  every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few characters when they die .   i seriously hate this movie .  it doesn't even fit in that famed  " so bad it's good "  category .  it's just plain bad .  the script is bad ,  the zombies are awful ,  there is no tension ,  lines are bad ,  actors are bad .  .  the list just goes on .   you will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful .  don't .  there are bad movies that deserve to be watched .  this is not one of them . 
this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date ,  the best part was christian j .  meoli  " leonard "  attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar ,  kind-of like i wanted to do on the dvd ,  to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film .  it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good ,  i mean with sean astin  " andrew "   ( played his part perfectly ,  did a great job ,  too bad it was in this film )  ,  kyra sedgwick  " bevan "  ,  ron livingston  " chad "  ,  renée zellweger  " poet "   ( they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie .  .  .   if the cast had any dignity ,  they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer / director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom
at first i didn't didn't like it that much ,  although i did .  they didn't include the third trueba generation ,  the love between blanca and pedro wans't well explained and some actors were too different from what i had imagined .   later i realized that ,  had the movie been more loyal to the book ,  it would have been like five hours long ,  and would be kind of tedious .  now i like it very much ,  because my favourite characters are there as i portraited them .  clara really looks like an angel in live ,  and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic ,  loyal and short .  glenn close is ferula .  i pictured her just like that ,  only not in mourning throughout the whole thing .  esteban is find enough .  i never really liked his character ,  and ,  although i was interested in him ,  i hated him a lot ,  more specially when he hit clara .  as in the book ,  the very last part is the most exciting one ,  and it has real history too there .   the movie is really good ,  specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book .  its amazing how many famous stars are there ,  don't you think so ? 
a give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10 .  two of the best actors of their time-walter matthau & george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director herbert ross ,  and all of that makes this stage adaption come true .  the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70's .  i love the type of humor in this film ,  it just makes me laugh so hard .   i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago  ( yes ,  vhs because it was cheaper-only $3 )  .  i watched it as soon as i got home ,  but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time .  the second time i watched it ,  it felt a lot better ,  and i laughed a lot harder .  i'm definitely going to re-get this on dvd because i have to see the special features .   it's very funny how that happens .  two people work together as entertainers/actors/performers .  they get along well on stage ,  but really argue off stage ,  they can't survive another minute with each other ,  then some 15 years later ,  you want to reunite them for a tv special .  you can find that in this film .  matthau & burns were terrific in this film .  it's a damn shame they died .  george burns deserved that oscar .  he gave a strong comic performance .  he was also 78 when this movie was filmed .  so far ,  he's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age .  jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress .  richard benjamin was also fantastic in this .  he won a golden globe for best supporting actor .  he deserved that golden globe .  although many people might disagree with what i am about to say ,  everybody in this film gave a strong performance .  this comedy is an instant classic .  i highly recommend it .  one more thing :  whoever hates this film is a  " putz " 
the humor in who's your daddy is such poor taste that i actually closed my eyes in certain scenes .  close ups of semen are not funny !  nobody thinks they are .  people get nervous when they see something so gross and to hide their nervousness ,  they laugh .  watching who's your daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling . 
flame in ,  flame out .  that seems to be gammera in a nutshell ,  a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon .  i'm not a fan of japanese monster films ,  but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd sci-fi collection put out by mill creek/treeline films .  it's a great value at about twenty five bucks ,  so at fifty cents per movie ,  it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings .   gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast ,  and he's not happy .  like godzilla ,  he takes it out on tokyo ,  setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet .  they arrive at 'plan z' ,  the hope of the world ,  and wouldn't you know it ,  there's a scene where a huge shed is shown that's called the 'z plan' building ;  that was a nice touch .   by the mid 1960's ,  this country still wasn't quite politically correct .  one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee .  i guess there weren't any privates around .   good old gammera was quite the sight though ,  walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged .  that's why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship ,  whisking him off to mars to save the world .  high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save ,  now let's get back to the cold war .   like godzilla ,  gammera spawned at least a good dozen films ,  but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying ,  flaming turtles .  especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has  " attack of the monsters "  with a featured guest appearance by the big g .  it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films ;  it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said 'gammera ,  sayonara !  " 
corky romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific  " comedy's "  ever made .   while the sometimes amusing chris kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious 'undercover brother' his character in corky is so stupid and so unfunny-which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea .  to bad they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the script . 
i have to admit when i went to see this movie ,  i didn't really have high expectations .  but even with my low expectations i was totally and utterly disappointed .  .  .   basically luke wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends .  there's slight mention of a girl stalking him but that's pretty much it for that character .  which i don't quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie .   so while on a subway rainn wilson  ( who i actually liked before this movie )  convinces him to talk to a  " hot "  girl ,  uma thurman .  this is strange to say the least ,  as everyone can clearly see that uma thurman does not belong under the category of  " hot "  .   rainn wilson's performance is also far from  " hot "  .  normally i'm all for his acting ,  but even he couldn't salvage this movie .  his character was jumpy ,  unrealistic and rather annoying .  you could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy ,  or just desperate .  it was almost painful .   but anyway ,  someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway ,  and luke wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber .  now we all know that uma thurman is the superhero ,  or  " g-girl "  as they like to call her in the movie .  it still baffles me as to what the  " g "  stands for ,  but we'll leave that for the message boards to debate .   the sex scenes i assume are supposed to be funny ,  but i find myself asking who has sex like that ?  they nearly throw the bed through the wall because of uma thurman's  " passion "  let's say .  it makes my head hurt ,  but not in the  " i'm thinking really hard to understand this "  way .   when uma insults anna faris ,  calling her a  " whore "  i had no debate with that .  apart from the fact that she can't choose movies properly ,  she can't act and relies souly on the fact that she's blonde and typical .   overall i would've walked out of the theater if i hadn't paid $8 . 75 to see it .  the characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry ,  especially uma thurman .  someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesn't mean you're acting .   also ,  the script and storyline could've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid .  i actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors ,  and their dying careers .  overall ,  if you value your money ,  and your self respect do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie . 
to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible .  every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images ,  through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero ,  but every frame is real .  the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york .  jules  ( 28 )  and gideon  ( 31 )  naudet  ( pronounced  " nau-day "  )  want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters ,  beginning with a  " newbie "  from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter .  seeking the help of their close friend ,  actor james hanlon  ( 36 )  ,  an actor and firefighter at station 1 ,  engine 7 ,  the naudets sift through the  " probies "  at the academy and find one ,  tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on .   tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close-knit family .  firefighters have a superstition about  " probies .  "  it is that they are either  " white clouds "  or  " black clouds ,  "  meaning that with the latter ,  all kinds of fires follow the  " probie .  "  the former means that very little fire activity follows ,  but one day ,  there will be the mother of all fires .  tony is a  " white cloud .  "  after some initial growing pains ,  tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet .  then the unthinkable occurs .  .  .  .   september 11 ,  2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street .  because jules has had little camera experience ,  gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief ,  t .  k .  pfeiffer .  arriving at about 8 : 42 ,  the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate .  then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene ,  and as jules pans upwards ,  we see the first strike of the day .  american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade .  pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center .  once there ,  jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower .  pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him .  once inside ,  the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives .    gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area .  once there ,  he captures the impact of the second plane ,  united airlines flight 175 ,  with 2 world trade .  he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers .  watching and capturing the crowds' reaction to the unimaginable ,  gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan .  inside tower one ,  jules records the last view the world ,  or loved ones will have of their sons ,  fathers ,  uncles ,  grandfathers ,  husbands ,  boyfriends ,  friends as one by one ,  each firefighter ,  carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped .  jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother ,  kevin ,  as he leaves to do his selfless duty .  also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones ,  sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke .  but jules is respectful ,  never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment .  .  . the money shot .  his work is professional through his baptism of fire .  he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building .  then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken :  father michael judd ,  the chaplain for the fire department .  then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two ,  tower one begins its structural collapse .    what results is a breathtakingly ,  poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day .  not knowing if either is alive ,  each fearing the worst .  as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse ,  they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back .  and in one moment of overwhelming emotion ,  jules and gideon are reunited .  as jules cries on his brother's shoulder ,  gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject .  there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos ,  who left the station with a former chief ,  is believed to have been lost .  .  . but returns to the fold ,  this  " probie "  has proven himself .   shown with only three interruptions ,  9/11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking .  it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds .  the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject .  in lesser hands ,  the tendency would be toward the sensational ,  but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion .  narrated by hanlon ,  we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11 .  robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre ,  restrained way .  he never seeks the camera for his own glory ,  rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see .  i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special .  chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings ,  they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished .  this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is .  it isn't about dribbling a basketball ,  or selling an album of hate lyrics .  .  . 9/11 is about humanity at its best .  heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom .    
what does the marquis de sade have to do with egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults ?  tobe hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film .   genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in alexandria ,  egypt .  genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker  ( and blatant lesbian )  who services daddy on the side .  daddy gets sent back to the site ,  where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it .  genie meets a descendant of the marquis de sade ,  and falls for a hunky egyptian  ( providing the film's hottest scenes )  .  eventually ,  genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going .  wrapped around this story is footage of the marquis de sade in prison ,  talking to a portrait of what looks like genie .   robert englund is terrific as both the marquis and his descendant .  his acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements ,  so he is allowed to shine here .  his best performance is still in  " killer tongue ,  "  if you have not seen that yet .   the rest of the cast ,  including young genie ,  are pretty and average .  the script ,  however ,  is problematic .  you will quickly learn that the marquis scenes are completely unnecessary ,  except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set .  the mermaid cult that eventually saves genie makes no sense whatsoever .  who the mermaid is is never explained ,  and its link to christianity  ( which is hyped throughout the film )  is nothing .  the film is very anti-christian ,  as the archaeologist is a bible spouting father ,  but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute .  there are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence ,  but hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say .  i know i have no idea .   so why am i recommending this film ?  it is weird .  there is an extended sex scene .  for the ladies ,  hunky egyptian rides a horse completely nude .  englund is marvelous .  do you like snakes ?  this film is full of them .  this is like roger corman with a bigger budget .  knowing hooper somehow came up with  " crocodile "  after this is rather sad .   " night terrors "  is not perfect ,  but definitely worth a winking ,  unserious look .   this is rated  ( r )  for physical violence ,  some sexual violence ,  gore ,  profanity ,  female nudity ,  male nudity ,  sexual content ,  sexual references ,  and drug abuse .   
i saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie .  the only thing i did see was quentin tarantino's seeming insane obsession for it .  .  .  there were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality .  overall however ,  i found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous .  the hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks i found clumsy and dizzying ,  even sickening .  overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the u . s .  military against various malcontents .   the various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and  " conclusions .  "  a depressing movie  ( not a true _film_ ,  a term i reserve for true art )  that left me with a bad feeling .  do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a  " romantic comedy "  though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content ,  form ,  and conclusion any association with this genre .   i suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of imdb and other ratings sources . 
at least among those movies with 100 votes or more .  nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen ?  brenda blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role ?  ?  nominated for best picture ?  ?  i always disagree with many of the oscar picks ,  but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the academy .  the writing and acting were both horrible .  blethyn's perfomance in particular was one of the worst i've ever seen ,  and probably the most over-rated acting performance of all time .  awful movie ,  not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it ,  including hbo ( where i saw it )  .  i am only thankful i didn't actually pay to see one of the most over-rated movies of all time . 
isabel allende's magical ,  lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic south american family was vandalized .  the lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted--largely due to a magnificent cast of anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive latin mellifluousness of allende's characters ,  and a plodding scandinavian directorial hand--was so uncomfortable in its own skin that i returned to the theater a second time to make certain i had not missed something vital that might change my opinion .  to my disappointment ,  i had not missed a thing .  none among meryl streep ,  jeremy irons ,  glenn close and vanessa redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director bille august .  all of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned ,  as if ,  by putting forth as little effort as possible ,  they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets .   ( yes ,  the film was art directed within an inch of its life .  )  curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing kfc products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970--years before kfc came into being .  back then ,  it was known by its original name :  kentucky fried chicken .  even pardoning that ,  what on earth is kentucky fried chicken doing in a military dictatorship in south america in 1970 ?  american fast food chains did not hit south america until the early 1980s .   " the house of the spirits "  should have been the motion picture event of 1993 .  because it was so club-footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented ,  miramax had to market it as an art film .  as a result ,  it was neither event nor art .  and for that ,  isabel allende should have pressed charges for rape . 
my family goes back to new orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie i knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about ,  but we knew it existed .  i have cousins obviously black aka african americans and others who can  " pass "  as white and chose not to .  it's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that cane river is all a part of that history .  it makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of african heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence .  .  . and at the same time had i not come out of that history ,  i probably wouldn't be the successful business woman i am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world .  the acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor ,  but it is a movie that needed to be made .  anne rice is incredible and i ask myself ,  why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and i'm not .  i recommend this movie to everyone .  leza
unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for imdb equate low budget with not good .  whatever else this movie might need ,  more budget really isn't part of it .  big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another lara croft movie .  what we have here is a step or two better than that .   the nearly unknown alexandra staden is captivating as the enigmatic modesty ,  and this is crucial for this movie to work .  her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable ,  and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't leaver her face .  it makes it workable that the bad guy nikolai ,  played by also little known  ( in the u . s .  at least )  nikolaj coaster-waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her ,  something modesty can exploit .  she is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out  " stop wasting my time !  "  then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen .  making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident .   probably the biggest problem i have with the rail-thin staden playing modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like coaster-waldau and beat him .  she just ain't a peta wilson or a pumped-up hilary swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch .  coaster-waldau letting himself be overpowered by staden looks like he's just roughhousing with his little sister .   since this is not really an action film ,  this isn't a big flaw .  i just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels . 
this show is one of the worst shows of all time !  absolutely no original jokes and they're always a year late .  like in 2009 they will finally say something about michael vick's dogfights .  all of the cast members are people who wanted to be on s . n . l but had to go to the lowest of the low ,  mad tv . its an hour of mad magazine jokes witch aren't funny to begin with ,  told by terrible john stewart wanna bees .  so if you have any problem tell me id love to hear the opinion of the 3 people who watch this show .  family guy put it well  " osama bin ladin was hiding in the one place no one would look ,  the cast of mad tv .  there is a reason why no one watches the show . 
79/100 .  fred astaire and ginger rogers never made anything but great films together .  although this is not one of their best ,  it is an excellent musical .  there are a few outstanding musical numbers ,  good support from randolph scott .  two notable appearances ,  betty grable and lucille ball make memorable early screen performances .  ball is particularly good ,  and a blonde as well .  the  " let's face the music and dance "  is one of the musical duo's best numbers ever .  harriet hilliard ,  better know as harriet nelson of  " ozzie and harriet "  plays ginger roger's sister .  the basic plot is pretty familiar ,  but with a cast this exceptional ,  it works .  excellent art direction and score . 
a frank capra wonders of life film .   keeping the blood pumping through our veins is the responsibility of hardworking hemo the magnificent .   in the mid-1950's ,  at&t and bell science teamed with famed hollywood director frank capra to produce a series of cbs television science films to educate the public about the universe around them .  a far cry from the dreary black & white fodder so often foisted off on young scholars ,  the capra films would both instruct and entertain with lively scripts and eye-catching visuals shown in technicolor .  the four films - our mr .  sun  ( 1956 )  ,  the strange case of the cosmic rays  ( 1957 )  ,  hemo the magnificent  ( 1957 )  ,  the unchained goddess  ( 1958 )  - quickly became schoolhouse favorites ,  where they were endlessly shown in 16mm format .   the star of the series was dr .  frank c .  baxter  ( 1896-1982 )  ,  an affable english professor at the university of southern california .  this avuncular pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor ,  genially imparting to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a manner which never made them seem dull or boring .  dr .  baxter ,  who won a peabody award for his achievements ,  continued making high quality instructional films after the capra quartet were concluded .   hemo the magnificent ,  which was produced ,  written & directed by capra ,  relates the story of the human heart and blood circulation system ,  using animation and gentle humor .  film star richard carlson appears as the fiction writer ,  energetically helping dr .  baxter tell hemo's tale .   movie mavens will recognize sterling holloway as part of the tv production crew ,  and the voices of marvin miller ,  mel blanc ,  june foray & pinto colvig as various cartoon characters ,  all uncredited .   the devotional scripture which begins the film is completely in tune with the tenor & tone of the production . 
here are some examples of pat robertsons dubiously claimed  " relatively good track record "  on predictions  in his widely reported comments from the january 2 edition of the christian broadcasting network's the 700 club ,  during which he predicted that there would be  " very serious terrorist attacks "  and  " mass killing "  in the united states in the  " second half "  of 2007 ,  host pat robertson boasted that he had  " a relatively good track record "  on earlier predictions .  but a review of robertson's 2006 new year's predictions undermines that claim .  he predicted ,  for example ,  that :   *  " president bush is going to strengthen .  "  wrong  *  " the fall elections will be inconclusive ,  but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the republicans in charge .  "  wrong  *  " the war in iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion .  we'll begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year .  "  way wrong  further ,  as a january 3 associated press article reported ,  robertson has a history of making dubious predictions :   the broadcaster predicted in january 2004 that president bush would easily win re-election .  bush won 51% of the vote that fall ,  beating democratic sen .  john kerry of massachusetts .  wrong  in 2005 ,  robertson predicted that bush would have victory after victory in his second term .  he said social security reform proposals would be approved wrong yet again !    he claims to speak directly with god .  .  .  if so god has quite the sense of humor watching pat make a fool of himself again and again .  . 
one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and  " gymkata "  happened to be on ;  i watched way too much of it .  it is indeed hilarious ,  and horrifying ,  really .  think about it this way--if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this ,  how long exactly would you last ?  not as long as this movie .  it's a must-see ,  obviously . 
i like bad movies .  i like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration .  then there are abhorrent movies like this .  redline is not just a bad movie ,  but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please ,  for the sake of the viewer ,  at least proofread scripts before funding a movie .   if a stereotype took a crap ,  this movie would spawn from that .  the storyline is unbearable ,  and the acting all around is laughable .  nadia bjorlin and eddie griffin have ,  perhaps ,  the worst screen chemistry i've seen in a good while ,  and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants  ( about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for )  .  furthermore ,  how angus macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that i can't even think of an analogy .  i am a loyal fan of his ,  but this has made me question him .   to sum it up .  several people want revenge for different reasons  ( and if you care enough to know what they are ,  you're a bigger person than me )  ,  so much so that it turns to violence  ( i guess )  .  the movie is like ouroboros ,  the snake that swallows its own tail ,  in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears .  this movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half ,  and an indecipherable action movie for the rest ,  it should be avoided at any and all costs .   i wish i could find one positive aspect to this movie ,  and i think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll .   p . s .  nadia bjorlin ,  if that was you singing those two songs in this movie ,  then you are a hack ,  and i hope old age ravages you .   p . s . s .  if you do rent this movie looking for a laughable experience ,  listen for the lyrics to nadia bjorlin's awesome songs . 
arthur bach needs to grow up ,  but that is unfortunately not the only thing he needs to do .  according to his extremely rich father ,  arthur has to marry a certain wealthy susan johnson or he's cut off from the family money  ( $750 million dollars worth )  .  the problem is ,  arthur doesn't love susan  ( though i hear she makes some good chicken )  and has just fallen head-over-heels for the waitress and part-time shop-lifter linda marolla .  arthur is an interesting fellow .  he's really just a big kid ,  born into riches with at least one person looking after him every second of every day .  working just rubs arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun ,  womanize ,  and of course ,  drink .  drinking gives arthur a sort of jekyll-and-hyde complex ;  and while that gets him into all sorts of trouble ,  it's absolutely hilarious to watch on screen .    dudley moore is great here in this film as arthur ,  earning an oscar nomination and golden globe win for his performance .  moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film ,  turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comedic gold ,  but he is also great in bringing arthur down to a relatable level and making the character likable .  moore has some help in the co-star department - liza minnelli is great as lina ,  the spirited nobody who arthur can't get enough of ,  and john gielgud is terrific as arthur's butler hobson .  gielgud won the best supporting actor oscar for his performance in this film ,  and there's no doubting why .  hobson has a stone-solid dry wit and stuck up attitude ,  but he's always looking out for arthur - and gielgud is perfect in the role .  steve gordon's 1981 film arthur is short and simple ,  but delivers laughs a-plenty . 
i'm a huge fan of the twin sisters .  although this was one of their  " not soo good "  movies .  i'm not saying it's bad ,  i can't say it's bad ,  but this whole popular and not popular thingy isn't good .  although i give this movie a 4 . 
i gotta say ,  clive barker's undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made .  i've played resident evil ,  silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements .  barker is good at what he does ,  which is attach the horror to our world ,  and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game .  heck ,  even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters .  full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at ,  undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title .  i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud . 
this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing  " sandy "  and the agnes moorhead-and-the-tiny-spacemen episodes .   it is an important take ,  from mid-1961 ,  on the long cold war that the u . s .  was then embroiled in .  the beaten-down city-scene ,  the near-starving characters' sparse dialog ,  their threadbare uniforms ,  and the minimal action  " says "  it all :  the absurdity of an on-going conflict that threatens to destroy human life ,  modern civilization ,  and all that is sweet and redeeming about it .   it is a  " fable "  because it was made in a time in which ,  had events turned out differently ,  such as the second berlin crisis  ( spring 1961 )  and the subsequent cuban missile crisis  ( oct .  1962 )  ,  it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u . s . 's major cities ,  ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors .  i also see it as a  " fable "  because it is not only a cautionary tale ,  but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths :  it is a love story ,  set in an impossible situation ,  and involving two highly mismatched lovers . 
modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake ,   " the money pit .  "  older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia :  cary grant ,  myrna loy ,  and melvyn douglas were all  " superstars "  in an easier ,  less complicated era .  or was it ?  time ,  of course ,  has a way of modifying perspectives ,  and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary ,  there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older ,  seemingly less provocative films .  in  " mr .  blandings builds his dream house ,  "  there may ,  therefore ,  be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 .  there is political commentary ,  however subtle .  finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience ,  only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like .  politics in the movie ?  the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school  ( which in real life would get teachers accused of communism )  .  in real life ,  too ,  myrna loy was a housing activist ,  a democrat ,  and a feminist .  melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand :  he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas ,  whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism  ( and which ruined her )  .  jason robards ,  sr .  ,  has a small role in the film ,  but his political activism was no less noticeable .  more importantly ,  his son ,  jason robards ,  jr .  ,  would be for many years a very active liberal democrat .  almost the odd fellow out was cary grant ,  whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping .  but this was 1948 :  communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner .  it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films ,  and then not so subtly . 
for a long time i haven't seen so beautiful animated feature .  having healthy respect for pixar ,  i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by 'em can not be compared to this .  animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here .  the graphics is amazing ,  the background surroundings are mind-blowing ,  almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly .  sometimes i felt tingles down my spine - so much i loved what i've seen .   the plot is absolutely romantic .  as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be .  the characters are lovable ,  especially hector ,  the blue rabbit ,  he owns ,  pawns ,  rocks and rules !  the other char-s are very nice also .  the humor is top-notch .   generally it seemed that creators didn't invest much effort into this .  i mean it looked like it didn't take em too much in difference from people of pixar&dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new .  and i'm very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great .  they've made a magnificent ,  touching movie ,  a candy for eye and heart .   the only minus is stupid beginning and that's why it's 9of10 not 10/10
i was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 .  the premise was very simple and appealing :  each episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by a famous ,  noteworthy horror director .  then ,  when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown .  some good episodes emerged from that first season ,  but all in all it was a mixed bag .  i attributed it to the learning curve ,  and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better .   boy ,  was i in for a shock .  at least season one had a few good stories here and there .  season 2  ( with the exception of  " the black cat "  starring the excellent jeffrey combs )  was a complete and total loss to me .  the episode  " sounds like "  may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last 10 years ,  and most of the other episodes aren't much better .  i really hope that season 3 turns this around next year ,  but i'm not holding my breath . 
by all accounts ,  this could have been an interesting film .  featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth ,  starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as  " the future of british horror "  ,  i expected alex chandon's gore fest to live up to the hype .   i was wrong .   everything about this film is either cliche or inept .  the short story anthology setup was done to death  ( and much better )  in the seventies and eighties .  admittedly ,  the idea of 'the sick room' did send a chill down my spine ,  but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting .   chandon cannot write dialogue .  every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence  ( the typical 'cop on the edge' formula .  funny ,  i'm sure i've seen that somewhere else before .  .  .  )  no chandon ,  you are not tarantino .  or scorsese .  it sounds bad .  add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting  ( don't get me wrong ,  dani filth is a great singer and musician ,  but actor he ain't )  and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing .  give me bruce campbell any day .   the visual effects are on the whole poor ,  with some atrocious cgi ,  awful gore effects  ( for goodness sakes ,  peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget )  and editing filters that shriek over-use !  as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth's score .  .  .  man ,  they should sue .   the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously ,  trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience .  too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects  ( eg :  maniac ,  zombie flesh eaters ,  the beyond ,  suspiria etc )  ,  rendering cradle of fear ,  in my mind ,  second-rate and obsolete .   i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares .   better luck next time . 
 " dracula ii : ascension "  is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of dracula . when a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students $30 million to harvest the body and steal its blood for auction , it's an offer they can hardly refuse . soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the vatican !  " dracula ii : ascension "  is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws . the characters are one-dimensional and the acting is pretty average . there are some good gore effects like really cool double decapitation scene , but there is not enough violence for my liking . the film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense . so if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look . i prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from 60's and early 70's like  " lips of blood "  ,  " the brides of dracula "  or  " lemora : a child's tale of supernatural "  to name only a few . 4 out of 10 . 
edward montagne's tattooed stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor .  instead ,  it's a poorly acted ,  witless look into low budget and uninspired film making .  the plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish .  john miles ,  who had a rather thin resume in the industry ,  grins and guffaws throughout ,  and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government-made filmstrip about driver safety .  the movie anticipates shows like 'leave it to beaver' and 'father knows best' in its unnaturally wholesome view of new york in 1950 .  why ,  the viewer doesn't even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie .  the only thing the movie has going for it  ( besides its brevity )  is the excellent location shots coordinated by william steiner .  the low budget of the film works in the cinematographer's favor ,  as the viewer is treated to well-framed shots of new york city's interiors and expansive exteriors .  unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles ,  i suggest watching practically any other movie . 
 .  .  .  and in *no way* as clean ,  logical ,  and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches .   i'm 27 ,  and i've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations .  like the main character in the film ,  i was successful mainly because of logic  :  because i kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality ,  and to know what was really going on and what wasn't .  in the end ,  i was really successful because of medication ,  by the way ,  but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't .   so ,  i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud .  not only does it cheat with the main character's story  ( who wasn't faithful to his wife ,  who was bisexual - something really important here )  ,  but mostly ,  it shows a comforting ,  tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point .   schizophrenia is a mind structure ,  not a disease .  a schizophrenic *isn't* a  " normal man with a disease "  ,  it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people  :  for him ,  things like time ,  space ,  and people's personalities aren't solid things .  he feels it can be bent ,  it can change ,  it can mutate ,  and maybe even disappear .  to cope with this ,  a schizophrenic has a rich ,  very imaginative inner world which  " normal "  people don't expect - but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people ,  and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank ,  delusive dead end .   this is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous  " cure "  ,  tear-jerking movie .  it should be violently frightening .  people other than the main character should appear strange ,  weird and absurd ,  like in lynch's  " eraserhead "  ,  for example .  there should be *really* impressive ,  weird ,  gross hallucinations ,  because that's what schizophrenia is all about .  it's not about *details* .   i mean ,  watch  " naked lunch "  ,   " lost highway "  ,  read p . k .  dick's  " martian time-split "  or  " ubik "  ,  do watch  " the cell "  ,   " perfect blue "  ,   " dark city "  ,  or play  " american mcgee's alice "  on pc ,  and you may have a vague idea of what it's like .  don't watch the  " feel good "  movie of the month ,  with banal situations ,  cleaned characters and visuals ,  and stupid plot tricks .   " the cell "  is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind ,  his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent ,  weird ,  confusing ,  and very ,  very scary .   once again ,  schizophrenia isn't about details ,  it's not a neat ,  tame trick played to you .  it jumps in your face and won't let you go  :  walls fall apart ,  people turn into strange hostile creatures ,  you feel like you go backward in time ,  you're not sure you're who you think you are ,  everything feels .  .  .  strange ,  unnatural .  believe me ,  this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap-like melodrama
bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan ,  an average man who feels god is messing up his life .  god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways .  of course ,  giving someone god's powers could take a turn for the worse .  bruce almighty is a good comedy ,  jim carrey is good ,  as always morgan freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well .  the jokes are almost always on target ,  although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey's facial expressions .  i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god ,  not only that but also as a black man .  i thought this quite well ,  especially with the brilliant freeman .  there are some hilarious scenes ,  the opening cookie scene for instance ,  others miss the target slightly but still a good film .  6/7 out of 10
 .  .  . cause they're both pretty lousy .  i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs .  she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture ,  rip someone to bloody pieces ,  and calmly re-enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened .  now ,  you know a movie's in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention .   i admit ,  i paid $30 for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie .  i know what you're thinking--30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole .  and you would be absolutely correct .  this movie sucks .  there ,  it's right out in the open .  i was expecting some actual scares ,  and i waited and waited and waited .  none came .  the raven  ( probably a crow in makeup )  didn't scare me ,  seeing small pieces of internal organs didn't scare me ,  and even faye didn't scare me .  i'm not that brave ,  i know ,  so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble .  what's more ,  jennifer wasn't scared either .  her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything .  her life was rapidly coming to a close and she's worried about attaining more money .  honey ,  you can't take money where you're going !  !  !   " i need money ,  "  she continually says ,  completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function .   meanwhile ,  i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother  ( faye )  .  i was suspicious at first ,  faye playing a grandmother and all ,  and i was still suspicious at the end .  there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother-from-hell are forced to share temporarily ,  and i'm guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother .  here's the weird part--the relative looks like she's just endured her eight hundredth birthday party .  mary ellen looks like she's just gotten a face-lift from a renowned surgeon .  face-lifts can't work miracles ,  but i think faye's appearance is important to the rice-paper plot .  spoiler !  !  !  it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting .  .  . sorry ,  my little joke .  seriously though ,  there's all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate .  yuck ,  huh ?  interestingly enough ,  mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact .  how did she avoid the family curse ?  something's up with her ,  obviously .   another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars--this movie features one of my all-time movie pet peeves .  i refer to the double ending .  this movie ends twice .  i absolutely hate it when that happens ,  and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending ,  didn't like it ,  and forget to remove it during editing .  i guess it's supposed to be scary ,  but it is only if you're a film editor .   there is one perk to this debacle ,  though ,  and it's one of the reasons i bought the dvd .  the  " filmmaker "  commentary features faye dunaway ,  and i wanted to see how she acted when she didn't have lines to recite .  guess what--the movie sucked so bad i wasn't able to sit through it again .  drat . 
i finally caught up to  " starlight "  last night on television and all i can say is .   .   .  wow !  it's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects  ( check out the laser beams shooting out of willie's eyes !  )  ,  the atrocious acting ,  the ponderous dialogue ,  the mismatched use of stock footage ,  or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production .  this truly is a one-of-a-kind experience ,  and we should all be thankful for that .  i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood ! 
brando plays the ace jet pilot ,  just back from shooting migs down in the korean war .  on leave ,  he discovers his madame butterfly ,  falls in love .  the lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relations .   this film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist ,  conservative standards ,  dominant at the time it was made in 1957 .   " sayonara "  will make you laugh and cry .  beware though ,  sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there ,  although ,  irving berlin's title song will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again . 
a bunch of american students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of ireland in order to study ancient religious practices .  despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of straying off the beaten path  ( by the local creepy irish guy ,  natch )  ,  they do just that ,  and wind up with their insides on the outside courtesy of a family of inbred cannibals  ( the descendants of the infamous sawney bean clan ,  who according to the film's silly plot ,  upped sticks from scotland and settled on the emerald isle )  .   if you think that porn stars plus low budget horror automatically equals tons of nudity and terrible acting ,  then think again :  evil breed is bristling with adult stars ,  but in fact ,  there's not nearly as much nudity as one might expect given the 'talent' involved ,  and the acting ,  although far from oscar worthy ,  ain't all that bad  ( with the exception of ginger lynn allen ,  who we know can do marvellous 'french' ,  but whose irish is lousy )  .   evil breed opens in superb style with the brutal slaughter of a couple of amorous campers :  after some brief under-canvas sex ,  the silicone enhanced hottie is dragged from the tent and torn in half ;  the guy has his arms and legs cut off and is roasted on a spit .  it's a very gory start ,  and bodes well for the rest of the film .   unfortunately ,  after this promising beginning ,  things start to go seriously downhill :  we are introduced to the main characters ,  an annoying bunch of twenty-somethings just begging to become cannibal chow ,  and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares ,  a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local irish weirdo gary  ( simon peacock )  ,  and worst of all ,  some sub-scream ,  post-modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films  ( how clever !  )  .   then ,  just as it looks as though the film is never going to get any better ,  director christian viel decides to get serious :  a guy gets a knife rammed through his head and there's a gratuitous sex-in-the-shower scene featuring lovely blonde gillian leigh  ( not a porn star ,  but i'm sure there's a career there waiting if she wants it )  .  after that ,  things improve rapidly as the cannibals kick into top flesh-eating gear ,  and the film is transformed into a veritable bloodbath :  gary has a machete rammed up his ass  ( about time !  )  ,  and is strangled with his intestines ;  ginger lynn kick-boxes a mutant ;  jenna jameson is torn open ,  eviscerated and has her silicone breast implant gnawed on by confused cannibal ;  a guy gets decapitated by cheese wire ;  and taylor hayes is seen bloody ,  bruised and naked with a dead foetus between her legs  ( apparantly ,  she's been captured and used as breeding stock )  .   all of this is so outrageously gory that it makes sitting through the less interesting stuff worthwhile ,  and earns evil breed a final rating of 7/10 .   nb .  a very troubled production and studio meddling resulted in christian viel eventually abandoning the project .  re-shoots were done and the gore was heavily trimmed for a us release .  the good news is that although the film doesn't flow as well as it might have ,  and is cursed with a terrible ending ,  the uk dvd  ( the version i watched )  seems to have been left relatively intact as far as the splatter is concerned  ( only 13s were cut from the film in total )  . 
although this film was made before dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking ,  and before digital triumphed over -- strike that .  you get the point .  this 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments .  corin nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator .  the pace is slow ,  but elegantly so ,  because the cinematography is so beautiful .  record it the next time its on t . v .  ,  because i guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia rip-off made-for- t . v .  movie .  direct-to-video never felt so good ! 
disney  ( and the wonderful folks at pixar of course )  offer a nice ,  humourous story combined with the best of computer animation .  i admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'antz' and they only had four legs  ( in 'antz' six .  .  .  )  .  but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking .  but let this be a lesson :  it was not the computer who made it such a success  :  it was the man behind the machine ,  who added the nice little twists ,  which i missed in 'antz' .  some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end  ( so keep watching at the end ,  it's worth it !  )  ,  which were highly amusing and original .  the line 'filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer . 
during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn ,  where do we go from here ?  was finally unearthed for a screening .  it is amazing that a motion picture ,  from any era ,  that has weill-gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens .  the score stands tall ,  and a cd of the material ,  with gershwin and weill ,  only underscores its merits ,  which are considerable .  yes ,  the film has its problems ,  but the score is not one of them .  ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy ,  and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material .  then ,  too ,  the 'modern' segment is weakly written .  but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark ,  as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies - joan leslie and june haver .  both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work .  as a world war ii salute to our country's history - albeit in a 'never was' framework ,  the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits . 
merry madcaps in london stage a treasure hunt ,  with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong ,  independent lady-flier who's never been in love .  intriguing early vehicle for katharine hepburn ,  playing an amelia earhart-like aviatrix who's been too self-involved to give herself over to any man .  the director  ( dorothy arzner )  and the screenwriter  ( zoe akins ,  who adapted gilbert frankau's book )  were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view ,  but why are all the old clichés kept intact like frozen artifacts ?  billie burke plays the type of simpering ,  weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong ,  and hepburn's final scene is another bummer .  a curious artifact ,  but not a classic for kate-watchers .  ** from ****
strangely erotic schlock gothic horror that will be loved by hammer house of horror fans the world over .  appears to be an interesting take on  " beauty and the beast "  .  it is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era .   corsets ,  castles ,  rutting horses ,  rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods ,  proof that no-one had a brazilian in the 70's ,  and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at ,  what more could you possibly want ?  !   it certainly brightened my sunday afternoon ! 
once in a while ,  a movie will sweep along that stuns you ,  draws you in ,  awes you ,  and ,  in the end ,  leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form .  this is not it .  this is an action movie that lacks convincing action .  it stinks .  rent something else . 
now this is what i'd call a good horror .  with occult/supernatural undertones ,  this nice low-budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene .  this proves you don't need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie .   the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison ,  and each of these characters  ( and their motives )  become gradually more interesting ,  as the movie builds up tension to the finale .  most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere ,  who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates .   i won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen .  there a few flaws though :  the fx are not that good ,  but they're used effectively ;  the plot leaves some mysteries open ;  and things get very confusing towards the end ,  but malefique redeems itself by the time it's over .   i thought his was a very good movie ,  8/10
i couldn't agree more with another reviewer that mentioned jodorowsky .   barney seems to be utterly boring and uninspired  " content-wise "  .  he can produce eye-candy  ( and i like candy )  ,  but its pretentiousness and fundamental artistic emptiness just diminishes all the joy .    i am afraid that many people don't distinguish between similar  ( but really only on the surface )  works of jodorowsky or even more linear film-makers like tarkovski or kubrick  ( i love 2001 odyssey and was never bored through the ending scenes .  .  .  )  that kind of art as m . barney's makes adds confusion and fends off the viewers that could otherwise start to appreciate experimental cinema .  typical empty post-modern  " conceptual "  art .  and check his interviews .  i just don't buy it ,  sorry .  and so boring .    i was never bored seeing alejandro jodorowsky's movies ,  while drawing restraint 9 was an utter disappointment .  especially while it offered the possibilities to be something ,  to actually tell something in a non-linear unorthodox way  ( like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and preparations for the ship to sail out .  ships  " meeting "  on the sea .  .  .  ideas of feces as an object of value ( if it was feces )  .  those  " pearl "  divers .  .  .  everything could construct a great surreal movie with some content .  but it didn't .  and those horrible pretentious scenes of dressing up and fake tea ceremony .  .  .  how vain and fake and philosophically pretentious but empty can it get ?   i has some great picturesque scenes ,  but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and utterly empty and fake that it made me physically sick .   and it doesn't have good tempo .  i like slow pace movies ,  but this was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and fake - so i was just forced to witnessed prolonged scenes of artistic vanity .  .  .   that kind of movies just kill the art and spirit in my view .    i want more jodorowsky !  !  ! 
i think that movie can`t be a scott`s film .  that is impossible .  do you remember blade runner ?  and alien ?  two greats movies versus a one .  i hope didn´t see ever it .  good bye !  ! 
i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival .  sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin .  being a devout fan of lewis carroll's 'alice' books i was very excited about this movie's premier ,  which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch .  normally i'm enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well .  usually it's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story .  unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion .  the adaptation of the original's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying .  it probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either .  most performances were ridiculously over the top ,  which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script .  i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film .  all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by .  really ,  the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice ,  but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman's work .  also ,  i'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful .  it was with out a doubt the low point of the film .   what a joke .  don't see this movie .  after its conclusion i was genuinely angry . 
it is obviously illegal .  pedophiles pray on stuff like this .  how did they get away with making such a movie ?  this movie is all summed up in one word ,  sick .  where do people get off making ,  and watching these kinds of films .  as i was watching the movie i didn't actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman .  sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this .  where has the sanity of these people gone ?  maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles ?  our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children ,  yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior .  i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked .  this is a kid here ,  and someone is asking something like this ?  what is wrong with this picture ? 
you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years ,  right ?  i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an island ,  but you'd think that after watching unkempt ,  stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original  ( and interesting )  .   and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable .  it's just hard to suspend disbelief for  " bushy bill "  eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy .   what's the appeal here ?  i don't care about these people or their meandering lives .  i just don't get it .  but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy ,  unwashed people ,  i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat .  they call them homeless people ,  and free of charge ,  you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters ,  eventually striking  " pay-dirt "  and fashioning a homemade dr .  frankenstein-styled cancer-stick ,  all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of  " aqua velva "  on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise .  and the best part ?  much like survivor ,  every week one member of the tribe  " leaves "  the  " island "  when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks into gear !  now that's entertainment ! 
more a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged out biopic ,  this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie-type film .  i think the tendency would be to portray bettie page as some sort of sex vixen ,  like a jayne mansfield .  but if you've truly looked carefully at bettie's poses ,  she always looked happy .  not a  " you wish you could get with me "  haughty look ,  nor the  " i'm just doing this because my acting career didn't work out "  look of a porn star .  and so ,  the ladies involved with this film  ( three female producers ,  a female writer/ director ,  female co-writer and the lovely gretchen mol ,  who i'm sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence )  really captured the idea of a sweet ,  somewhat naive ,  southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol' jc wouldn't be too upset with her .    gretchen mol turns out a career high performance  ( she may just have the most perfect breasts ever )  ,  which i am happy about ,  because she did have the curse .  several years ago ,  she made the cover of vanity fair when no one really knew who she was ,  touting her as the next it-girl .  and let's be frank ,  that was a bit presumptuous .  i mean unfortunately she has never made it to gwyneth status ,  though not for lack of talent .  making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in fickle hollywood renders you forgettable i'm afraid .  if this doesn't put her back on the a-list ,  well i'll be a monkey's uncle .   intensely private ,  bettie herself has not seen the film yet .  bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame ,  jesus .  whatever floats your boat honey .  you were one helluva woman .  i hope you're happy wherever you are .   congratulations mary harron ,  you've done our cult idol justice . 
having seen and loved greg lombardo's most recent film  " knots "   ( he co-wrote and directed that feature as well )  ,  i decided to check out his earlier work ,  and this movie was well worth the effort and rental .  macbeth in manhattan is a tongue in cheek ,  excellent take on the shakespeare favorite ,  updated and moved to nyc .  i was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself - and very cleverly at that .  the trials and tribulations of life in manhattan parallel many a shakespeare play ,  and central park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around macbeth's castle .  mr .  lombardo obviously has a fond place in his heart for new york and new york stories  ( knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty-something new yorkers set primarily in a charming brooklyn neighborhood ,  with manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown in for good measure )  and has spent considerable time around the plays of shakespeare .  the movie is well-paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of macbeth .  it reminded me of al pacino's  " looking for richard "  - another wonderful shakespeare  " play within a movie .  "  i highly recommend checking out macbeth in manhattan . 
i had numerous problems with this film .   it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics ,  which is fine .  although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years ,  the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying :   " aren't you just blown away by this !  "  well ,  not really .  these aren't earth shattering revelations anymore .  at any rate ,  i was already familiar with quantum theory ,  and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations ,  etc .  is not new .   the main problem i have with this movie ,  however ,  is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism .  i don't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism ,  but quantum mechanics doesn't really have anything to do with these things ,  and it should be kept separate .  the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you ,  hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better .  the reasoning is completely ridiculous ,  and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory .  for every so called  " expert "  that they interviewed for this film ,  there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree .  they would point out ,  quite rightly ,  that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness .   it disturbs me that people are going to see this film and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling .  the main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory ,  and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments .   avoid this film .   oh yeah .  at one point ,  one of the  " experts "  says that since throughout history most of the assumptions people have made about the world turned out to be false ,  therefore the assumptions we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false .  huh ?  that totally does not follow .  and even if it did ,  i don't see how that helps his argument .  i mean ,  if his ideas ever became common assumptions then i guess we would have to assume that they are false too ,  based on his own reasoning . 
a stale  " misfits-in-the-army "  saga ,  which half-heartedly attempts to be both surreal  ( the foreign subtitles )  and vulgar  ( the flatulence gags )  ,  but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor ,  none of them followed very successfully .  barbara bach ,  the bond girl from  " the spy who loved me "  ,  has only two or three brief scenes .  what a waste !   ( *1/2 ) 
i don't know what you guys are talking about ,  the first time i watched this movie with two of my friends we couldn't stop crying .  this is one of the funniest shits i've ever seen .  that comment about the porn is so right though hahahaha .   yeah this movie actually is the worse ,  but it did bring tears to my eyes due to the phony characters ,  poor dialog and acting .  not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it ?  !  it looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed .  class .  the props look like they came out of a high school drama show .  the music sounds like it is from an original nintendo system game .  the only thing that even came close the scaring me about this movie was that it had a killer clown which ,  who isn't creeped out by fat ,  lurking clowns ?  hahaha if someone were to ever watch this though ,  they need to look out for the actors verbal errors like lisping on words and some of their facial expressions .  hahahaha i died .   susan
i run a group to stop comedian exploitation and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for ,   " last comic standing .  "  if they don't have a good agent ,  then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80% of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent !  if they do make it to an audition ,  i was told that it's  " pre-determined "  if they get a second chance .  so what the tv audience sees is not the best comics in the us .   if the comics do make it to the show ,  then most of them don't get imdb credits .  i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of ,   " last comic standing "  and i don't get paid for doing the producers' job .  it's really a disgrace .  a month ago ,  i asked ,   " last comic standing 7 "  on facebook why the producers aren't giving imdb credits and i was banned from their facebook page !  !  !  i am not a comedian so i do not have a personal stake in this .  i just want people to know the truth .  i don't like seeing anyone getting exploited and that's why i've been helping the comedians .  comedians get exploited on hbo ,  bet ,  tvone and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen .   please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized :  http : //www . youtube . com/watch ? v=rmb4-hyet_y
heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux pas :  it's desperate to teach us a civics lesson ,  and it won't stop until we've passed the final exam .  fibber mcgee and molly take a trip to washington ,  where they see the senate in action  ( or inaction ,  if you prefer )  ,  have a spat with their senator  ( eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career )  ,  get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children ,  and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace .  henry wallace !  !  a year later ,  he was considered a near communist dupe ,  but in 1944 ,  he was a-ok .  add in some truly awful musical moments ,  a whole lot of flagwaving hooey ,  and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters ,  and you've got a film that must have had philip wylie ready to pen generation of vipers 2 :  d . c .  boogaloo .  drastically unfun ,  heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes . 
this movie was horrible .  i could barely stay awake through it .  i would never see this movie again if i were payed to .  the so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played .  there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $7 . 50 i payed to see it .  don't go see it ,  don't rent it ,  don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time .  sarah michelle geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie .  shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible ,  horrible movie .  horrible movie ,  no need to ever see it . 
this movie was not made by who fans .  most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over :  in christmas ,  they didn't show daltry's screams after the line  " tommy doesn't know what day it is .  .  .  "  ,  they showed almost *no* townsend guitar shots in pinball wizard ,  there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of go to the mirror ,  and worst of all ,  in the second half of we're not gonna take it  ( listening to you )  ,  they robbed us of almost every shot of pete's blazing guitar chords .  huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band .  it's a very frustrating film to watch ,  and doesn't deliver the goods .  i don't know if director murry lerner is just not a who fan ,  or worse ,  for him at least ,  if he *is* a who fan and this is all the *eight* cameras could deliver for him .  to its credit ,  there are some rare numbers before tommy ,  as well as some faves ,  that are very well shot ,  and sometimes the editing is brilliant .  this might be enough to make some viewers happy ,  as long as you're not anticipating tommy .  the sound overall was mediocre in the transmission i watched from directv ;  it may be different on video or dvd . 
this is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time .  it has all the right ingredients - a mystery corpse ,  a weary middle-aged cop corrigan  ( walter kinsella )  and his rookie sidekick tobin  ( john miles )  ,  a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the tobin in the shape of a female botanist mary  ( patricia wright )  who helps solve the crime .  there's also a terrific shoot-out finale which takes place in a stone cutters yard .   watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where lt .  corrigan refers to the dead woman as 'tatooed tilly' before the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo  ( confusing huh ?  )  .  also later when tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he didn't catch him ! 
first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman .  in this film ,  you will not see a single sailing boat .  you will not see sailors ,  ghosts ,  or anything remotely exciting .  it is not the story of the ghost ship ,  and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i wouldn't have watched it ,  because i really thought it was the film about the legend .  it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship ,  since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the  " flying dutchman "  legend .  .  .  i don't understand why .  it is maybe based on the resembling legend called  " the wandering jew "  ?  or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend ?  the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes .  unfortunately ,  it is the only battle scene of the film .  then you see daniel emilfork  ( who was krank in city of lost children )  for about two seconds ,  and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting .  unfortunately he is very bad in the film .  the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi ,  who was one of italia's best actors ever ,  and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the  " wise man "  of the film .  and boy ,  does that film need wiseness !  every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement ,  yelling ,  torturing others  ( in excrement )  ,  fornicating  ( in excrement )  or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it .  it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another .  coming from a dutch director ,  you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece ,  elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven's film ,   " flesh + blood "  ,  such a great film .  the thought of  " flesh + blood "  would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good .  unfortunately ,  and unlike  " flesh + blood "  ,  there is no dramatic progression ,  no fights ,  no good acting ,  and put simply ,  no  " flesh and blood "  .  the photography ,  as the opening sequence unfolds ,  is well-done and enticing .  this too ,  stops very early in the film .  the music ,  from nicola piovani  ( of  " la vità e bella "  fame )  is repetitive and annoying ,  when not irrelevant  ( it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence ,  while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung )  .  throughout the first  " act "  of the film ,  which lasts nothing less than an hour  (  !  )  ,  the film takes place within the same perimeter ,  which is around the farm where the main characters live .  the characters play with excrement a lot ,  drown in it ,  play in it .  a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character ,  a young boy who loves to play in excrement ,  to become older and play in excrement some more .  the bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian .  spanish conquistadors speak french .  nothing makes sense .  everything is confused and takes hours to happen .  then there is a second act called  " the ship "  ,  in which we see what might have been a ship ,  a long time ago ,  but which is now remains of a ship  ( covered with excrement did i mention ?  )  .  the main character ,  while walking a bit further away from the farm ,  just happens to run into it ,  and decides it's really cool so let's live in it .  the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him ,  but he doesn't really mind because  ( did i mention ?  )  he's not very bright .  he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it ,  until more conquistadors show up  ( at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i've said it's really confused who's who )  ,  make the dutchman a prisoner ,  along with the retarded hunchback ,  and they burn the ship to the ground .  the last part of the film ,  which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it ,  takes place in a mad asylum .  yet more torture and drowning each other with feces .  yet more loitering for the director ,  who seems to have definitely given up on his job ,  or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job .  in the end ,  a lot of the mentally-challenged new  " friends "  that the dutchman made die .  the woman he had sex with who was his brother's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son .  the dutchman and his son talk .  the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances .  then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends ,  while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don't have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses . 
just the fact that the cover is a drawing ,  like those old b-movies should give you a warning about the quality of this movie .  this is ,  however not a b-movie .  it is a d-movie !    there are no known actors ,  and the animals - wow - it is the worst data-animation ever made during the last two decades .    you hardly ever see the scaaary sabretooth shown on the front cover .  you just hear people scream ,  bleed and die and you occasionally see a teeth or a tiger-paw .  it's so amateur !  maybee worth seeing ,  just because it's so bad .  give it to a friend and say :   " this is the best movie i have ever seen ,  and wait for their reaction "  he ,  he .    the movie is to weak to give it a spoiler alert !  this is a spoiler . 
this docu-drama is what you would expect from richard attenborough ,  the man who gave us  " gandhi "  :  beautifully photographed ,  compellingly casted ,  well written in the measured ,  literate manner that hollywood discarded in the 30's ,  and scrupulously accurate .  it stands out as a genre film ,  excelling in its portrayal of native american  ( or ,  more appropriately for its canadian setting ,   " first nations "  )  culture and standing with  " black robe "  as a wonderfully photographed piece of canoe country and its culture  ( here ,  circa 1934 )  .  this idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject :  archie  " grey owl "  belaney ,  a scot raised in hastings  ( england )  by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the  " red indian "  tales of his childhood that he went to canada ,  disappeared into the woods ,  and became a trapper and adopted son of an ojibway band .  he was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning  indian brides ,  none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it ,  for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character .  one of his wives  ( one smarter than he ,  by most accounts )  propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the north ,  and this forms the focus of attenborough's tale .  the chemistry between brosnan and annie galipeau  ( as grey owl's wife pony )  is engaging and ,  if not firey ,  is nonetheless quite touching .  a good film when you need some time from the madding crowd . 
i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a writer/director .  i could not have been more disappointed by this move .  the movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall .  the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent .  not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr .  hopkins falls into this category .  of all the movies i have ever seen in my 50 years ,  this is absolutely the worst movie ever .  please do us all a favor mr .  hopkins and stick to acting ,  which you are excellent at ,  and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas .  if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would . 
sex wish was actually released  ( minus ten minutes of more ,  ahem ,  'extreme' footage )  here in the uk back in the early days of the video boom ,  and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case .  strangely enough ,  the papers brushed this ultra-disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of frozen scream and night of the demon canned ,  and the film has been all but forgotten as a result .  i jumped at the chance to watch it on a dvd-rw and spent most of the film's duration with my jaw on the floor .  it's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented ,  a triple-x take on michael winner's death wish  ( did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned ?  )  with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze .  if you don't consider yourself to be squeamish ,  this may force you to think again .  by the time sex wish is over ,  you'll want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself .  if any film truly deserves the  " it's only a movie ,  only a movie ,  only a movie "  tag-line ,  it's this one .   highlights  ( or lowlights )  - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her ,  harry reems's scene-stealing moustache ,  the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer  ( they'd have won oscars for their entirely credible performances if the academy had gone mad )  before the man is castrated for his troubles ,  and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind-house origins .  don't say i didn't warn you .  if you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago ,  sex wish will prove you very ,  very wrong . 
if my expectations weren't exceeded ,  they were certainly met .   " nancy drew "  works both as a mystery and a comedy .  it pays homage to the books it was based on and spoofs them at the same time .  the movie starts with a close-up on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling illustrations from the books .  it then begins lampooning the books immediately .  writer/director andrew fleming seems to realize the idea of a teenage girl regularly breaking up crime rings in a small town is ridiculous ,  so he doesn't treat the idea religiously .  he pokes fun at nancy drew's ability to do anything ,  such as ace every class in school ,  know which baked treat is perfect for converting any enemy to her side ,  make a bird house with twelve flying buttresses ,  and even perform an emergency tracheotomy at a party .  nancy'd always be in perfect style ,  if she were living in the wholesome 1950's instead of present day l . a .  and she carries around a  " sleuth kit "  complete with fingerprinting dust ,  flashlight ,  compass ,  and magnifying glass .  preposterous ,  of course ,  but i seem to remember the hardy boys' access at any given moment to csi equipment being a little too convenient as well .  and if the perky pipsqueak private eye is a little younger than her literary counterpart ,  it's just more comedic exaggeration on the movie's part .   the mystery of the movie is handled more seriously .  nancy and her lawyer father move from their small town to los angeles ,  where nancy digs into a cold case involving the murder of a hollywood movie star who lived in her new house decades ago .  nancy searches for clues in some pretty practical ways ,  such as surfing websites like google and this one and watching old videotapes of the victim's movies .  when she does something more out of the ordinary ,  you have to admire the girl's resourcefulness .  emma roberts ,  an undeniably cute kid ,  plays the pint-sized amateur sleuth beautifully .  she makes the too-perfect girl completely lovable ,  if not completely realistic .  tate donovan is also great as the too-perfect girl's father ,  carson drew .  he's an ideal father figure without being unrealistically perfect ,  and he shows reasonable concern for his daughter as she gets into danger .  less likable is max thierot's take on ned nickerson ,  nancy's boyfriend .  i much preferred george o'hanlon jr . 's portrayal in the 1970's tv series starring pamela sue martin as nancy drew ,  in which ned was a gawky ,  awkward kid with a little crush on nancy .  the character of corky  ( josh flitty )  ,  a twelve-year old with a crush on nancy ,  is much less annoying than max thierot's ned .  amy bruckner and kay panabaker seem appropriately cast as nancy's gal pals bess and george ,  but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the film .   speaking of cameos ,  chris kattan  ( snl )  ,  eddie jemison  (  " ocean's 13 "  )  ,  and bruce willis all make surprise guest appearances ,  which just proves you never can guess which movie bruce willis will pop up in next .   the movie does fail to live up to some potential .  it's mentioned early on that the drews' new house is heavily booby-trapped ,  but nancy and her father are done with tripping over booby traps a few minutes after that .  also ,  nancy describes the cold case she's about to investigate as a murder taking place at an extravagant party ,  which should yield plenty of potential murderers ,  but she only encounter a handful of suspects .  and while there's some moments of real suspense during nancy's adventures ,  the solution to the case comes out of nowhere ,  and in the end all possible plot threads are tied up too conveniently and who-cares-who-done-it .  ralph sall's score adds to the movie's suspense ,  but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame .  still ,  i really enjoyed this film ,  and while the movie is aimed primarily at tween girls ,  people of any age and gender can enjoy it . 
interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to .  however ,  i'll try .  this was a very good action film with some great set pieces .  you'll note i specified the genre .  i didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation ,  and i didn't berate the acting .  enjoy if for what it is people ,  a well above average action film .  i could go on but i've made my comment . 
normally i would have given this movie a 6 .  it tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well - despite katie wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself .   i have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating ,  but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for lexi .  there's no dimension to her other than how confused ,  helpless and clueless she is ,  and how good she is at whimpering .  i can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught ,  scared and in pain .  however ,  wright's entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling ,  the rest being whining .  i couldn't help but feel this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon that is bulimia ,  but by her not having a backbone .  i very much doubt that's the point the movie meant to make . 
this episode introduced the holodeck to the tng world .  the jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them .  a tired picard decides to take a trip into the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins .  the settings are superb and almost movie like .  alas ,  the jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all it's safety devices stop working .  picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s america and return to the jarada rendezvous .  picard greets the jarada correctly and a new day dawns between humanity and the jarada .  this gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there
i never heard of this film til it played as part of a robert mitchum retrospective at the national film theatre in london .  almost 60 years on the cast list looked tasty to say the least with seven names - in addition to top-billed mitchum - in the public domain ;  charles mcgraw ,  not long off the killers ,  barbara bel geddes ,  long before dallas and arguably still better known as the daughter of theatre set designer norman ,  walter brennan ,  who needed no introduction ,  frank faylen ,  the sadistic male nurse in the lost weekend and the much nicer small-town mensch in it's a wonderful life ,  robert preston still a decade away from harold hill in the music man with tom tully and phyllis thaxter making up the numbers .  alas ,  most of them were wasting their time .  i looked in vain for any 'signature' scenes given that it was robert wise on bullhorn .  by this time he'd made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style .  the story is our old friend the range war and mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the hopalong cassidy oaters on which he'd cut his teeth .  there are no new twists - if you don't count the unbelievable scene when mitchum accuses preston of sleeping with thaxter to gain information about her father's plans to move his cattle .  this is perfectly true but how did mitchum know ?  we've seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it .  on balance not a lot to be said for this . 
i tried as hard as i could to sit all the way through this irritating mess ,  but i just couldn't do it .  brad dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse .    the whole thing is just ludicrous ,  from the awful acting to the laughable fx to the stupid plot .   complete waste of time ;  don't bother .  root canal therapy would be more enjoyable .  bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant .    watching a uwe boll movie would be only a little worse than this .  get the idea ? 
i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago .  then ,  the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional ,  if indeed they could ever transpire at all .  not any longer .  now ,  the politics ,  society ,  and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed .   consider the following factors ,  which were mostly absent in 1987  ( the year the running man came out )  that are present today :   concern with ,  as richard dawson's character damon killian puts it ,   " traditional morality .  "  check  entertainment in the form of extreme reality ,  including pain ,  fear ,  and discomfort on the part of contestants .  check  cameras everywhere .  check  restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government ,  controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports  (  " travel passes "  in the movie )  and sanctioned under the guise of national security .  check  an increased intermingling ,  bordering on incestuous ,  of government and media .  check  computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage  ( such as the  " digital matting "  of ben richards' image onto the stunt double )  .  check  jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration .  check  flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy ;  increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government ;  civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent .  check ,  check ,  check  then again ,  maybe it's just a movie based on a stephen king novella .  but just to be safe ,  i'm moving to switzerland . 
i can't for the life of me remember why--i must have had a free ticket or something--but i saw this movie in the theater when it was released .  i don't remember who i went with ,  which theater i was in ,  or even which city .  all i remember was how offended i was at this travesty someone dared to call a film ,  and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over .  unfortunately i stuck it out to end ,  which i still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far .  my offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says  " look for problem child 2 ,  coming soon !  "  that was hands-down the most terrifying moment ever recorded on film .   the plot ,  if i recall correctly ,  involved john ritter and perhaps his wife  ( lord ,  how i've tried without success to block this film out of my mind )  adopting a  " problem child .  "  maybe they think they can reform him ,  or something .  i really don't know .  if that was their intent ,  they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the brattiest ,  rudest ,  most horrid demon-spawn ever to hit the big screen .  forget damian ,  forget rosemary's baby .  this kid takes the cake .  the only difference is ,  we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he's a  " problem child .  "  however ,  this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed .  you want to kill him through the entire film ,  and when  ( spoiler ,  like anyone cares )  john ritter decides to keep the vile hell-child you will be yelling  " send him back !  "  in shocked disgust  ( like several of the people at the theater where i saw it did )  .   this is only the second movie i have given a  " 1 "  to on the imdb .  the other was superman iv ,  and by god i couldn't tell you which was worse .  john ritter had a quote in tv guide about the time that problem child 3 ,  which he was not in ,  came out .  he said something like  " the only way i would do another [problem child] sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform .  "  amen to that !   i would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of police academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of problem child again .  1/10 ,  only because i can't give it a negative score ,  which is what it really deserves .  someone burn the original negatives of this film ,  please ! 
this movie shows us once again ,  how genius the japanese directors are and were .  this movie could be seen as a sort of a  " silent - movie tetsuo "  .  well eisenstein .  .  .  :  ) 
cabin fever is the first feature film directed by eli roth . roth and randy pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by roth . this a zombie film , which owes a lot to george romero and his earlier  " living dead movies "  , and to the original texas chainsaw massacrenot to mention sam ramie's  " evil dead "  . there is nothing original here , and the story is not compelling . the acting is about par with this genre , it's just that the story fails . we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made . having said that , after having achieved commercial ,  if not artistic success from this movie , roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious , mean spirited , pointless ( though much more ambitious ) crap fest hostel . roth should have quit while he was behind . cabin fever is not a good film , however compared to hostel it is a work of art . i hope somebody  ( preferably a psychiatrist ) convinces this guy that film-making is the wrong career choice . as for cabin fever , a weak 3/10 for not being as abysmal as hostel . 
the kids ,  aged 7 to 14 ,  got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year .  they all loved it !  kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently ,  and we get a kick out of watching it with them .   it's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long ,  and offers laughs for the adults ,  too .  most enjoy it more than the first .   top-quality production and an excellent cast ,  led by christopher showerman as a superior george--athletic ,  energetic ,  and wholly credible ,  with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face--well supported by the inimitable christina pickles as the evil mother-in-law ,  thomas haden church as the evil jerk rival ,  and everybody else .  this is fun . 
i didn't like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s ,  so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that  " stripes "  is simply a bad movie .  well ,  the verdict is in and  " stripes "  is a bad movie .   now ,   " stripes "  may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s ,  and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans ,  but its still a bad movie .   why is it bad ?  mostly because  " stripes "  is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny .  there are some laughs ,  but they are few and far between .  most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting .  this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as  " anchorman "  which strive for laughs in every part of the movie .    " stripes "  further suffers from bill murray and harold ramis's lack of acting ability .  bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career ,  and harold ramis is playing harold ramis .  these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie .   lastly ,  most of the comedy that there is in  " stripes "  revolves around bill murray's self-centered ,  smart-alec man-child character so if you don't find that character funny  ( like i didn't )  you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in  " stripes "  funny either .    " stripes "  is very much a movie of its era ,  it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching .  if you want to watch an early 80's  " buddy "  comedy i would recommend  " stir crazy .  "  like  " stripes "  the humor in  " stir crazy "  is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies ,  but unlike  " stripes "  it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable . 
yet another forgettable warners foreign intrigue  " thriller ,  "  this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of lauren bacall ,  who ,  without humphrey bogart's tender attentions to humanize her ,  comes off as her usual shrill ,  shallow self .  even master gigolo charles boyer cannot feign romantic interest in her . 
darkman 3 :  die darkman die is directed by bradford may ,  the same guy who made the first darkman sequel too .  darkman 3 is worse than darkman 2 ,  and is nothing special ,  in my opinion .  larry drake is no more as a main villain ,  who is now played by great jeff fahey ,  whose character once again wants to get darkman's work and create this time some ultra strong humans in order to get the leadership of the whole city .  the film is pretty much the same in plot and execution as darkman 2 ,  but i was mostly irritated by the presence of many scenes from darkman 2 .  these sequels were made in short time and with little money ,  so these kind of decisions had to be made .  couple of scenes are pretty stylish and exiting ,  but still this is pretty tired film and often irritatingly stupid ,  too .  the characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying .  there is no any philosophical depth in the film ,  and this is like a remake of darkman 2 which it still cannot equal .  darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work ,  and larry drake's ability to play great villain .  darkman 3 offers only some nice scenes and moments ,  but mostly this film is tired and full of cliches .  the few positive things in this movie are flashback edits  ( westlake's nightmares )  and couple of truly surprising plot turns and tricks .  and worth mentioning is also pretty nasty death scene of the main villain which was pretty comic book like and inventive without any gore .  far more interesting than the death of main villain in part two .    darkman 3 is worst in the whole series ,  and we must remember that these two sequels were made directly to video and they don't come even close to raimi's original darkman with liam neeson .  darkman 2 was okay actioner with plenty of great scenes and suspense ,  but this last  (  ?  )  entry is tired and often stupid and boring piece of sequel .  it has some merits as mentioned ,  but overall feeling is that this should not been made in the first place .  may is talented director so hopefully he can get some more noteworthy projects in the future .   3/10
only saw this show a few times ,  but will live in my memory .    it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends !  especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guess .  .  ?   they say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the bakersfield pd themselves ?  maybe it was just too clever for certain people ?    anyhow ,  just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find .  i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network ?  but alas not over here !  !   summary :  ingenious . 
i saw this series when it world premiered at the toronto film festival .  i liked the idea behind the film ,  where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about 911 .  these directors never met before until the project was complete ,  and they saw how it looked all together .  warning :  spoilers ahead !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  all the pieces were very powerful ,  and some were controversial .  if you are an american ,  then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti-american .  however ,  i know a few americans who enjoyed these series .  the piece that i found the best was the one from india .  it was about how a muslim family ,  living in the states ,  had 2 sons ,  and one of them was missing .  the americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing .  it captures the mom's despair and humiliation of these accusations so well ,  that it brought tears to my eyes .  in the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers .  this was a true story ,  and that was what made it so real .  there were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces ,  and the african piece was one of the best .  it was humourous yet just as powerful as the others .  a must see for everyone ,  and hopefully america will unban this ,  and let it play in their country . 
this was without a doubt the worst thing i have ever spent money on .  i feel dirty for admitting that i rented this 'movie' and actually paid money to see it .  this does not even rate trash .  no no .  this is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer .  to call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere .  it was so bad i felt i had to register at imdb and warn my fellow man .  this luvahire character claims this movie is great .  one has to question his grasp on reality .  let's take some of his comments and analyze them .    " the actor who played ricky  ( i forgot his name )  did a very good job .  "   i see .  well ,  if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers ,  then yes ;  ricky did an outstanding job .    " i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off .  "   wow .  i too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes .  luvahire ,  you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these chuckleheads pulled it off .  still ,  they can help you if you need to practice crying .  just watch the movie .  ha .  ha .  ha .     " bring on the sequel "   if i was your theater teacher at school i'd fail you based solely on this comment alone .   i am too disgusted to continue .  i shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate ,  mr .  bangla .    howdy !  if you've continued to read this far ,  i take it for granted that you've already seen the movie ,  and you're now looking for one of two things in this comment :  1 )  additional vitriolic debasement of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie .  2 )  additional vitriolic debasement of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such libelous scum as myself .  whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee ,  if i say anything good it'll only disappoint you--so let me assure you ,  there is little chance of such disappointment .    the other negative comments here at imdb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie  ( e . g .  the acting ,  the soundtrack ,  the directing ,  the dialogue ,  the editing ,  etc .  )  ,  however all of these faults can readily be forgiven ,  in and of themselves .  few people will rent a movie titled  " hood of the living dead "  if they require these elements to be top-notch .  the ultimate failure of  " hood "  ,  however ,  is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name .   " hood of the living dead "  practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny one-liners and gruesomely creative kills .  here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto ,  to have gangsta-thug zombies bombin' on the innocent living while rockin' do-rags ,  to have undead pimps drivin' over all-too-mortal po-lice in their tricked-out rides .  the mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious .  instead ,  the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing ,  but don't understand .  to avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their video-rental audience ,  i suggest that the quiroz brothers re-release the movie with the following new title :   " hood of the living dead :  a home-made horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored "  .  or perhaps they could release it as a documentary .   " the day creativity died :  an exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio .  "    the potential renter whose interest has not been quelled ,  should find the following blurb on the back of the video case :   " the quiroz brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting .

this is a family film ,  which to some people is an automatic turn off .  it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs ,  gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book .  this film is none of those .  it is cliché ,  it is formula ,  but it is also fun .  it doesn't ask you to think ,  it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality .  it simply does what a good film ought to do ,  which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure .  the cast is good ,  while not excellent .  as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was ,  as usual ,  excellent .  and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable .    it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster ,  which may have played a large part in it's original theatrical opening ,  but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein .  so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy . 
along with  " king of the rocket men "  ,  this was still being repeated on bbc tv in the early to mid eighties .  if i was loading up a time capsule of this period both these series would definitely go in .   someone watching it for the first time will think it is silly but this is one of the best examples of the  " serials "  .  don del oro will make you laugh  ( when i was little my nickname for him was mr dustbin head )  and it was funny upon being shot at he says  " your bullets can't harm me "  then he stumbles back ,  seemingly less than happy .  i also like the way he dispenses with sebastian in the first episode .   i watched this again because i had good memories of it from years back ,  there are some good stunts and good music ,  it has the ingredients you expect including water , rockfalls , runaway carts .  .  .  apart from the first episode ( with ralph faulkner ) the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as i remembered it ,  and yes it features the inevitable  " flashback "  episode !  it gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace ,  padding and the other tricks .  if you are interested in these serials i recommend the book by william witney ,   " in a door ,  into a fight ,  out a door ,  into a chase "  although there is only a small entry about this series in it . 
after viewing  " whipped "  at a distributor's screening at the afm the other night ,  i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed .  the audience was laughing all the way through .  unfortunately ,  every territory was already sold ,  so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film ,  but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas .  i agree with the comment that  " whipped "  should not be pitched as a male  " sex and the city ,  "  mainly because unlike  " sex and the city ,  "   " whipped "  is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously .   " whipped "  pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldn't dare .  also ,  the film that i screened at the afm had more of a plot and story than  " swingers ,  "   " clerks ,  "  and  " sex and the city "  combined .   " whipped "  never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non-stop comedy .  the performances of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid ,  which only made the film more impressive considering the budget . 
i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies/language arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the microphone on the water barrel part =d i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas/coffee/phone/play station commercial its nice seeing him on tv he was also on everybody hates chris except he always get the small part la la why do we have to right 10 lines thats so stupid -_- i think i'm done never mind i'm still not done what is this a joke ?  why do we have to go all the way to line ten .  .  .  really what's the point of it ?  ?  !  !  i will just right random words for now -_- maple story is fun i love my friends
amy poehler and rachel dratch are among the funnier women to have been on  " saturday night live "  .  it's unfortunate that they ,  along with tina fey and maya rudolph ,  were on snl during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch-making  ( circa 2002-2006 )  the show has ever had .  still ,  these two women most especially know what's funny ,  and they know how to write a funny movie .   you'll notice in the credits of this movie that dratch and director ryan shiraki wrote the story for  " spring breakdown "  ,  but who wrote the actual screenplay ,  consisting of dialogue and all the important fill-in-the-blank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie ?  yep ,  just shiraki .  just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie ,  and no women apparently wrote the script with him .  the result is a pretty cliché spring break movie that doesn't so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as mtv does every year .   if dratch ,  poehler ,  and even co-star parker posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay ,  it would have been far less cliché .  the premise is original ,  being about three thirty-something women who were unpopular in high school  ( and apparently college ,  too )  who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about .  i say  " allegedly "  because you never quite know what fun is to these characters .  they entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro-woman anthems like  " true colors "  ,  and spend their nights together holding make-your-own-pizza parties .  even though none of them are especially unattractive ,  the outside world appears to treat them like they are .  there's a scene where a blind student of poehler's  ( played by poehler's real life husband will arnett )  asks her out on a date ,  only to touch her face and immediately change his mind .  if poehler's character is supposed to be unattractive ,  they obviously hired the wrong actress .   the movie continues to show promise ,  even though we have our doubts about the main characters ,  when posey's boss ,  texas senator 'kay bee' hartmann  ( jane lynch ,  funny as always )  hires posey to watch over her unpopular college-age daughter  ( amber tamblyn ,  playing yet another woman who's attractive in real life ,  but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie )  while she goes to a laguna beach-like vacation spot for spring break .  poehler and dratch come along ,  they reluctantly get boozed up ,  party like they apparently should have when they were in college ,  and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by sophie monk .   sophie monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons .  unfortunately ,  her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny  " date movie "   ( 2006 )  and the disappointing  " click "   ( 2006 )  .  here ,  she plays a southern belle ,  although her voice sounds like she stole delta burke's voice box .  she hams it up a little too much ,  trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras .    " spring breakdown "  was released straight to dvd despite the star power of amy poehler ,  but rightly so because the story is way too cliché .  it may as well have been called  " national lampoon's spring breakdown "  ,  and the magazine probably wouldn't have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity .  if director shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input ,  especially rachel dratch ,  this movie would have been great and not nearly as run-of-the-mill as frat-house comedies we've seen before .  i know dratch will come up with another funny concept ,  and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself .  she's funny enough ,  and she deserves better than this half-baked comedy that would accept stiffler's brother with open arms . 
saw this 'film' recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see .  what the hell was going on with coolio ?  totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress .  totally uninvolving ,  slow ,  tedious and detached .  worse than spawn .  long live  " evil dead ii "  . 
thank you hollywood .  yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap ,  shallow ,  effect-heavy and redundant remake .  the original  " planet of the apes "  was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message .  it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue ,  which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting .    this movie ,  on the other hand ,  seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues .  instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie .  dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum ,  character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on .  instead ,  we get a bunch of pointless action scenes ,  some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations .    the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic .  the make-up of the apes is magnificent ,  and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too .  however ,  this does not distract from the fact that  " planet of the apes  ( 2001 )  "  is a very shallow and simplistic movie ,  filled with paper-thin characters ,  stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot .  please hollywood ,  stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters .   oh yeah ,  the ending did not make any sense whatsoever .   * out of **** stars ,  mainly for the visuals  
wow !  i didn't know that someone would make this movie !  its awful !  i have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie .   number 1 :   " its the biggest rave ever "  where is the that rave ?  i could only see a few people dancing around .  .    2 .  when they are on the rave , they can only see blood everywhere , no people , two ruined tents and one stage .  .  and what do they do !  ?  they drink !   3 . the worst actors i have ever seen !  the captain and his crew .  .  awful !    4 .  when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun ,  he shoots almost 30 times without reloading !    5 .  i didn't knew every person in the world could fight as a pro !  must be a new thing .  .   i wonder what the producer was thinking !   " this is going to be a big hit ,  its gonna be a classic "   .  .  sure u dumb s**t anyway don't see this movie ,  its a waist of time .  my eyes are still bleeding ! 
a painfully protracted ,  maudlin and predictable drama ,  my twenty-fifth sidney lumet film ,  garbo talks ,  gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest .   the film documents a harried young working man named gilbert  ( ron silver )  ,  who is son to estelle rolle  ( anne bancroft )  ,  eccentric ,  feisty and above all ,  an obsessive fan of greta garbo .  when estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor ,  her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own :  track down greta garbo ,  and bring her to his mother .   anne bancroft is in full-on ,  chew-the-scenery auntie-mame mode here ,  that kind of feisty ol' gal that film loves ,  where she mouths off to people ,  and stands up for her ideals ,  and ends up in jail all the time .  she stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct ,  and every scene with her is yuk-yuk lame ;  every note striking false .  the rest of the characters are equally as one-dimensional ,  but tremendously less-interesting .  ron silver is flat as can be ,  and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film :  he is dating affluent lisa rolfe  ( carrie fisher )  ,  but becomes smitten with oddball co-worker jane mortimer  ( catherine hicks )  ,  and i called every scene three scenes before they happen .   that's the other problem .  one-dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story ,  but there's simply nothing here .  the film's pace is glacial ,  resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing ,  and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot ,  it's both plodding and uninteresting .  there are plenty of guest stars ,  so to speak ,  including harvey fierstein as a gay new yorker  ( imagine that )  in yet another highly inessential scene .   late in the film ,  it attempts to make a halfway-decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives ,  but by that time ,  none of the characters exist as real people ,  and the film had bored me into submission ,  so it functions as a case of far-too-little ,  far-too-late .  the film is my twenty-fifth lumet-directed film ,  making him easily my most-viewed director ,  but outside of a couple egregious misses  ( a stranger among us ,  anyone ?  )  ,  he hasn't plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of garbo talks .   {grade :  4 . 5/10  ( c/c- )  / #21  ( of 24 )  of 1984 / #23 of 25 lumet films}
of life in  ( some )  colleges .  of course there were artistic licenses taken ,  but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges .   i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own .  it's funny because these are schools that want racial unity ,  equality etc .  and i can honestly say ,  that it's there .  but the thing is when class lets out ,  or when they're just hanging out waiting for class ,  they  ( students )  seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity .  is that bad ?  not really .  everyone needs a feeling of belonging .  but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that ,   " we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them .  "  otherwise you're creating your own segregation .   racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended .  one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations .  fortunately ,  nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering .   i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen .   so is  " higher learning "  overly dramatic ?  exaggerated ?  maybe .  is it way  " off mark ?  "  it depends on where you went to or go to school .  the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen .  minus the hollywood exaggerations ,  the race thing hit pretty close to home for me . 
living in the middle east  ( in israel )  ,  i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana .  having seen the trailer ,  and being a thriller-lover ,  i expected to see first of all a fast moving ,  breath catching movie ,  which wisely dips in global policy-making and the relation between oil ,  power and corruption ,  from a fresh angle .  well ,  i almost left the movie in the middle .  the pace was painfully slow ,  almost all characters were stereotyped ,  the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult ,  but ,  as steve rhodes wrote in his review ,  in the end you don't care .  save your money ,  save your time ,  choose another movie .   robi chernitsky
i thought i read somewhere that this was the last monogram production ,  but whether that's true or not it doesn't matter ,  because if it wasn't ,  then it should have been .  it's a deadly dull affair starring john carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is experimenting with the aid of his young apprentice  ( robert shayne )  in bringing the dead back to life .  every time their subjects are revived ,  they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they are lying strapped to the laboratory table  ( big deal )  .  carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after it's dead ,  and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostlike fashion  ( wooooooooohhhh )  .  that's about all she wrote .   for an ultra-cheap monogram quickie ,  this thing at least actually utilizes a more fancy-schmancy lab setup than is usually allotted .  the funniest running joke in the movie is that the  " older "  doctor carradine constantly refers to his  " young "  assistant shayne as  " m'boy "  when ,  in fact ,  carradine was actually 40 and shayne was 45 when they made this ! 
the howling ii starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by christopher lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field ,  oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason .  he says  " for it's written the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood .  and i saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication's and upon her forehead was written ,  behold i am the great mother of #an inaudible word i couldn't make out no matter how many times i rewound the tape and tried to ,  sorry# and all abominations of the earth "  .  this opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre .  after the opening credits which are set over shots of transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we're in 'los angeles ,  california u . s . a .  city of the angels' .  i knew i was in for a long 86 minutes .  it's probably not too long after the events of the original howling  ( 1981 )  and it's karen white's funeral .  after the ceremony karen's brother ben  ( reb brown )  is spoken to by an 'occult investigator' called stefan crosscoe  ( christopher lee )  who says that karen is a werewolf and that she will come back to life .  ben dismisses such nonsense .  but together with one of karen's friends and colleagues jenny  ( annie mcenroe )  he visits stefan at his home .  there stefan tells them about werewolves and how they can be killed ,  he mentions stirba  ( sybil danning )  who is the queen of werewolves .  stefan also shows them a photograph taken at karen's funeral of a woman named mariana  ( marsha a .  hunt )  and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous werewolf who wants karen .  stefan says he will stake any werewoves through the heart with titanium .  ben figures out that stefan means he will stake karen as well so together with jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister's crypt is to stop stefan .  however lots of werewolves turn up and attack stefan ,  ben and jenny .  they survive the attack and manage to find out that stirba is to be found in transylvania .  they all decide to travel to transylvania and stop stirba and her werewolves from taking over the earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse .  once there they travel to a small town called vlkava which means 'where wolves live' and meet up with the local priest ,  father florin  ( ladislav krecmer )  and his small but loyal group of werewolf hunters ,  hey what else can i call them ?  oh ,  and a dwarf named florica  ( ludmila safarova )  helps too .  they follow mariana who they hope will lead them to stirba .  but stirba knows of stefan's arrival and has plans for him ben and jenny .  will stefan be able to put an end to stirba's plans for world domination ?  will this film get any more bizarre or surreal ?  watch it and find out .  directed by philippe mora this is one strange mess of a film .  it's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently .  the single biggest problem is the script by robert sano and gary brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like .  luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring ,  unlike the original .  something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained .  most people will probably hate it ,  but for those of us who enjoy 'bad' films this is right up there with the best of them .  there are werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch .  we get some cool werewolf killing weaponry .  the sets and locations just seem so out of place and i don't know if this was actually shot in transylvania but it doesn't look like what i thought mid 80's transylvania would .  stirba's castle is part dungeon ,  part gothic castle and part modern luxury house .  stirba and her servant's costumes are very over-the-top ,  stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a s/m video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy ,  and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too .  the special make-up effects range from good to poor ,  a dwarf's eyes explode ,  someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn't a film loaded with gore ,  although there are plenty of effect sequences with werewolf transformations and attacks .  there is plenty of nudity as well as stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of werewolves !  i should also mention the music ,  the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that i hated and i ended up turning the volume down .  acting is weak all round and what on earth was christopher lee thinking about when he accepted this film ?  !  i wonder what he thinks of it .  basically the whole thing is a real mess ,  but i found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same .  impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end .  speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage ,  it also features the same shot of sybil danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times !  if that's your thing . 
i question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the btk killer's motives .  are they attempting to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters ?  who is responsible for this ?  don't they think the people involved with this monster are hurting enough ?  what a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims !  it was like a personality experiment :  what disturbs you more ,  the slaughterhouse or the human murders ?  they used actual names of some of the victims .  .  .  . this movie was hideous ,  disrespectful and insulting !  the creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda !  people need to awaken and redraw the line ! 
it was a doubly interesting experience .  for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century had never been the central figure in a movie* .  the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are champaign for caesar ,  where  ( like a  " deus ex ma-china "  )  the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show ,  so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all ,  and in bullshot where the great albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain ,  intent on stealing some machines of theirs .  it is notable that in those two cases ,  and in iq ,  we are dealing with comedies .  so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein ,  like john huston's attempt to do one on freud with montgomery cliff .  i guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro-magnetic field theory into exciting dialog .  but then ,  only three years ago russell crowe and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind .  maybe nobody really has tried .    ( *subsequently ,  after writing this ,  i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with yahoo serious about ten years ago .  but that is an exception and it was a spoof .  )   the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert .  it was walter matthau ,  here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers .  matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor ,  in both comedy and drama ,  but normally his comic personas were variants of his  " whiplash willie "  gingrich from the fortune cookie .  they were connivers and gonifs .  later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them ,  but they remained grumpy types .  but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet .  more like his kotch than like willie clarke .   he plays albert as good old uncle albert .  it seems that matthau's einstein is living in princeton with his niece catherine boyd  ( meg ryan )  ,  and she is seeing a stuffy professor named james morland  ( stephen fry )  .  but fry's car needs repairs ,  and they take it to the auto shop where ed walters  ( tim robbins )  works .  robbins falls for ryan ,  who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires .  good old uncle albert ,  aided by his three friends  ( lou jacobi ,  joseph maher ,  and gene saks )  decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius .  this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan ,  provided ryan is impressed and fry does not spoil things  ( as he hopes to do )  .   the atmosphere is sweet ,  as when matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help robbins cheat on  ( by switching the positions of their bodies )  .  the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president eisenhower  ( keene curtis )  .   it was a charming comedy ,  and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal ,  but far more subdued . 
this movie features a gorgeous brunette named danielle petty .  she has stunning green eyes ,  and is in the first few scenes and the last scene .  she is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive .  she may not have a future as an actress ,  because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers .   the movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it .  it is not a good horror film ,  or a good fake journalistic report ,  or remotely well done .  there is no skill apparent in it's production .  it is like a bad student film .  the story's horrific elements do not make you sick ,  it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick .  i would give this movie zero stars if i could . 
ok ,  so it was written in 1996 ,  before 9/11 ,  so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world ,  is prescient .  that's it .  that's the good stuff .  the acting .  .  . fair .  the plot .  .  . silly .  the  " twist "  .  .  .  unnecessary .  dooooooooooom it isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated .  don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for  " plagues "  and how to contain them ?  proper execution of such a plan is always a problem ,  as we saw after katrina .  but they have a plan .  it isn't to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania .  and if the virus is carried in the air ,  why was the plane door open and the  " shooters' standing there with no protection ?  in fact ,  did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs ?  that would stop her .  but not as dramatic .  i'm a sucker .  i always watch a movie to see the end ,  once i started it .  but this was a waste of time ,  and for the most part ,  predictable .  i saw it using a recorder so i didn't have to watch all the ads ,  that was a plus .  it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv .  rubbish . 
is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws ?  orca isn't exactly a  " jaws rip off "  but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jaws's success .  first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie ,  not terrible but definitely not good ,  average at best .   the plot is basically a male killer whale  ( orca )  after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge .  i couldn't stand to watch this movie again .  the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director ,  producers ,  and writers were almost talentless .   as for the acting ,  it was very average and believable ,  however the actual characters aren't the least bit likable .  the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good .   the violence is confusing ,  bloody ,  and not recommended for more sensitive people .  the music is overdone and very loud ,  drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times .  i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale  ( killer whales don't mate with only one mate as depicted in orca )  .   overall this movie was bad/poor in my opinion ,  because of the reasons listed above .  some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so i'm not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it .   my rating :  3 . 5/10  ( but for its concept possibly a 5/10 ) 
this was the third muppet movie and the last one jim henson was around to take part in the making of before his premature death in 1990 .  the first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before i was born .  i originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy ,   " the muppet movie "  and  " the great muppet caper "  ,  around the mid-nineties ,  as a kid ,  but didn't see this third one ,   " the muppets take manhattan "  ,  until april 2007 .  this was shortly after i had seen its two predecessors and 1996's  " muppet treasure island "  for the first time in many years .  this third muppet movie definitely didn't disappoint me the first time i saw it ,  and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much ,  but if not ,  it certainly didn't go too far downhill .   the muppets' stage musical ,   " manhattan melodies "  ,  turns out to be a big hit on their college campus .  they are graduating from college ,  so they will soon be leaving ,  but decide they will all stay together and go to manhattan to try and get their show on broadway .  after their arrival ,  they begin searching for a producer ,  but after many rejections ,  they finally decide to part and go find jobs .  most of them leave town ,  but kermit stays ,  and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the muppet gang .  he gets a job at a new york restaurant owned by a man named pete .  the frog quickly befriends pete's daughter ,  jenny ,  an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father's restaurant as a waitress .  as kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom ,  now with the help of jenny ,  he doesn't know that miss piggy has secretly stayed in new york and is now spying on him .  she begins to see kermit and jenny together ,  and to her it looks like they're getting close ,  which leads to jealousy !    when i saw this movie for the second time ,  it looked disappointing at first .  it seemed a little rushed ,  unfocused ,  and maybe even forgettable around the beginning .  there are some funny bits during this part of the film ,  such as animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus ,  but for a little while ,  the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors .  fortunately ,  it wasn't long before that changed .  the film is entertaining for the most part ,  with  " saying goodbye "  ,  the poignant song the muppets sing as they part ,  and a lot that happens after that .  the two funniest parts might be miss piggy's tantrums after she sees kermit and jenny hugging ,  but there were definitely many other times when i laughed ,  such as poor fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears .  the muppets still have their charm and comical antics ,  which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part ,  as does the plot ,  a simple but intriguing one for all ages .  there are some weaker moments ,  such as the muppet babies sequence ,  and juliana donald's performance as jenny is lacklustre ,  but neither of these problems are too significant ,  and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience .   i would say  " the muppet movie "  ,  the film that started the franchise in 1979 ,  is the best of the original trilogy ,  and that seems to be the most popular opinion .  this third film is probably the weakest of the three ,  but all of them are good .  unlike  " muppets from space "  ,  the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after henson's sad passing ,  at least  " the muppets take manhattan "  is still the muppets !  i won't go into details about what i think of the muppets' 1999 film ,  released twenty years after their first one ,  since i've already explained in my review of it why i found it so disappointing ,  and even though it does have some appeal ,  i'm clearly not alone .  however ,  every theatrical movie starring the lovable muppets that was made during henson's life is good entertainment for the whole family ,  even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it . 
obviously ,  i didn't care for things to come  ( aka  " the shape of things to come "  )  as much as most viewers .  that means that there is a good chance that you'll enjoy it more than i did .  at any rate ,  you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view .   directed by william cameron menzies ,  who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director ,  this is a film adaptation by h . g .  wells of his own novel by the same name .  in my eyes ,  it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter .   the film opens in 1940 in a london-like  " everytown "  .  war is brewing and the citizens of everytown are worried that it might reach them .  it does .  and it turns into a decades-long affair that basically destroys civilization .  wells and menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath .  we see two pilots ,  one downed ,  coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting .  we meet a post-apocalyptic community ruled over by a would-be warlord .  we meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society .  we see the way that technology is changing .  and finally ,  we're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 ,  where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon .   that might all sound potentially very exciting ,  but it just does not work as a film .  structurally ,  the film is far too episodic ,  with little to dramatically tie it together .  by the third segment ,  i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters .  i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments .  there's a constant parade of new faces .  we don't get to learn anything about any of them .   it doesn't help that the individual segments ,  with a couple exceptions ,  tend to be awkwardly directed and edited .  they are also occasionally manipulative--it can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film .  but maybe contradictorily ,  the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally .   in fact ,  one overlong section is more like a music video/industrial promotional video .  if features shots of building the futuristic city ,  with lots of large machinery ,  lots of welding ,  and so on .  at one point ,  a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass .  the music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score .  i can't say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of drama .   but the common cry in support of things to come is that it is  " a film about ideas "  .  that may be true ,  but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way .  one ,  it still doesn't make it work _as a film_ ,  that is ,  as a visual and aural dramatic artwork ,  and two ,  there are far too many ideas presented here .   the principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations .  that's a fine thing to make a film about .  it's also remarkably prescient of world war ii ,  as the things to come was scripted and filmed in 1935  ( released in 1936 )  .  wells has some interesting things to say about war ,  some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film .  for example ,  the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out ,  or will at any moment .  the overall message seems a trifle pessimistic .  wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised ,  although it doesn't preclude  " progress " --in fact ,  maybe it fuels progress ,  at least indirectly .   that would certainly be enough for one film .  however ,  there are many more ideas here .  the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film .  it deals with a complex dilemma .  one pilot has shot the other down ,  but is now coming to assist him .  but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field .  they can't both breathe the gas without harm .  a girl comes along .  they only have two functioning gas-masks between them .  the pilot who was shot down offers his mask ,  as he says he's dying anyway .  what to do ?  it's not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length ,  but the ideas--the bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war--are enough to build a film on .   another example .  during the scenes featuring the would-be warlord ,  in the post-apocalyptic environment ,  there is a nasty contagious disease called the  " wandering sickness "  going around .  it turns victims into something like drunken zombies .  the usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease .  this material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought .  it's a great idea and deserved its own film .   similarly ,  wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas .  that was enough for its own film ,  too .  it's just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes ,  especially when it's supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction .   still ,  there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing .  if you're at all a sci-fi buff ,  this is a historically important film .  given menzies' background ,  the production and set designs are interesting ,  even if the cinematography seems extremely dated .  it's also interesting to see how wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his  " predictions "  .  i particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon ,  which was strongly reminiscent of george méliès' 1902 a trip to the moon  ( aka le voyage dans la lune )  .  just don't expect too much from things to come . 
i respect the fact that this is a very popular show .  however ,  in comparison with robert altman's ingenious ,  hilarious ,  zany ,  and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic ,  this show was probably destined to be less-than-mediocre .  .  .  even if it did run for 11 years ,  that doesn't necessarily make it any good .  this show formed an all-too-integral part of my early childhood  ( it was on re-runs every night ,  and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up )  ,  but it's one of the memories i don't miss .  and now that i actually have seen the movie ,  i can give this series an accurate critique .  on its own ,  it's not nearly  " 2 out of 10 "  bad .  however ,  the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie .  some of them technically are the same ,  but they're only similar in name .  for instance ,  since when is alan alda anything like donald sutherland ?  his style of humor is totally different ,  as are his characterization and outlook .  the new characters are not that great ;  they just serve to make you miss the ones that they're replacing .  it's the same with the new actors  ( including jamie farr )  .  the only thing that actually transfers to the series is radar ,  who's still  ( even though played by the same actor )  merely a pale imitation of the original .  what else ?  oh ,  yeah .  with a laugh track  ( it didn't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not )  ,  it comes across as creepy ,  due to what's going on in the other settings .  and because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual korean war ,  it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that doesn't work outside the world of cartoons .  i've never liked this show ,  and i never will . 
terry gilliam's and david peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's .  people's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  i especially love the idea one can't change the past ;  it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness .  gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness ,  perfection and originality .   the story itself is engaging :  one man ,  james cole  ( played by bruce willis in a heart-warming performance )  travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground :  with the information he'll collect ,  scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface .  but because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect ,  he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things .  and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists ,  end of the millennium paranoia ,  biological weapons ,  the perception of reality ,  and the definition of sanity .  with such a complex movie ,  it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess ,  but instead twelve monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas .   i watched this movie once around 10 years ago .  it marked me a lot :  i remember still thinking about many days after-wards ;  for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important .  i've re-watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and it's better than i remembered it .  brad pitt still steals all the scenes he's in ,  playing jeffrey goines  almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club  a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and ,  according to cole ,  perhaps responsible for the virus .  the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie ,  pitt's eyes ,  voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands .  pitt's oscar nomination was well deserved !  surprising was also bruce willis' performance :  his i didn't remember very well ,  but it's beautiful and full of sensibility ;  he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground ,  and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up .  cole is a rather ambiguous character ,  peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him ,  and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself :  the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked .  ironically cole didn't start as a crazy character ,  but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world ,  he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind ,  until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future ,  reality from fiction .  willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure ,  and it works perfectly .  one of the fun twists in the narrative is when cole's shrink ,  dr .  kathryn railly ,  finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world .  the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace .  their relationship is also well-handed ,  although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake .  but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past .  but then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport ,  wrapping all the pieces together ,  which will blow many minds away .   there are two great endings in this movie ,  a twist in the sense of se7en or fight club ,  and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who's witnessing his future self die ;  the two share a brief look ,  and she smiles at him .  the twist is brilliant ,  but i prefer this ending for emotional impact .  madeleine stowe is very good playing dr .  railly ,  she drew many different emotions from me in her performance .  the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed :  this movie shows that in a terrifying way .  it reminds me of chinatown in that sense ,  the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help .  railly's character shares that fatalism ,  the more she tries to help cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy .   the twist ends with a hopeful note ,  though ,  with the feeling cole's mission hasn't been in vain .  twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained ;  it's not supposed to be art ,  although it's more artists than many artistic movies .  it's an unpretentious movie where all elements ,  from music to editing to costume design ,  etc .  ,  came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece . 
about the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end .  .  .  i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would gel .  .  .  alas .  .  .   those who like gus van sant's films - especially his later ones - will probably like this .  personally ,  i find van sant's films to be dull ,  pretentious and facile .  well ,  he was an executive producer for this film ,  so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him - although personally i actually liked this better than van sant's latest efforts  ( e . g .  elephant )  .   contrary to many here ,  i did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed ,  i thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood - the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world - but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all .  but i feel that the problem with the film is that  " mood "  is not enough .  .  .  and not only that ,  but that the mood painted here is ,  to my mind ,  incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening .  the dream-like quality ,  so closely linked to nature ,  is beautifully captured here ,  but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child ,  one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold  ( waves on a beach ,  grasses and flowers ,  spiders etc )  .  the rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when i was about eight or nine .  there is a languor to the film that is in opposition to what should be a very tense time in an adolescent life .  when you are caught up in a crush on someone - or being the object of bullying at school - you are anything but languorous !  there are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film .  .  . spoilers here - first when logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit .  the frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid - especially with no father present - seemed real to me .   the second ,  and only part of the film with any tension to it ,  were the scenes where  " leah "   ( logan's re-creation of himself )  phones rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone-sex .  the first reason i liked it is because the person who did the voice-over of  " leah "  was the most convincing actor in the entire film .   ( it made me think of claire danes from my so-called life  .  .  . the voice even sounded like claire .  )  she and rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids .  and what i especially liked was the fact that rodeo only pretended to play along .  .  .  it was perhaps the best moment in the film as - finally !  - we got some character development .   all in all ,  a somewhat misplaced effort .  .  .  we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director's possible talents .  in the meantime ,  if he can get away from van sant's influence ,  it might do him a world of good .  who is this director anyhow - one of van sant's boy toys ? 
maybe it's just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff ,  but this one got under my skin  ( pardon the pun )  .  this piece is brave ,  not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies .  not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the  " screwee "  ,  i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself .  some parts are very reminiscant of  " hellraiser "  ,  but come off as tribute rather than imitation .  it's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider ,  but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile .  this piece brings it and doesn't appologize .  i liked this one a lot .  do not watch whilst eating pudding . 
this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale .  a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy .  they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence .  however ,  after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence .  however ,  out of no where ,  when they are on a luxury cruise ,  the ship sinks and they lose everything--and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life !  what an odd ,  silly and preachy film !  personally ,  i'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable !   the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions--a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting . 
i was raised watching the original batman animated series ,  and am an avid batman graphic novel collector .  with a comic book hero as iconic as batman ,  there are certain traits that cannot be changed .  creative liberties are all well and good ,  but when it completely changes the character ,  then it is too far .  i purchased one of the seasons of  " the batman "  in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators' reasoning for making this show such an atrocity .  in an interview on the making of  " the batman ,  "  one of the artists or writers  ( i'm unsure which )  said that  " we felt we shouldn't mess with batman ,  but we could mess with the villains .  "  so ,  they proceeded to make the joker into an immature little kid begging for attention ,  the penguin into some anime knockoff ,  mr .  freeze into a super-powered jewel thief ,  poison ivy into a teenage hippie ,  and countless other shameful acts which are making bob kane roll over in his grave .    to sum it all up :  i wish i had more hands so i could give this show four thumbs down .  it squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the batman name .  warner bros .  .  . rethink this !  please ! 
this movie was my first touch with mr sica so i really didn't know what to expect .  but what i saw just broke all my expectations - in a good way .   the storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy- orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses .  this little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine .  but one day there is a water resource found and a rich nobles man is getting interested in the buying the place .  but as the title of the movie hints - there is a miracle taking place .  our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother .  what is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well ?   it was just a masterpiece of natural comedy .  there is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people .  also many funny moments and scenes are included - at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more .   so according to the fact that i m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because i liked it much   i
i used to watch this on either hbo or showtime or cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels .  i came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark ,  bizarre and fascinating .  i was young then ,  in my early teens ;  and now years later after having discovered the great arliss howard and being blown away by  " big bad love "  i bought the dvd of  " wilder napalm "  and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years .  i absolutely loved it !  i was really impressed and affected by it .  there are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography ;  all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent ,  intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads ,  their story ,  the music and all the other actors as well .  it's truly  " cinematic "  .  i love arliss howard's subtle intensity ,  ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence ,  i'm a big fan of anything he does ;  and his interplay with debra winger's manic glee  ( they are of course married )  has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera .   ( i wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries ?  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  " big bad love "  should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it ;  it's brilliant .  )  and ,  dennis quaid in full clown make-up ,  sneakily introduced ,  angled ,  hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often .  quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways ,  with that huge slit mouth span ,  hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness  ( here as both )  .  both howard and quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion .  in fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity .  it's really a fantastic film ,  put together by intelligence ,  imagination ,  agility and chemistry by all parties involved .  i really cannot imagine how this got funded ,  and it looks pretty expensive to me ,  by such a conventional ,  imagination-less system ,  but i thank god films like this slip through the system every once in awhile .  in a great way ,  with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors ,  hip intelligence ,  darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time :   " grosse pointe blank "  .  .  .  .  .  .  . now that's a compliment in my book ! 
***comments contain spoilers*** i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene ,  when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case ,  when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant  ( but we weren't to notice )  and when colby was a f*****g triple agent .  but now ,  in tonight's episode , david is trapped with a paranoid ,  nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun ,  in an elevator and .  .  .  . he can't disarm him .  a trained ,  experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand-to-hand fighting ,  can't take out a nut job .  not when said nut job blinks ,  looks away ,  drops his head ,  closes his eyes ;  not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds .   then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby ,  frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick/love interest amita ,  my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged .  don gives david the  " distress word "  that is the code for  " the s**t is about to go down "  ;  david is ready ,  they kill the lights ,  drop the elevator ,  startle the nut job and .  .  .  .  .  .   david cannot disarm/kill/beat into submission the nut job .  the bad guy ends up with both guns ,  david ends up shot .   i'm done .  hope the numb3rs are fun . 
'presque rien'  ( 'come undone' )  is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director sébastien lifshitz  ( with the collaboration of writer stéphane bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'wild side' )  .  as we come to understand lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable .  by allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now ,  time passed ,  time reflective ,  time imagined ,  time alone - lifshitz makes his tales more personal ,  involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses .  it takes a bit of work to key into his method ,  but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film .   mathieu  ( handsome and gifted jérémie elkaïm )  is visiting the seaside for a holiday ,  a time to allow his mother  ( dominique reymond )  to struggle with her undefined illness ,  cared for by the worldly and wise annick  ( marie matheron )  and accompanied by his sister sarah  ( laetitia legrix )  :  their distant father has remained at home for business reasons .  weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of mathieu alone ,  looking depressed ,  riding trains ,  speaking to someone in a little recorder .  we are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action .   while sunning at the beach mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him ,  and we can feel mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion .  the youth cédric  ( stéphane rideau )  follows mathieu and his sister home ,  continuing the mystery of attraction .  soon cédric approaches mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession .  mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking ,  rebuffs cédric's public approaches ,  but continues to seek him out for consignations .  the two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship ,  so very necessary to understanding this story ,  is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes .  yet as the summer wears on mathieu ,  a committed student ,  realizes that cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival .  it becomes apparent that cédric is the dionysian partner while mathieu is the apollonian one :  in a telling time in architectural ruin mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking .   mathieu is a complex person ,  coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father ,  a fear of his burgeoning sexuality ,  and his nascent passion for cédric .  their moments of joy are disrupted by cédric's admission of infidelity and mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways .  time passes ,  family changes are made ,  and mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt .  the manner in which mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace ,  strangely enough ,  in one of cédric's past lovers pierre  ( nils ohlund )  brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax .   after viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful .  lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion ,  conflicts with passion's powers found in love ,  and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful .  the entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative .  lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making .  in french with english subtitles .  highly recommended .  grady harp
not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot .  during the whole film ,  i was like .  .  . erm .  .  . what is this movie all about ?  i don't get the animations at all .  probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s .  during the film ,  there is a group of people walked out .  after the movie ,  many people said ,   " that's it ?  "  frankly speaking ,  i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award .  if you are thinking of watching this film ,  i strongly recommend you not to .  you will regret it .  i'm not joking .  you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it . 
so mary and rhoda have aged--who hasn't ?  i was a teen when mary premiered ,  and a  " young adult "  when it left the air .  yes ,  it was great to see mary and rho together ,  and yes ,  maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series ,  but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute .  example :  the producer who hires mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about  " old people .  "  isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day hollywood tv and film  " bean counters ?  "  this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best--but it's a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s . 
ladislas starewicz's curiosity with insects and cinema melds into a short film about a love triangle between mr .  beetle ,  an artistic grasshopper ,  and mrs .  beetle .  the rather simple story of an adulterous beetle couple that both seek stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a biograph or vitagraph short of the time .  starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame-by-frame animation .  the story builds as mr .  beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper .  when mr .  beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend ,  he chases her around angrily ,  but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see a movie .  however ,  mrs .  beetle soon learns of her husband's infidelities as the movie they watch is the jealous grasshopper's footage of mr .  beetle and the dragonfly together .  mrs .  beetle thrashes mr .  beetle with her umbrella ,  mr .  beetle jumps through the screen ,  and they both end up in jail after the projector they wreck catches on fire .  the insects are placed in humanized settings such as a house or a nightclub ,  and are given human characteristics of jealousy ,  anger ,  lust ,  and revenge .  the insect characters carry briefcases ,  drive motorcars ,  and even wear shoes yet they also twitch their antennae and open and close their mandibles as real insects would .  the novelty of the story doesn't wear itself out ,  even after multiple viewings ,  but as fluid as the movements are ,  the film moves slowly .  action happens with intricate detail ,  but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process .  despite its pace ,  the film is an excellent example of starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended . 
this one is a great one !  robert de niro and cuba gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film .  this is the true story of the first black us navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist master diver .  along the way ,  he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates ,  none of whom want him in their class .  they move out of the barracks when he arrives .  ultimately ,  he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a us navy diver .  watch this one !  it's a great tale of courage and honor .  as the story unfolds ,  we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time . 
towards the end of the movie ,  i felt it was too technical .  i felt like i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea .  i liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers .  i guess i should have figured that out before ,  but i never thought about it .  using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic .  the acting was pretty good ,  since they're mostly seasoned professionals ,  but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen ,  it should be more like a fantasy ,  comical ,  etc .  everything was taken too seriously .  at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot ,  with buck rogers ,  the night stalker ,  and dracula also on board .  the movie was filled with well known faces .  i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama ,  but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature .  that's why i said it should have been more comical .  my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about .  they walk around with drinks ,  setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later ,  just as if they're in a building or something ,  and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist .  also ,  i know it's a disaster movie ,  but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something .  anyway ,  the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening .  i like lee grant ,  but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked .  .  .  :  ) 
i've watched this documentary twice - and although i'm an major movie buff ,  most documentaries don't hold my attention .  this film however was mesmerizing .  almost every shot is perfect - saying so much more than an audio commentary  ( which this documentary does not have )  .   the concept of this film is amazing ,  i can't praise it enough .  mardi gras beads - who would have thought ?  ?    amazing and excellent choices of interviews - film footage of a factory in china - the film makes you feel like you are actually there .   i'm political aware - and i've read several books on globalization so there wasn't anything in this film that was a surprise to me .  however ,  it's made me think so much .    i wish so much too ,  that this world was a better place .   a million kudos to the filmmaker - and thanks for making this film too .   i wish everyone could see it . 
didn't mystic pizza win the oscar for that year ?  this movie never had a chance ,  due to the casting ,  but perhaps by now people can see why i felt that way upon leaving the theater .  only  " wargames "  left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater ,  with the feeling i was getting a glimpse of our future .  history has shown that this is exactly what happened .   the casting is a pop-culture cuisinart of the 1980s :  you get arnold as ben richards ,  the framed fugitive offered a chance to  " run "  for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie ;  richard dawson as damon killian ,  treating his role as if he were the host of family feud with the contestants using real guns ;  jesse ventura as  " captain freedom "  and co-wrestler professor tanaka as  " subzero ,  "  both  " stalkers "  who kill the  " running men .  "  even mick fleetwood  ( mic )  and dweezil zappa  ( stevie )  show up ,  while the  " dancers of the future "  are none other than the laker girls .  this movie screams  " 80s .  "  the plot is a good excuse for the action :  ben richards is determined to prove his innocence ,  but agrees to be the running man when he is told that his buddies would be set free ;  instead ,  they join him as  " contestants .  "  maria conchita alonzo as amber mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge salma hayek in the 1990s .   the production value on the film was a bit poor ,  the lines were cheesy ,  and  ( at the time )  ,  the plot seemed a bit far-fetched .  i remember thinking when i was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film ,  but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast ?  if the running man were listed in tv guide ,  most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today .  the government influences on the media have only gotten worse ,  and the dumbed-down american public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for  " national security "  is downright chilling .  ben richards is played brilliantly by arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of america is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience .   the movie was way over the top ,  maybe even off the cliff for its time ,  but as with back to the future iii ,  the  " ravine "  it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond ,  and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time .  it is tragic that ,  as with wargames ,  the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved .   " serious "  actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more oscars ,  but that doesn't make them better films than their  " common man "  counterparts ,  such as this one .   an absolute must-see . 
french director jean rollin isn't exactly known for great films ,  and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why .  one of the most confusing things about this production is the title .  for a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires ;  you would expect a film with the word 'nude' in the title to be a particularly bare-breasted one ;  but in fact ,  there's not a lot of nudity here at all .  instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on ;  we've got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality ,  a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult ,  who don't get to do much .  the film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young french man ,  who also happens to be the son of a man of importance .  through his investigation ,  he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady ,  and as he delves deeper into the cult ;  he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets ,  drinks blood and can't go out in daylight .  .  . sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me .   jean rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film ,  but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed .  it is possible to keep up with what's going on ,  but only because there's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one .  the director seems to know that he's messed up the plotting too ,  as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience .  there is a twist thrown in at the end also ;  but the film would have been better without it .  i guess this was jean rollin's attempt to be a little original ,  but it comes off as a ham-fisted attempt at such ,  rather than a logical continuation of the story .  the cinematography is fairly neat ,  with lots of the plot taking place in suitably gothic locations .  the girls on board complete what is a pretty picture ,  and what rollin's film lacks in logic and consistency ,  it somewhat makes up for in style .  in the film's defence ,  it was made in 1969 ;  which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but i can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about it that is worth taking note of . 
bo derek's debut film remained unseen for eight years  and that's how it should stayed !  john derek was a competent actor but ,  as a director ,  he's virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema  not that this is especially explicit ,  considering that bo  ( atypically sporting dark hair )  was only 16 when the film was made !  john also wrote and photographed it ;  the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set  but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious !    the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bo's family :  they grew up as brother and sister but ,  now in their teens ,  the couple discover they're attracted to one another  ( but ,  as i said ,  don't expect any sexual fireworks !  )  .  still ,  the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness  hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea-side resort and keeps expecting a cruise-liner to appear into view  ( which ,  of course ,  it does at the finale )  ;  derek's is even nuttier  she craves possession of a large antique bath-tub !  !  for the record ,  the couple are married by the end of the film .   also involved in the non-events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo  ( and who ,  naturally ,  incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten )  .  occasionally ,  for no very good reason ,  we're even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an open-air movie house to which the whole town assembles  ( among the titles shown is the public enemy [1931] )  !  at the end of the day ,  while bo's naivete throughout is undeniably charming ,  it's not enough to offset the film's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness . 
after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb ,  i was extremely pleased with the film .  the film was dark ,  moving ,  the anger ,  the pain ,  the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon .   i had initially expected to see many special effects ,  and like a lover's caress ,  it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it .  brian ,  i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects .  you will go a long way ,  my friend .  i will definitely be the president of your fan club .   eric etebari ,  the best actor award ,  was the number one choice .  you made jr .  lopez look like a child compared to kasadya .   :  )    overall ,  the acting ,  story line ,  the high quality filming and awesome effects ,  it was fantastic .  i just wish it were longer .  i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations . 
nintendo !  !  !  you #%$@ers !  !  !  how could you do this to me ?  i can't believe it .  .  . this movie is actually worse than the first one .  i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along .  .  .  . oh god .  .  . where do i even begin ?  the plot sucked .  the voice acting sucked .  the animation sucked .  the ending really sucked .  if you liked this movie ,  you suck too .  and to futuramafan1987 ,  who said this was the greatest movie ever ,  you are a tool ,  plain and simple .  this isn't a movie for anyone but crack-addled ten-year olds with game boys who think pikachu is god .  i'm still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie .  .  .  . and then there was pikachu's adventure .  .  . don't even get me started on that horrible mess of a film .  it is ,  in all truth ,  one of the most boring experiences of my entire life .  don't go watch this at any costs .   bottom line :  go out ,  find every copy of this movie that you can ,  and burn it .  burn them all ,  and then proceed to rent a good movie ,  like aliens .  .  . or bowling for columbine .  .  . or even back to the future ! 
who was george c .  scott ?  george c .  scott was a renowned actor .  practically any movie that he's been in is the better off for it .  now ol' george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie .  .  .  ,  but he once said something that describes said movie to a t .   i don't recall his exact words ,  but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting ,  but great acting cannot save bad writing .  never has this little observation been truer than in  " the all new adventures of laurel & hardy :  for love or mummy "  .   the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect .  bronson pinchot  ( laurel )  and gailard sartain  ( hardy )  not only look the parts ,  but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal  ( mannerisms and all )  .  this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents .  that said ,  this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to  ( you guessed it )  writing .   aside from the opening dialogue between pinchot and sartain  ( which was very  " in character "  )  and a brief gag involving a taxi ,  this movie is an absolute chore to sit through .   problem # 1 :  too much time and effort went into the plot .   i don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady .  what i want is to see stan and ollie  ( or at least ,  their stand-ins )  .  way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not-very-funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around .   however ,  even if this movie had been all jokes ,  that would still leave us with .  .  .    .  .  . problem # 2 :  most of the jokes are what i would call  " watered-down "  slapstick .    what do i mean by  " watered down "  ?   in slapstick ,  a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect  ( ala looney tunes ,  3 stooges .  .  .  , or how about laurel & hardy ?  )  .   in  " watered-down "  slapstick  ( as i define it )  ,  a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced ,  and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect .   maybe an illustration would help :   in looney tunes ,  daffy duck gets shot by elmer fudd .  his bill falls off and he puts it back on .  that is classic slapstick .   in this  " gem "  ,  ollie accidentally bumps into some people .  they turn around ,  tell him to be careful ,  and continue on their merry way .  that's not slapstick .  that's not even funny .  that's just .  .  . boring .  .  . and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes .  it's as though they're this movie's bread and butter .  the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they're supposed to be funny .  granted ,  the example i just gave is the most extreme case ,  but i can only cut it so much slack .   long story short :  the film just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on pinchot's and sartain's abilities to impersonate stan and ollie .  instead ,  the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes .  watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with .   not a good movie ,  but an incredible sleeping aid .   i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal  ( just so long as you steer clear of  " atoll k "  and  " be big "  )  . 
flavia the heretic is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre - equal parts sleaze ,  feministic journey ,  and  " history "  as we follow flavia on her strange trip .   we start off with flavia in a convent .  .  . she ain't too happy there cuz she doesn't believe in all the male-dominated  " rules "  and macho-ism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her jewish pal ,  abraham .  they are both eventually caught and flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another  " non-believing "  nun in hastening a moslem invasion .  flavia hangs out with the moslems who take over the convent and get  " busy "  with the nuns in a strange set of scenes .  eventually the moslems roll-out and flavia is punished as a traitor to christianity in another singularly brutal scene .  .  .   this one has pretty much all the stuff that i like to see in a 70's era exploit film - some good gore ,  including nipple-removal ,  and a nice leg-skinning scene ,  some decent nudity - including the requisite full-frontal ,  and a decent storyline as well .  i will say that it sorta dragged in a few points ,  but not enough to get truly bored with it .  i would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit/70's exploit fans .  .  . 8/10
iberia is nice to see on tv .  but why see this in silver screen ?  lot of dance and music .  if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie .  but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time .  if you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see bollywood movie .  they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie .  director carlos saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience .  and time to time it's look really good .  but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting .  there are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big . 
this is one of the first films i can remember ,  or maybe the first one .  exactly the beautiful kind of film than introduce a kid ,  sweetly ,  into the world of violence and addictions were we live .  a little bit of babe ,  casino and constantine ,  all this well mixed into a carton ,  and we get this .  i don't know if its truly rated for kids ,  but i think it was very cool ,  very funny and interesting .  i hate when a film  ( spescially a carton ) can have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a happy end ,  even if it sounds weird  ( im not a bitter person )  . but this was ok ,  he simply goes heaven and they let it in that way .   all this is just a critic ,  its a good movie an something new .  very touching and i gotta go
the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth .  hearing david lansbury's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous  " tomorrow ,  tomorrow ,  and tomorrow "  speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role .  i kept believing therefore that he didn't get the part because he was a lousy actor ;  not because a bigger name was available .  then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast ,  misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations .  sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done  ( and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works ) that they settle for less .  this appears to be such an example . 
flat characters that you do not and never will care about .  cringe-inducing dialogue at places .  no twists  ( they think they have one ,  but if you didn't figure it out after about 40mins you're not too bright )  .  lots of well know actors in roles and performances that ,  fortunately for everyone involved ,  will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll .   i don't mind 'slow' movies ,  but they've got to be going _somewhere_ .  this one doesn't .   the plot wasn't what made this a direct-to-dvd movie ,  that's just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy .   the as-of-writing 37 (  !  )  ten  ( 10 )  ratings must be from people involved with the production . 
a must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp ,  or wanted to .  this film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about .  it is funny ,  it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role .  if you have not seen this movie .  . what are you doing ?  get off you butt and run the video store .  have a great summer  :  ) 
this is a film that had a lot to live down to  .  on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and i'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated   to be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word  "  plot  "  is used because as far as i can see there is no plot as such  .  there's something involving russian gangsters  ,  a character called pete thompson who's trying to get his wife sarah pregnant  ,  and an irish bloke called sean  .  how they all fit into something called a  "  plot  "  i'm not sure  .  it's difficult to explain the plots of guy ritchie films but if you watch any of his films i'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing  .  likewise a james bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes  .  you will have a serious problem believing rancid aluminium has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained   taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching  .  sadie frost has appeared in some of the worst british films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent  .  steven berkoff gives acting a bad name  (  and he plays a character called kant which sums up the wit of this movie  )  while one of the supporting characters is played by a tv presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this   the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable  .  i saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching  ,  but by now i've mainly forgotten why  .  but this doesn't alter the fact that i remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
i am starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this film .  do not read further .  .  . here it comes ,  avert your eyes !  the main heroine ,  the girl who always survives in other slasher films ,  is murdered here .  there ,  i just saved you 79 minutes of your life .   this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the '80's .  despite killing the heroine off ,  this is just substandard junk .   both priests and college students get a bad rap here .  they are pictured as oversexed ,  sociopathic morons who have way too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college campus life .  .  . and the college students come off even worse .    " splatter university "  is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do ,  although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape ,  that would be more entertaining .   this is rated  ( r )  for strong physical violence ,  gore ,  profanity ,  very brief female nudity ,  and sexual references .   
please !  do not waste any money on this movie .  it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids .  i couldn't finish watching it ,  and usually i like watching all kinds of b-movies .  how on earth could they find a distributor for it ?  !  !  !  funny however :  check out wikipedia for  " dark area "  .  the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind .  maybe he got loads of money from the producers .  money that should have been spend on actors ,  camera and editing .  even that wouldn't have helped ,  since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film .  unfortunately  " dark area "  has already gotten too much attention .  please ,  director ,  producer and author of this movie ,  stop making movies like that .  .  . you are not doing yourself a favor .  the world would be a better place without this film . 
i don't know who sue kramer ,  the director of this film is ,  but i have a strong suspicion that a )  she is a lesbian and b )  she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic .   i can imagine everyone thinking ,   " my god ,  this is horrible .  not funny .  pedestrian .  totally lame .  "  but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti-gay or they  " don't get "  the gay lifestyle .   ( this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too .  )  anyway ,  it's not even worth reviewing .  the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do .  it's full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing - much less funny .   i hated it and i'm not afraid to say so .  too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb weren't as unbiased in their judgment . 
elvira ,  mistress of the dark  ( 1988 )   directed by :  james signorelli  starring :  cassandra peterson ,  w .  morgan sheppard ,  daniel greene ,  and edie mcclurg  plot :  elvira  ( cassandra peterson )  quits her tv show and heads to the small christian town fallwell ,  massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance ,  hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in vegas .  unfortunately for her ,  all she gets is a creepy old house ,  a poodle ,  and a magic cookbook .  while in fallwell ,  elvira tries to make money ,  breathe some life into the teenagers ,  win the heart of a stud  ( daniel greene )  ,  avoid being burned at the stake ,  and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle  ( w .  morgan sheppard )  ,  who is planning to use the book to end the world .   my thoughts :  i love both cassandra peterson and her alter-ego elvira .  she is a very successful ,  beautiful ,  and funny woman and as elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive ,  not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers .  in this movie ,  her charms are put to good use .   i loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film .  you got elvira ,  with her low-cut black dress ,  her big black hair ,  and her enormous 'twins' ,  and she's in a christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup .  this also makes her love story with bob  ( daniel greene )  a lot more entertaining .   w .  morgan sheppard is equally great as elvira's uncle/nemesis vincent ,  out to steal the book to use it for evil .  he has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from elvira .   what really makes the film is not the plot ,  but the many jokes .  everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a scary movie sequel .  i hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film ,  and any fan of roger corman b-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film .   if you love elvira ,  you will love this flick .  also check out elvira's haunted hills . 
this movie is a waste of time and money .  throughout the entire hour and a half ,  i continued to wait for it to get better and it never did .  it was slow moving ,  the plot jumped around ,  it wasn't scary or interesting ,  and really never amounted to anything .  the credits during the introduction were long and drawn out ,  which was basically like the rest of the movie  ( long and drawn out )  .  numerous parts of the plot made no sense .  several times during the movie i had thought that maybe i had  " zoned out "  because the incongruity of the plot ,  however ,  my companion had the same issue and assured me i did not  " zone out "  from boredom ,  but it was indeed the movie .  i've actually never posted on here about a movie before and have been actively looking up movies on imdb for numerous years .  so the fact that i'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it . 
the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simon's play about a retired vaudevillian team ,  played by walter matthau and george burns ,  who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that .  the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other .  richard benjamin appears as matthau's nephew ,  a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality .  this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment .  .  . vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simon's better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau ,  burns ,  and benjamin .  burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this ,  but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark .  matthau was nominated for best actor but didn't stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoo's nest ;  however ,  in another year ,  this was an oscar-worthy performance .  matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance .  the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can't get the name of the product right is a classic .  the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns . 
well since seeing part's 1 through 3 i can honestly say that they should have never made part 4 .  everything from the tacky ,  and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting ,  i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds .   i mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion ,  but without him around in this one it's just not the same .  sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story line's ,  but it was a good closure at the end of the third one .  again there was no reason for a part 4 .  even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sh*t i had to sit through ,  lol .  there goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again . 
i've been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons :   1 )  this is ,  without doubt ,  the worst film i've ever seen 2 )  unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list - which it deserves to be 3 )  i was kinda lucky - i paid five pound for it .  i've seen it in shops for 15 pound .  don not pay that much for this film !  you will be very angry 4 )  there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating  ( in my opinion )  and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal  the plot summary :  a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well ,  the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else .  our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings ,  baby-sitting .  he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police .   why is it so bad ?  to begin with the acting is very very bad .  someone else compared it to a school production .  no ,  this is worse than any acting i've seen on a school stage .   i've bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this .  okay ,  the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense .  what was the point in making this film when there isn't even any gore !  okay ,  no gore .  what else can a film like this offer ?  breats ?  no ,  not even any titillation !   it's true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyer/watcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is ,  at best ,  worth only one out of ten . 
sorry my fellow nevada city neighbors ,  but this one is bad .   brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie .   alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside .  she was stiff throughout the movie .   i looked up both alice and brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work .  i would have guessed that they were first-year students .   ed asner and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line .  ed certainly has not lost his charisma .  i wish i'd taken the time to meet him while he was here .   i love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because i've been there .  i make nevada city my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere .  i was sadly disappointed .   sorry . 
well ,  i'll start by admitting i'm not a john ford fan .   ( i watched  " the informer "  only because i'm trying to work my way through a list of the  " greats .  "  )  so if you are ,  just move along ,  'cause you're not going to agree with me .   what an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is !  i will say that there is a good idea for a movie here  ( it made me think about how few films there are about the irish revolution )  but ,  as usual ,  ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment .  i suppose it's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the  " talkies "  -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue .   ( of course ,  title cards would prevent ford from restating every bit of emotion six times .  )  what dialogue there is usually has a  " they're always after me lucky charms !  "  quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an irish accent .  of course ,  as bad as they are ,  the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some german expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over .   ( it feels as if ,  with an eagle eye ,  you might see some villagers off to torch dr .  frankenstein in the background .  )   techniques change .  tastes change .  so i won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day .  but it's not one of the classics that hold up --- more just  " fair warning "  about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which ford was going to devote his career . 
first off ,  i would like to point out that while i am not an expert ,  the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence .  firstly ,  the prosecution never proved that 'facilitated learning' actually works .  irresponsible for both the prosecution ( because they can get an appeal )  and the defense for not acting on this .  as another commenter said ,  facilitated learning was proved untrue .  secondly ,  they used terry as the translator who has personal interest ,  and even will testify ,  in the trial which is just stupid .  if the court had allowed him to testify that way ,  they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal .  thirdly ,  this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution ( birthmarks ,  details of the event ,  etc .  )  and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started ,  he could not answer .  if that isn't reasonable doubt i don't know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an acquittal .   bottom line ,  it starts off well with the pressures of being the parent of a child with autism ,  but the trial makes this movie wholly unbelievable . 
grand canyon falls under a very scarce category :  it is a very clever film ,  with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end .  i have the impression that it never made it to it's deserved ranking  ( and never will )  ,  because of it's simplicity .  this kind of flick needs sensitive watchers .  pity thought that imdb makes me write ten lines ,  because this is in no way necessary in this particular case .  anyway in order to fulfill this request ,  i will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting :  not that it is bad but it could have been done much better .  exception made for kevin kline who was perfect .  go ahead and watch it . 
this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw it .   my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in '92 .  i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairs .   she was saying something like  " don't let her get me "  or something like that .  i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she'd been watching the woman in black .   so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me .  it scared the s*** out of me .  i've been immune to horror films since watching this ! 
/the first episode i saw of lost made me think ,  i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster .  but it's not like that ,  it's far more than that , because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost  ,  well it's getting better every time .  a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed .  that's the real secret .   this series rules and i can't wait to know what's really going on there i hope that they don't air the last 2 episodes in the theaters , this series deserves a 9 out of 10
this movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a mom  ( lisa hartman black )  who acts like a man would in an action thriller .  unlike other movies where the focus is on the police ,  here the mom is tracking down her ex-husband who kidnapped their son .  she gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her .   before finally catching up with her son ,  a lot of bizarre things happen .  the mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local children's play at a community theater .  she gets caught ,  and then realizes it is not her child .  that alone would have gotten most people put into the mental ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial .  however ,  in this movie the mom is release after a couple of hours because the victim's parents feel sorry for her .  a little while later mom breaks into her mother-in-law's house and then the police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her  ( and feel sorry for her ?  )  .   at another point in the story they have found the child ,  but when the police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the dad kept around just for such an emergency escape !  the mom gets someone to lend her a raft ,  and even though it must have taken some time  ( in a real world )  ,  she and the lawyer-boyfriend ,  and the police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall .  instead of getting out of the raft to search for the dad on the land ,  mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life-jacket .  of course ,  she cannot swim and sinks like a rock .  the lawyer saves her ,  but they miss a chance to run after the dad .  at one point the mom is told her son died at a clinic in mexico .  on and on it goes ,  and where it stops nobody knows !  in some ways ,  this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive .  on the other hand ,  seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun  ( or funny ?  )  . 
eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in egypt .  really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century .  i also didn't realize the series flopped .  there is a second season airing now isn't there ?  it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill-informed or don't watch a show at all .  it is a waste of space on the boards and of other's time .  the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place ,  but that is to be expected from any show .  the remainder of the first season is excellent .  i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states . 
brokedown palace is truly a one of a kind .  it's an amazing story ,  showing two girl's plight for freedom against the thailand justice system .  they soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about .   alice morano  ( claire danes )  and darlene davis  ( kate beckinsale )  ,  are two best friends ,  strait out of high school .  they suddenly change their vacation plans from hawaii to thailand ,  and are immediately captivated by a young man ,  nick parks .  he flirts with them both ,  and suggests that the three of them go to hong kong for the weekend .   when the two arrive at the airport ,  they are immediately searched for drugs .  someone tipped off customs ,  and in an instant ,  their life is changed forever .  in the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life ,  they learn about a highly respected lawyer ,  named hank green  ( bill pullman )  .   an american who knows the thai justice system ,  he fights for the girl to be free .  but they soon find out ,  when they leave or go is all up to them .   if you're looking for a great movie that'll stay with you for years - brokedown palace is definitely the way to go . 
one of ,  if not the worst film to come out of britain in the 80s .    this tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it .   in turns gratuitous ,  puerile ,  uncouth and unrealistic ,  this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny ,  provocative ,  intellectual and controversial .    perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george costigan ,  michelle holmes and siobhan finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script .  it's no surprise that this was the late andrea dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen .  complete and utter rubbish on every level . 
well then ,  thank you so much disney for destroying the fond memories i used to have of my former favorite movie .  i was about 5 when the original movie came out ,  and it was one of the first movies i remember seeing .  so ,  now that i'm 16 ,  and feeling masochistic enough ,  i decided to rent this movie .  thus ,  i managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie .  this movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it ,  right down to the last detail .   in this movie ,  ariel and eric celebrate the birth of their daughter ,  melody ,  and go to show her to everyone in the ocean .  .  . broadway style !  after the musical number ends ,  within minutes ,  the sea witch morgana shows up and threatens to kill melody if triton doesn't give up the trident .  thus ,  he gives it up without even a fight .  eric stands there gaping ,  though ariel figures out how to use a sword and save melody .  morgana escapes ,  so ariel and eric decide that melody should never go near the sea until morgana is caught .   well .  .  . uh ,  nothing of note really happens .  eric is a total wuss .  he never really manages to do anything .  ariel sort of does something .  melody manages to screw things up .  plus ,  the animation is a new low-point for disney .  the computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds .  ever single opportunity for character development is wasted .  the songs bite .   look ,  don't waste your time .  i'm pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this ,  since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens .  they won't want to sing the songs .  if you manage to grab a copy of this ,  throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it .  ever . 
this film is so old i never realized how young looking ray milland looked in 1936 ,  i remember him playing in a great film ,   " lost weekend "  .  ray plays the role of michael stuart ,  who is a very rich banker .  there are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy .  they hire a man to pose as a very rich count ,  his name is count ariszted ,   ( misha auer )  who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture .  deanna durbin ,   ( penny craig )  surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard ,  the entire police department and convicts started applauding ,  which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film .  this is deanna durbin's first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with universal studios after leaving mgm . 
a demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life .  honest this is the plot of the movie .  he try's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body .  for some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin .  the sleaze style of the movie is laughable .  no one in the movie can actually act including the head .  the closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell .  the plot is slow ,  weak and the ending is so badly done .  watch the mystery science theater 3000 version of this move .  believe me folks i wouldn't watch this movie on its own . 
apparently ,  the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood .  i use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director andy copp's commentary  ( which i didn't have available to me )  or reading up on the film prior to watching ,  viewers won't have a clue what it is about .   gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage ,  but unless they're also fond of pretentious ,  headache-inducing ,  experimental art-house cinema ,  they'll find this one a real chore to sit through .   82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound ,  terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue ,  this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity :  if you've still got all your marbles ,  you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead  ( i watched the whole thing ,  but am well aware that i'm completely barking !  )  . 
during the first 3 seasons fairly odd parents was as tasty as hard candy ,  bright and sweet and addictive .  now it's as tasty as pepto-bismol .  and unfortunately pepto-bismol is what you'll need after viewing the more recent episodes ,  where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs .  cosmo ,  once one of the more endearing nick characters ,  has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of family guy wouldn't even want to know .  timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that bart simpson would happily beat the snot out of  ( and given timmy's snottiness ,  that would take a lot of beating )  .  and poor wanda .  .  . a real charmer who's become the victim of her husband and godchild ,  she's now labeled a  " nag "  for caring about the well-being of others .  plus cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he's never punished for it ,  nor does he learn any lessons .  which pretty much sums up butch hartman's attitude towards kids :  they're crude ,  vulgar and not too bright .  thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled ,  along with butch hartman's darling ,  danny phantom .  at least butch got what he deserved - unlike cosmo . 
obviously has some talent attached ,  maria bello is always great .  but this is just a dreary wast of time ,  portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an 'interesting' story .  well ,  i hope they got it out of their systems .  unfortunately for the audience ,  there is no insight ,  no sensitivity ,  no context ,  and really no humanity .  which would all be fine ,  except it has no humor ,  no horror ,  no context ,  and nothing constructive to say about the story it's trying to tell .  bad things happen ,  you sit and watch it ,  you don't care ,  so what ?  99% of the time ,  the words 'based on a true story' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience .  it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere ,  so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work .  i hope they had a great time making this movie .  it stinks on ice . 
the original is a relaxing watch ,  with some truly memorable animated sequences .  unfortunately ,  the sequel ,  while not the worst of the dtv sequels completely lacks the sparkle .   the biggest letdown is a lack of a story .  like belle's magical world ,  the characters are told through a series of vignettes .  magical world ,  while marginally better ,  still manages to make a mess of the story .  in between the vignettes ,  we see the mice at work ,  and i personally think the antics of jaq and gus are the redeeming merits of this movie .   the first vignette is the best ,  about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess .  this is the best ,  because the mice were at their funniest here .  the worst of the vignettes ,  when jaq turns into a human ,  is cute at times ,  but has a lack of imagination .  the last vignette ,  when anastasia falls in love ,  was also cute .  the problem was ,  i couldn't imagine anastasia being friendly with cinderella ,  as i considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters .  this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompom .   the incidental music was very pleasant to listen to ; however i hated the songs ,  they were really uninspired ,  and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original .   the characters were the strongest development here .  cinderella while still caring ,  had lost her sincerity ,  and a lot of her charm from the original ,  though she does wear some very pretty clothes .  the duke had some truly funny moments but they weren't enough to save the film ,  likewise with prudence and the king .  as i mentioned ,  the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie ,  as they alone contributed to the film's cuteness .  i have to say also the animation is colourful and above average ,  and the voice acting was surprisingly good .   all in all ,  a cute ,  if unoriginal sequel ,  that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story .  4/10 for the mice ,  the voice acting ,  the animation and some pretty dresses .  bethany cox
if only all animation was this great .  this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects :  story and character .  the characters in this film are beautifully personified .  i felt for all of the characters ,  and human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly .  the beautiful animation and 3-d computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film .  this is a great movie for kids ,  and for adults who want a classic hero's journey .  8 of 10 . 
i only watched this film from beginning to end because i promised a friend i would .  it lacks even unintentional entertainment value that many bad films have .  it may be the worst film i have ever seen .  i'm surprised a distributor put their name on it . 
 " how to lose friends & alienate people "  is not based on tiger woods' infidelities .  it is a mediocre romantic comedy based on toby young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities .  the film stars simon pegg as sidney young ,  a zany british journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in new york .  young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him ,  hence movie title .  he is uproarious ,  daring ,  and moronic .  but nevertheless for some very bizarre reason ,  he is a somewhat likable character .  sidney befriends a fellow journalist ,  the composed alison olsen ,  played quite admirably by kirsten dunst .  however ,  sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress sophie maes played by the fantastic ms .  megan fox .  this foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on  " eye candy "  material .  sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co .  those are the peak comedic moments of the film .  however ,  i think that director robert weide and screenwriter peter straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between sidney & alison ;  even though team weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise .  pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as sidney young .  jeff bridges was again building  " the dude "  bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as clayton harding ,  the magazine's suave prez .  but the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here .   " how to lose friends & alienate people "  should not be alienated entirely ,  but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy .  *** average
first and foremost ,  zorie barber  ( zeke )  ,  might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen .  as a character that's supposed to be a hip ,  village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious ,  why is he so hyper ,  over-dramatic ,  and plain horrible ?  did he know anything about his character before they started filming ?  did the director ?  don't the martial arts teach discipline ?  aside from that ,  this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen-it-already gross-out humor .  hand in toilet ?  <i>trainspotting</i> .  masturbation ?  hmm .  <i>fast times at ridgemont high</i> ,  <i>american pie</i> ,  the list goes on .  .   . bad dialogue :  in one sequence ,  eric says  " it's none of my business <i>but</i>  .   .  .  .  "  and 30 seconds later mia says  " why is this any of your business ?  "  bad editing :  at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots .  <hr>it's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight-knit group of friends in any world .  i can't comment on what makes everyone laugh ,  but if you enjoy low-brow ,  basic bathroom humor and insults ,  by all means ,  enjoy .  if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines ,  see <i>boomerang</i> .  if you want a solid what-goes-around romantic comedy ,  go for <i>the tao of steve</i> .  but anyone who thinks <i>whipped</i> is witty and an accurate portrayal dating ,  well ,  i cannot agree at all . 
absolutely stunning ,  warmth for the head and the heart .  the kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed ,  too frenetic to even attempt .  my kids watched it ,  and they loved it too .  what real people--goes to show you how cultural differences  ( the japanese setting )  is less important than the human similarities .  go see it ,  whether you like dancing or not . 
this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone .  on my list of favorite movies  ( mental list ,  mind )  the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series ,  spirited away and fly away home .   i can really relate to the main character jess .  at the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls .  she really sucks you into her life .  i also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting ,  or anyone else's in the film .   the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules .  the movie is never boring .  the romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard !  one thing that really made it though was the indian factor .  jess' parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else .  the indian people are also hilarious !  essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it .   feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film .  they're funny ,  they're refreshing and they make you feel good !  ^_~
poor whoopi goldberg .  imagine her at a friend's dinner party ,  and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion going on .  people just look at her and say ,   " oh what would you know ,  you were the star of 'theodore rex' "  .  how could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap ?  even little kids would be cringing in horror at this thing .  it reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'sigmund and the sea monsters' .  actually ,  come to think of it ,  'sigmund' was vastly superior to this .   and however did it get made ?  by plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it ?  watch this hideous abomination at your own peril . 
i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels :  well ,  this transposition is simply accurate ,  intelligent ,  delicate ,  careful ,  tactful ,  respectful ,  intense ,  in a word ,  perfect !    " emma "  is one of austen's most delightful and funny novels ,  thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters .  the movie respected this subtle irony ,  not disregarding the comic element  ( miss bates above all )  .  what engaged me in the novel ,  and the movie renders it clearly ,  is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist ,  and the modern look with which women ,  men ,  and their relation are handled ,  and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century ,  who lived almost a secluded life ,  could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did :  that most and still fascinates me .  we can feel this modernity throughout the movie :  just replace costumes ,  and use a more current language but the situations ,  the feelings ,  the ideas would be extremely modern .  i think of the morbid interest in other people's lives ,  or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations ,  and still the difficulty in revealing ,  and giving expression to one's feelings ,  especially love :  every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value .    the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances :  a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role  ( nowadays she would be probably too mature for it )  ,  toni colette is simply great .  and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear !  and then ,  the breathtaking english countryside ,  where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension .  .  .  a really enjoyable and deserving movie . 
i read so many comments that i ,  too ,  shared about remembering this movie and wanting so badly to see it again but i didn't know the name of the movie .  thankfully ,  because of doing a search and finding the title on this site ,  i read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie i remembered .  i then did a search and did find the movie and was so thrilled to be able to watch the movie once more 40 years later .  because of this site and your comments ,  you helped me and so i want to thank all of you .  i want to share how i was able to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well .  it was on the vhs version of wonderful world of disney's  " call it courage "  which contained 2 movies ,  the second one being  " the legend of the boy and the eagle .  "  it touched me now as much as it did 40 years ago and now i own my own copy of it .  i think it is only available on vhs .  i found it on ebay and i have seen several copies of it there .  enjoy it ,  i know i did !   it is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he took care of .  when it was time to sacrifice the eagle ,  the boy set the eagle free because he couldn't allow it to be killed .  after the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after freeing the eagle ,  the eagle ,  too ,  saved the boy's life and more than that ,  taught him how to survive .  the closeness that the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so moving and the filming was really remarkable .  what a wonderful era this was .  i have never seen anything come even close to this movie ! 
originally conceived as a solo vehicle for dudley moore ,  'not only .  .  . but also' saw his ex-'beyond the fringe' collaborator peter cook guest on the first show ,  and so well received was it the controller of b . b . c . -2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on .  they were a classic comedy team - cook was tall ,  handsome and witty ,  while dudley was short ,  charismatic ,  and musically gifted .  the sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub ,  wearing flat caps and mufflers ,  fantasising about movie stars such as jane russell and greta garbo .  it remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time ,  and even when cook corpses it still holds together well .   those characters - idiot pete and even-bigger idiot dud - found their way into every episode of the show proper ,  seen in a different setting ,  such as a zoo or an art gallery .  in the latter ,  they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art .   " that leonardo davinci cartoon .  .  . i don't see the joke !  "  ,  says dud .  pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits .  dud nearly chokes on his repast .   " you really are enjoying those sandwiches !  "  ,  ad libs cook .  the pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold .  the sketches themselves set new standards for comedy ,  standards that would not be matched until the arrival of 'monty python' .   as the show's popularity increased ,  so did the quality of the guest stars .  peter sellers for instance ,  and john lennon ,  the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem 'deaf ted ,  danoota ,  & me' .  'one leg too few' - had dud as 'george spigott'  (  a name later re-used in the film 'bedazzled'  )  ,  a one-legged man ,  who hops into the office of film producer cook to audition for the role of 'tarzan' .  cook tries to let him down as best as he can .   " i've nothing against your right leg !  "  ,  he says .   " the trouble is - neither have you !  "  .   dud would on occasion interview the eccentric sir arthur streeb-greebling  (  cook  )  ,  who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater ,  was planning on opening a restaurant called 'the frog & the peach' .  another classic was 'the leaping nuns'  (  also reused in 'bedazzled'  )  .  but my all-time favourite has to be 'superthunderstingcar' ,  a wickedly funny  (  and accurate  )  parody of gerry and sylvia anderson's 'thunderbirds' .  pete and dud played all the roles ,  with the latter making a fetching 'lady penelope' .  'ludwig' had ludwig van beethoven as the star of a 'this is tom jones' style variety show .  'the immortal bargo' was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star 'emma bargo' .  in an unforgettable moment ,  she drove through london ,  bellowing through a loudhailer :   " i want to be alone !  "  .   a season 3 feature was 'poets cornered' with the likes of ronnie barker ,  spike milligan ,  barry humphries ,  willie rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank .  they each had to improvise the line of a poem ,  and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff .   three seasons were made in all ,  produced  (  at different times  )  by joe mcgrath ,  dick clement and jimmy gilbert .  sadly very few editions survive .  to make matters worse ,  the scripts were destroyed as well .  it beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen .   the show ended in 1970 .  the comics then hit broadway ,  made the infamous 'derek & clive' tapes ,  but cook's ever-increasing alcoholism broke them apart .  eight years later ,  cook announced that a new series was in the offing ,  but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part .  his ex-partner was making films in america ,  and had no intention of working with cook again  (  not at that time anyway  )  .   enough footage was scraped together for a season of b . b . c . -2 repeats in the early '90's .  as expected ,  some items had not held up as well as others .  cook died in 1995 ,  and by way of a tribute the b . b . c put together a programme compiled from various 'parkinson' interviews and 'not only .  .  . but also' shows .  it ended rather appropriately with pete and dud finding themselves in heaven .   " bloody hell !  "  ,  exclaimed the latter .  moore passed on in 2002 . 
this film is one of those nostalgia things with me and i never really expect anyone else to  " get it "  but am pleased when i recommend it and somebody does enjoy it .  my late father hated arthur askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for  " the ghost train "  and  " old ted 'olmes "  transferred to me as a child .  years later ,  i watch it every now and again ,  enjoying the familiarity .  i always wonder if it will not be quite the same but i am never disappointed in it .  there is much to enjoy .  the sequence on the train is truly inspired when askey and murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger .  then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up .  yes ,  it is dated and full of wartime britishness in accents and plot  ( based on the original play by arnold ridley of dad's army fame !  )  but full of wonderful character performances - including kathleen harrison as a dotty spinster .  the atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an arthur askey vehicle could get .  this is available cheap as chips in the uk on dvd so treat yourself .  it is a perfect saturday/sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment .  i thank you .  .  .  .   old movies can be good movies ! 
unfortunately ,  this movie is so bad .  the original out of towners was manic and very funny ,  of course they used the script written by neil simon .  for some reason neil simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again .  even the audience i was with never laughed .  the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i . e .  the couple having sex in the park .  they announce it is a lighting ceremony for new york ,  well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging goldie & steve do a bit of slap stick .  the whole movie winds up being like this .  .  . a joke is set up and given away .  why isn't goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie .  you will also notice every close up of goldie  ( they use a very intense soft lens )  .  i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis ,  that's if you want to laugh . 
 " someones at the door "  .  ohhh ,  how i miss this show so bad .  .  but we are lucky to now have  " invasion "  .  thank you ,  shawn cassidy .  american gothic ,  had it all . if i had to pick one thing that i liked best about the show ,  it has to be its  " not predictable plot-lines "  .  favorite actor was lucas black .  .  i adore that southern accent .  i bought the dvd asap ,  and my kids are fans too .  there is some hot n steamy scenes .  some devilish ones too .  so ,  if kiddos will be watching you may want to edit ( fastforward/skip )  .  it has humour ,  on a joss wheedon level ,  which so many shows lack .  adult wit and adult situation ,  that are handled with finese .  the dvd has some extras ,  but i wish it has many more .  if you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show ,  come watch  " american gothic "  ! 
i remember trying a few minutes of this film ,  i'm very surprised i didn't watch all of it ,  from director steve gordon ,  his only film directed before dying of heart failure .  basically arthur bach  ( golden globe winning ,  and oscar nominated dudley moore )  is the happy drunk millionaire with everything he could want ,  a mansion ,  a butler hobson  ( oscar and golden globe winning ,  and bafta nominated sir john gielgud )  ,  and plenty of booze .  he is to inherit $750 , 000 , 000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire burt johnson  ( stephen elliott )  ,  they woman he and the family have chosen ,  susan  ( jill eikenberry )  .  but instead ,  arthur finds himself falling for queens waitress linda marolla  ( golden globe nominated liza minnelli )  ,  which of course is threatening the inheritance ,  and 3/4 of his family's fortune from father stanford  ( thomas barbour )  and aunt martha  ( geraldine fitzgerald )  .  after the death of hobson ,  arthur ,  on the day of the wedding ,  disobeys the family's wishes ,  but aunt martha still gives arthur the inheritance to live happily ever after with true love linda .  also starring ted ross as bitterman ,  barney martin as ralph marolla ,  anne de salvo as gloria - hooker ,  maurice copeland as uncle peter bach ,  justine johnston as aunt pearl bach ,  florence tarlow as mrs .  nesbitt ,  marcella lowery as harriet - martha's maid ,  john bentley as perry and peter evans as preston langley - party guest .  moore is wonderfully funny and a little cringing as the almost always drunk millionaire ,  minnelli is likable as the woman he loves ,  and gielgud of course makes a great oscar winning impression as moore's humorous humble sarcastic servant ,  a terrific screwball comedy .  it won the oscar for best song for  " arthur's theme  ( best that you can do )  "   ( it also won the golden globe )   ( it was number 79 on 100 years ,  100 songs )  ,  and it was nominated best writing ,  screenplay written directly for the screen ,  it was nominated the bafta anthony asquith award for film music for burt bacharach ,  and it won the golden globe for best motion picture - comedy/musical .  sir john gielgud was number 35 on the 50 greatest british actors ,  and the film was number 53 on 100 years ,  100 laughs .  very good ! 
this is one of the all-time great  " our gang "  shorts .  spanky is at his very cutest and funniest ,  and the babies that he get's left to babysit are also hilarious .  tiny spanky is coerced by the gang into watching all their little siblings .  the opening shot of them all in baby carriages ,  being entertained by various things hung by the gang from fishing poles is a beautiful gag .   spanky's appearance wearing his huge toy knife when asked to babysit by the older fellows is priceless ,  as is his response -- " hey ,  where do you get that stuff -- i don't take care of no babies !  "  the tiny fellow saying  " remarkable "  throughout the film ,  all the beautiful sight gags ,  and spanky telling the babies  " all about tarzan "  add up to make this one of the best  " our gang " 's you'll ever see . 
what a boring film !  to sum it all up ,  its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter-in-law karisma kapoor ,  while she tried to flee from the village ,  with her son .  can someone say boring ?  ?  ?  the concept wasn't too bad ,  but it was poorly executed .  the canadian locales ,  and some of the village scenes were nicely shot .  however ,  overall the cinematography came up short .  the story could have been great ,  but the movie just seemed to drag on .  there is only so much stupidity a person can take ,  let alone three bloody hours of it .   the best part of the whole movie was the song  " ishq kamina "  ,  and that was only five minutes long .  other than that ,  this movie was a piece of crap . 
the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman  ( writer of mirrormask )  and it's really a good story .  i think it would appeal to any labyrinth ,  princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own .  and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman .  i won't spoil it for you .   the main character ,  tristan  ( tristran in the novel )  ,  is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie .  the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world .  when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with .  he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too .  three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again ,  and some bickering princes .   it's a really good story .  it has humor and magic and beautiful ,  surreal scenes and visuals .  it's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages .  it's simply magical .  it's a true classic fairy tale ,  the likes of which i haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s . 
this is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything french and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in fanfan la tulipe .  portrayed by the splendid gerard philippe ,  the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry king louis xv's daughter !  problem is ,  la lollo soon find outs she too is in love with fanfan .  .  .   propelled by good sword fights ,  cavalcades ,  and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments .  the direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that i could not give those shortcomings a second thought .  look out for noel roquevert ,  a traditional heavy in french films ,  trying to steal la lollo ,  making himself a nuisance ,  and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads la lollo's hand !  and what a gem marcel herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven king louis xv !  that is not all :  so many beautiful women in one film makes me wish i were in france and on the set back in 1952 !  the film may have come out that year but its verve ,  cheek ,  superb narration ,  immaculate photography and the memorable gerard philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch .  i would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular !  do see it ! 
i'm surprised no-one has thought of doing a movie like this before .  horror is often most effective when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme .  and nobody  ( except for steve martin in the little shop of horrors )  likes going to the dentist .  tooth torture has been done before  ( see the marathan man for example )  ,  but this brings the terror into suburbia .   the plot revolves around a dentist ,  dr .  alan feinstone  ( corbin bernsen )  ,  who descends into madness .  now our dear doctor wasn't playing with a full deck to begin with ,  but driven by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder he begins to reek havoc on those around him .  the doctors spiraling mental condition is kinda close to what we see in micheal douglas's character in falling down ,  but with a horror edge .   written and directed by horror stalwarts stuart gordon and brian yuzna ,  its witty and has a great flow .  also featured playing a cop ,  is the ever welcome ken foree .   now i believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance from corbin bernsen .  having really only seen him in la law before ,  i was blown away by his acting .   the sequel the dentist 2 is also worth watching ,  but slightly under par compared to the original .   ttkk's bottomline - a fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe ,  capped  ( pun intended )  by a great performance from bernsen
listening to the soundtrack at the moment ,  the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong  ( in order to be able to type this )  .  i've seen it twice thus far ,  and i should be ashamed for having seen it *only* twice .   i've seen all miyazaki & studio ghibli films ,  and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces  ( except maybe for nausicaa which was ,  even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga )  .  still ,  their strength sometimes becomes their weakness ,  as they tend to get too naive/positive  ( chihiro )  ,  or ,  with more nuance ,  a bit too explicit/moralist  ( mononoke )  .  at least ,  compared to for example the other ghibli master takahata  ( grave of the fireflies / only yesterday / raccoon wars )  .  but not this one .   in laputa ,  miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages ,  combined with a bit of morale ,  but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere ,  but also with the humor and amusement of for example totoro .  every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties .  the pacing is so perfect that i know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being .  the story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at ,  but when the girl falls from the sky ,  unconscious ,  floating with the stone ,  and the main theme kicks in ,  you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover ,  but the story then settles and gradually ,  over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty ,  builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy ,  hope ,  beauty - like ,  following days of sombre gloom ,  finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning ,  knowing the path walked ,  seeing the distance ahead ,  but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it .   it is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb ,  you should see a therapist .   despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent miyazakis might be more overwhelming ,  this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece .  if you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986 ,  you can only come to the conclusion that hayao miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years .  this of course has been suggested before ,  but to me this is his only film that can ,  on its own ,  fully illustrate that simple fact .  if you miss this during your lifetime ,  you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity ,  as the coffin costs the same . 
i'm a writer working at home and diagnosis murder is my lunchtime break companion - good ,  clean fun ,  good humour and nostalgia for the days of the dick van dyke show .  how innocent we all were  ( and how innocent is diagnosis murder )  .  i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe mannix .  the bad guys always get caught ,  the good guys carry on .  the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously .   one beef :  why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches ?  amanda was too dizzy .  its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an autopsy .   i hope we haven't seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens ,  esp .  at lunchtimes !  ! 
nothing is fantastic !  simple as that !  it's a film that shouldn't work ,  yet does .  natali stays in the realm of sci-fi ,  however this film is also a comedy .  cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali  ( at $7 . 5million !  woo-hoo pa !  )  so with nothing he scales down again .  this is low budget ,  independent film-making at it's best .  simple ,  good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood's usual reasons for mostly financial gain .  nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask ,  no it is not anything like seinfeld !  basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers .  they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways .  andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out .  dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with .  by bizarre mis-fortunes however ,  dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work-place incriminating dave ,  and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout  ( canadian humour people !  )  .  as it turns out andrew's house is to be demolished as well and he can't stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on .  both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling .  they are desperate and can't escape ,  and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white .  what has happened ?  have dave and andrew died ?  they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet .  no police ,  no demolition team ,  no angry girl scout mother !  what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to  " wish or hate away .  "  as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world .  they are left alone .  the house is surrounded by nothing ,  which is portrayed as pure white .  so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white .  the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water ,  they begin to tire of each other .  they discover they can hate away hunger ,  which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say .  i can't reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold .   this film is quirky ,  funny ,  interesting .  the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube ,  david hewlett ,  and andrew millar to lead the film .  they have chemistry and also work very well .  they have to hold 90% of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background ,  yet it works .  certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states .  nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers .   natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature .  i prey to god he doesn't do the proposed necropolis ,  written and directed by add sufferer ,  the ever crap paul anderson .  vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad ,  run !  !  !  run like the wind !  !  i hope and prey this guy doesn't take to hollywood like alex proyas did  ( with the enjoyable yet pussy-footed ,  sugar coated ,  helium light :  i robot !  )  .  keep your eyes peeled for this guy .  ****
i saw this movie when i was a child .  it blew me away .  this was before the days of television ,  so a movie of this magnitude ,  could send a young kid into orbit .  it so impressed me ,  that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days .  the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time .  sabu was a real delight ,  as was rex ingram as the genie .  i found myself singing  " i want to be a sailor "  for months after the film left town .  i would recommend this movie to any and everyone .  i forgot to mention conrad veidt ,  who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet .  also ,  june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture .  the color was outstanding .  give this movie an aaa ! 
i honestly have to say that i could not stop watching this movie from the second that it started .  simply for how bad it was !  !  !  it's kinda like watching paint dry only a lot more confusing .  i mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen ,  anything in fact ,  preferably something that makes the whole film make sense !  at the end of the film i actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all that i may have missed the first hour that explained everything or whether i may have inadvertently passed out during the film and missed the parts that glued the plot ( if there was in fact one ) together !  the main thing that really confused me about this movie ,  is nearly at the end the main girl  ( if there was indeed a main girl )  was in some sort of alternate reality ,  i mean what the hell was going on at this point ?  !  all of a sudden she awoke and was in a mental institute ,  chained to a bed being drugged by doctors or something ,  then quicker than it would have taken me to slit my wrists ,  it flipped back and she was getting eaten out by some random vampire ! it made no sodding sense !  i'm tempted to email the makers and demand my time back ,  i mean i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbish ! i am kinda interested to know if the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about !  just seemed someone had edited out all the bits that could have made it make sense though i think the film would have had to have been 4hrs long to make that happen !  i side completely with the other person who wrote the other review ,  i was duped royally with this film by its title ,  and that alone .  i'm just so sodding grateful i didn't actually buy the film ,  no matter how many times iv seen it in the local pound shop .  you would have thought that would have given me a clue that the film was a complete pile of steaming movie rubbish but to be honest i think £1 was way too much money to spend on this film !  !  !  !  what a sodding huge waste of time and a good razor blade ,  i mean i wish i od'ed ,  its less painful than watching this film !  !  !  ! 
rain or shine outside ,  you enter a movie house .  it makes you happy .   ( if not ,  come right out .  )  lights go off .  you settle down with a bar of ice cream .  moving pictures begin to flicker on the screen .  you feel content .  in the dark ,  you are back in the beginning of time .  sitting around the campfire .  .  . looking at the modern version of the flickering flames 24 times per second and sharing the joy of discovering the unknown turns and twists of the scenario with rest of your clan/spectators .   those who are not happy with themselves ,  should not write comments .

the good earth is a great movie !  !  ! everybody must see .  .  . it is tear-jerking and very heart warming .  it caters to the enhancement of values-formation on perseverance ,  humility and the love of family .  .  . the story can be related to our life today especially that poverty is at the threshold .  the way on how we respond to such problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to face such ,  he may be left defenseless and useless .  i am very pleased on how the characters justified their roles even the young actors .  .  . their emotions has captivated the audience .  the movie may have been done in black and white ,  but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end .  that makes it really great !  there should be a re-make for this very nice movie . 
 .  .  . or ,  more precisely ,  so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it !  james sbardellati's  " deathstalker "  of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword & sorcery sub-genre has brought along ,  but it is highly amusing .  the acting is terrible ,  the plot is pure crap ,  and the effects and photography couldn't be more amateurish .  but it is the bad acting ,  the cheesy effects ,  and the many errors ,  that makes this movie so hilarious .   - spoilers ahead -  deathstalker  ( rick hill )  is an extremely strong and skilled warrior .  one day ,  a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation ,  a sword ,  an amulet and a chalice ,  in order to free the country from its brutal ruler ,  the evil king and sorcerer munkar .  obtaining the sword is quite easy ,  but the amulet and the chalice are in munkar's possession .  fortunately ,  the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county's most skilled warriors fight each other until death .  the winner is then to take the king's place .  of course ,  the king doesn't want anybody to take his place ,  an therefore he has planned to kill the winner  ( instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place )  .  deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation ,  but also to save the old ,  good king's gorgeous daughter  ( barbi benton )  from the claws of evil munkar .  luckily ,  he doesn't get bored on his way to the tournament ,  since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior kaira  ( lana clarkson )  in the meantime .  .  .   the film has many great ,  incredibly stupid and funny scenes .  some of my favorite scenes include :    - deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword .  the head that falls down ,  however ,  is not that guy's head .  the falling head has a red goatee ,  while the guy beheaded by deathstalker had dark hair and no beard .   - when the character of female warrior kaira  ( lana clarkson )  is introduced ,  she is first seen in a black robe ,  hiding her face and body .  deathstalker's traveling companion oghris  ( richard brooker )  fights her ,  and during the sword fight her robe  ( under which she is ,  of course topless )  opens ,  exposing her breasts .  her breasts are the first thing we see of lana clarkson ,  even before her face .   - the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the tournament ,  is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig .   - evil munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest .  he feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers .    .  .  .  there are many other unintentionally funny ,  hilarious ,  and great scenes .  the acting is terrible but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eye-candy ,  and although i described this movie as 'unintentionally funny' ,  i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is .  there is a fair amount of gore ,  and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained .   " deathstalker "  is an incredibly awful movie ,  but i still highly recommend it .  people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives ! 
a noble effort ,  i guess ,  but ultimately a poor one .  before seeing this film ,  i felt  " bartleby ,  the scrivener "  was unfilmable .  after seeing it ,  i still do .  unfortunately ,  i think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on ,  and they will be upset at the film's needless revisions  ( updating from 1850 to 1970 ,  moving from new york to london )  .  even the superb talents of paul scofield can't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film melville's metaphysical classic . 
i married a japanese woman 14 years ago .  we're still together .   however in the 1950's it would never have been as easy .   life in the military had been mined for action ,  drama ,  and comedy for years by this point .  mined to death .  the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover .  this is old hat today ,  but then .  .  .  ?  marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort .  this touched on both possibilities along with the third .  maybe it is love ?    brando did his usual good job .  garner did a better job than he usually does .  he's good ,  but this showed how good he could be .  umecki-chan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue ,  she didn't really stretch .  it was a role that no one who hadn't been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker .   the real scene stealer was red buttons .  red was the best thing in this film .  bank on it .  and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well .   a classic . 
a remarkable example of cinematic alchemy at work ,  with a trite'n'turgid lump of lead script  ( penned by numbingly mediocre hollywood hack nonpareil jole schumacher ,  no less )  being magically converted into a choice chunk of exquisitely gleaming 24-carat musical drama gold thanks to brisk direction ,  fresh ,  engaging performances ,  spot-on production values ,  a flavorsome recreation of 50's era new york ,  an infectiously effervescent roll-with-the-punches tone ,  and a truly wondrous rhythm and blues score by the great curtis mayfield .   the story ,  loosely based on the real life exploits of the supremes ,  prosaically documents the arduous rags-to-riches climb of three bright-eyed ,  impoverished black teenage girl singers who desperately yearn to escape their ratty ,  unrewarding ghetto plight and make it big in the razzle-dazzle world of commercial r&b music .  all the obvious pratfalls of instant wealth and success -- egos run destructively amok ,  drugs ,  corruption ,  fighting to retain your integrity ,  and so on -- are predictably paraded forth ,  but luckily the uniformly excellent work evident in the film's other departments almost completely cancels out schumacher's flat ,  uninspired plotting .  the first-rate acting helps out a lot .  irene cara ,  lonette mckee ,  and dwan smith are sensationally sexy ,  vibrant and appealing leads -- and great singers to boot .  comparably fine performances are also turned in by a charmingly boyish pre- " miami vice "  philip michael thomas as the group's patient ,  gentlemanly manager ,  dorian harewood as mckee's venal ,  aggressively amorous hound dog boyfriend ,  and perennial blaxploitation baddie tony  (  " hell up in harlem ,  "   " bucktown "  )  king as a dangerously seductive ,  smooth operating ,  stone cold nasty gangster .  the tone dips and dovetails from funny and poignant to melancholy and blithesome without ever skipping a beat ,  deftly evolving into a glowing ,  uplifting ode to the human spirit's extraordinary ability to effectively surmount extremely difficult and intimidating odds .   veteran editor sam o'stern acquits himself superbly in his directorial debut .  bruce surtees' luminescent cinematography and gordon scott's expert editing are both flawless .  o'stern's firm grasp of period atmosphere ,  keen eye for tiny ,  but telling little details ,  and unerring sense of busy ,  unbroken pace are just as impressive .  no fooling about curtis mayfield's impeccable soundtrack contributions ,  either .   " jump ,  "   " what can i do with this feeling ,  "   " givin' up ,  "   " take my hand precious lord ,  "   " lovin' you baby ,  "  and  " look into your heart "  are all terrifically tuneful ,  soulful ,  almost unbelievably fantastic songs ,  with the sweetly sultry love jones number  " something he can feel ,  "  which was later covered by both aretha franklin and en vogue ,  clearly copping top musical honors as the best-ever song in the entire movie .  the net result of all these above cited outstanding attributes persuasively illustrates that sometimes it's not the screenplay so much as what's done with said script which in turn determines a film's overall sterling quality . 
i don't think i've ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap .  nothing in it makes any sense .  none of it is clever or well thought out .  out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop-out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothing's there .  thats ok to do once ,  maybe ,  but i counted three times .  there are things thrown in for no apparent reason ,  characters ,  half-formed story lines .  .  .  .  the characters weren't well developed at all .  the ending was .  .  bad .  bad ,  bad ,  bad ,  everything ,  every component ,  of this film is terrible .  and i'm just here to warn you all of that . 
spoilers   well ,  the one line summary says it all .  melville´s  " le samurai "  is the original and there are elements of  " leon "  .  and they are better - much better !   in the  " samurai "  alain delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs  ( with so much suspense in these scenes !  )  .  even the end is exactly the same :  the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand .  the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it .   delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog .  but i guess jarmusch liked  " leon "  very much or even  " desperado "  by rodriguez .  so he added this ,  too .  and let me guess :  the girl will become a professional like ghost dog  ( like natalie portman in  " leon "  )  ?   so what was jarmusch thinking after all ?  where is the unique ,  the original thought in this movie ?   i can´t see the point in making carbon  ( celluloid )  copies .   a 4/10 rating by macaulay connor
running man isn't a great movie ,  in fact it's kinda silly .  but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment .  i don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture ,  it's so silly and over the top ,  that it almost makes fun of itself .  by the way ,  this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there . 
shiri appleby is the cutest little embodiment of evil turned good girl demon-kicking buffy clone ,  elle .  but i'm getting ahead of myself ,  you see lilith was the first woman made by god as a companion to adam .  but she got all uppity evil feminist so god banished her from eden .  a clandestine order known as the fath captures her but doesn't kill her ,  so now with amnesia  ( which is not really explained that well )  lilith  ( now elle )  is free to become the aforementioned buffy-clone who has to battle with a mad scientist who got an injection of lilith's blood .    if the previous paragraph sounded hideously convoluted ,  that's because it is .  the movie is also dull ,  generic ,  and for a film with a plot steeped in theology it doesn't seem to know a lick about it .  this bargain basement lousy-cgied movie was apparently a failed series pilot .  all i can say to the fact that it didn't get picked up is a resounding amen .   my grade :  d-  dvd extras :  commentary by writer/director bill platt and co-writer chris regina ;  and stills gallery ;  video effects samples :  before & after  ( it also has an  " also available "  selection that you would think would lead you to some trailers ,  but nope on dvd covers for other films ,  which is a stupid idea )   dvd-rom extras :  final shooting script and deleted scenes transcript both in pdf format
saw this in the theater in '86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once .   " beirut "  .  .  .  " what do you know about beirut ?  "  .  .  .  " beirut .  .  . he's the best damn baseball that ever lived .  "   you know how it's going to end but it has a great time getting there .  the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the falcons v .  vikings monday night football game while attempting a make-up dinner with their wives .   williams and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's too bad that it's overlooked as a top notch comedy . 
i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years .  it really is a fun little film ,  with a bunch of faces you didn't know were in it .  arkin shines as always .  check it out ;  you won't be dissappointed .  by the way ,  it was just released on dvd and contrary to its packaging ,  it is widescreen .  the transfer is rather poor ,  but at least the whole movie is visible .   ; - ) 
like many americans ,  i was first introduced to the works of hayao miyazaki when i saw  " spirited away .  "  i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times .  now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki .  one of his earlier works is  " castle in the sky .  "  although it's still enjoyable ,  it's not as good as  " spirited away "   ( though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair )  .   a young boy named pazu  ( james van der beek )  is working in a mine late one night ,  when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky .  when she wakes up the next morning ,  she introduces herself as sheeta  ( anna paquin )  .  but sheeta has a secret ,  and before he knows it ,  pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates ,  the army and a lost floating city .   going into a film by hayao miyazaki means you can expect one thing :  a sense of wonder and magic .  many filmmakers have tried ,  but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki .  watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood .   because the film is animated ,  dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words .  it also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors .  the voice acting is varied .  james van der beek fares best .  he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of pazu that is perfect for the character .  anna paquin is nearly as good as sheeta .  she's frightened by the events going on around her ,  but she knows what she has to do .  mark hamill is unrecognizable as the evil muska .  he's dangerous and wants something from sheeta ,  and will do anything to get it .  the other voices are bad .  cloris leachman is awful as dola .  leachman may have won an oscar for  " the last picture show ,  "  but she's annoying as the pirate leader .  leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous .  it's so bad it nearly ruins the film !  jim cummings is an effective voice-over actor ,  but he's miscast as the general .   i would definitely recommend seeing  " castle in the sky .  "  i'll probably end up buying it myself .  but even though it's not as good as  " spirited away ,  "  it's still pretty good . 
absolutely dreadful mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar allan poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works ,  etc .  .  .  when our hero ,  gaston ,  is given the grand show by dr .  maillard ,  head of the asylum ,  we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific ,  such as men hanging around long in a dungeon ,  and comedic ,  such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building .  then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both :  a human man dressed as a chicken ,  yes ,  that's right a chicken ,  that pecks around the ground for chicken feed .  the scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film ,  but ,  at least for me ,  it was the film's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining .  ah !  that is indeed the real horror that is dr .  tarr and his legion of name changes .  and that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem .  yes ,  this is obvious ,  but some have distribution problems and others ,  of which this is one ,  have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once .  this is definitely garbage .  it has very little going for it .  the only performer worth having a look at is claudio brook as the head of the asylum .  he is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally ,  bellows orders ,  sashays with sword in hand ,  and praises the chicken .  i got so tired of hearing him talk about the  " soothing system "  as his means to cure the mentally sick .  what a bunch of ludicrosity ( hey ,  a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word )  .  it won't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting .  cinematic chicken scratch ! 
rajinikanth becomes born again after getting a magical power which he can use seven times .   there are several problems with this movie that are obvious to the casual audience :  the 50ish rajinikanth is still at home with his parents ;  the father of the girl next door thinks that he is a compelling  " boy "   ( 'vaseekaramaana paiyan' )  ;  rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the movie with his sermons ,  the worst being how women of yesteryears got their exercise through household work--yet we are to believe that he is not a theist ;  even though he was well read ,  he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid kite ;  i can go on ,  but you get the picture .   there are god-men ,  there are gods ,  and there is rajinikanth .  the directory has difficulty fitting rajinikanth into one of these categories .  initially ,  rajinikanth is just rajinikanth doing what tamil heroes do--stand up to villains and ,  in spite of being the oldest ,  getting courted by the prettiest girl in the movie .  rajinikanth does this well and some of rajinikanth's trademark styles are actually enjoyable-- " baba count "  is a novelty .  what makes this movie unbearable is that those few initial minutes are just a preface to an worst book to be ever written .  even that preface is punctuated with some comedy which are forced and obvious .   the director doesn't explain the purpose of the hero ;  we see that the hero is facing several hurdles  ( from politicians ,  as usual )  but we can't really root for the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is .  at the end ,  when everyone wants him to be the leader ,  the hero gives another one of his sermons and walks away to become a hermit .  the director offers no solution to the problem in the climax scene .   a .  r .  rehman's score is really interesting .  either he shows patches of brilliance or he didn't bother to invest himself fully into this movie--who can blame him .  there is one scene where rajinikanth steps into the van of one of the crooks and then throws the knife and starts his baba count .  the music is very apt for the moment and acts as a catalyst adding further tension .  the songs are all mediocre ,  no one would bother with the songs from this movie after a few years .   unfortunately ,  1 is the lowest rank you can assign in imdb .  this movie has all the elements that justify its rightful place at the nether of imdb's ranking . 
this movie barely followed the story line of the movie .  all of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie .  they ended up turning it into a cheesy  " tween "  disney movie  " crush "  story between meg and calvin .  it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part ,  or one of the likes .  this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book .  i can't believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap ,  basic rendition .  if you've ever read the book ,  i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of  " lord of the rings "  equivalence .  this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time .  poorly done . 
this is a great film .  from reading other reviews ,  i can see that i'm not the only one who shed a tear .  tamilyn tomita acted with such skill and conviction ,  she made the ending heartfelt and memorable .  in the hands of a lesser actress ,  her last scene would have seemed trite and corny .  one would never guess this film was done on a tight ,  limited budget .  the cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors .  the script is so wonderful ,  i can see why they all wanted to be in it .  if you watch the long ,  long list of credits at the end ,  you'll see that half of hawaii pitched in to make this film happen ,  and for good reason .  the soundtrack  ( available on cd )  is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film .  my only  " complaint "  is that i almost didn't want the film to end . 
i found this movie to be very good in all areas .  the acting was brilliant from all characters ,  especially ms . stone and morissey .  tramell's character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute .  the plot is interesting even though ,  this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels .  the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious , thriller like masterpiece .  go see this film now  ,  it deserves better than what it got from the audience  , which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie ( before it even started )  .  .  .  .  . you won't regret it , if you go see it .  .  . 
tintin and i recently aired as an episode of pbs's p . o . v .  series .  it's based on a taped interview of georges remi a . k . a .  herge ,  tintin's creator ,  from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character ,  first in a catholic newspaper ,  then in his own series of comic books .  awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of herge's dreams .  i first encountered tintin in the pages of children's digest at my local elementary school library reading the secrets of the unicorn .  my mom later got a subscription to cd and i read the entire red rackham's treasure every month in 1978 .  i remember seeing some tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason i didn't get any probably because i was 12 and i thought i was outgrowing them .  i do have breaking free ,  a book written and drawn by j .  daniels ,  published in 1989 ,  six years after herge's death .  haven't read it yet .  this film also covers the artist's personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ  ( whom he later married )  .  her name is fanny and she is interviewed here .  if you love tintin and his creator ,  this film is definitely worth a look .  update :  9/4/07-i've now read breaking free .  tintin and the captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti-capitalist views of mr .  daniels with tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for the captain who he's staying with .  the captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly .  they and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident .  the whole thing takes place in england with working-class cockney accents intact .  not the kind of thing herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless .  oh ,  yes ,  dog snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover  ( which has tintin running over the police !  )  and the dedication page . 
okay ,  sorry ,  but i loved this movie .  i just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies ,  because you don't see many like this one anymore !  i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off ,  or a cheesy imitation ,  what is it imitating ?  i've never seen another movie like this one ,  well ,  not horror anyway .   basically its about the popular group in school ,  who like to make everyones lives living hell ,  so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty .  it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks .   so ,  its like 10 years later ,  and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters .  but .  .  . they are the only ones receiving them !  so they return back to the old school ,  and one by one get knocked off by .  .  .  .  .  .  . yeah you probably know what happens !   the only part that disappointed me was the very end .  it could have been left off ,  or thought out better .   i think you should give it a try ,  and try not to be to critical !   ~*~cupidgrl~*~
first off i'd like to point out that sam niel is nowhere to be seen in this film .  what's a movie without sam niel .  did anyone see event horizon .  d-wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly isn't .  nope ,  no sam niel ,  no good movie .  i recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent d-wars and adding 10 to that five and buying a sam niel film- apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of sam niel movies i recommend  -jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red october -event horizon -not jurassic park three  overall d-wars is a pile
i saw  " an american in paris "  on its first release when i was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway .  i went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times i have seen it since ,  both in the cinema and on tv .  it makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century  ( george gershwin )  and features the greatest male  ( gene kelly )  and female  ( leslie caron )  dancers in hollywood history .  the supporting cast of oscar levant  ( as quirky as ever )  ,  georges guetary  ( why didn't he make more movies  ?  )  and nina foch  ( brilliant in an unsympathetic role )  are at the top of their form .  the closing ballet ,  superbly choreographed to the title music ,  makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists .  all the gershwin songs are beautifully staged ,  but the most memorable are  " it's very clear "   ( caron and kelly on the banks of the seine )  and  " i got rhythm "   ( the kids of paris joining gene kelly in  " une chanson americaine "  )  .  if you love paris ,  see this movie .  if you've never been to paris in your life ,  see it .  but see it  ! 
some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither mark twain nor rodgers and hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either .  you'll look a long time to find a greater rodgers and hart fan than me but burke and van heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great songs - but beautiful ,  moonlight becomes you ,  it's always you ,  the day after forever ,  etc - to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad ,  once and for always ,  plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in if you stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing .  the flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously - why else make merlin a heavy when in most ,  if not all ,  of the other versions he is more a friend/mentor to arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why sir lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie .  on balance it does what it sets out to do ,  entertain ,  so good luck to it . 
i didn't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like  " citizen kane "  and  " seven samaurai .  "  however ,  this movie is so all-around wonderful ,  it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general imdb voter .  however ,  the imdb voter leans to the geeky ,  and  " paulie "  doesn't qualify for that .   the only acting criticism i might suggest is that hallie kate eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child .  i'm sorry ,  but asking a 6 year-old child to out-do dustin hoffman as the rainman is asking for the impossible in film-making .   moving past that minor complaint ,  the movie has the best of many films :  buddy road-trip ,  con-games ,  hero as friendly party-animal  ( party-bird ?  )  ,  disney-like humor for young and old ,  etc .  what's not to like ?  tony shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans .  that's normal for him ,  it seems .   (  " i'm russian .  .  .  i like long stories .  )  i don't like mangoes ,  but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one .  watch the movie and that will make sense .   buddy hackett and cheech marin make very appropriate appearances in the film .  roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them .  i have always found jay mohr to be a bit slimy ,  and his on-screen role fits that as well .  the only surprise to me was finding that jay was also paulie's voice .  in the end ,  even that works well ;  put parrot and anti-parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own .   if you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either ,   " paulie "  is a perfect candidate .  i will ,  however ,  admit that a happy moment colors my review of  " paulie .  "  i was on a road-trip during a major heat-wave .  the car's air-conditioning died ,  half the restaurants had dead cooling  ( as did our hotel )  and i said ,   " let's watch a movie where there is working air-conditioning .  "  so we did .  so for 100 minutes we were cooled ,  amused ,  and given a heart-warming experience .  when i saw it recently on vcr under less emotional circumstances ,  i realized just how well this movie was made .   it's a sleeper film you won't regret watching . 
i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie .  but i had no idea what i was getting myself into .   i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture .   i finally know what hell is like .  it's this movie .  for eternity .  this movie has no value .  it didn't even really have a plot .  there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens .   instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can .  you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie .   don't even watch it .  not even to see how bad it is .  i beg you .  if you watch it ,  then it means they win . 
i consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever seen .   the acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous .  i get the fact that the main character's wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown ,  but it got so silly and boring ,  after a while i could have cared less about any of the characters .   the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot .  the whole thing with the geiger counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there .   then there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer ,  and the confusing ones where he meets himself .   i should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i didn't recognize any of the actors .  do yourself a favor when this movie comes up ,  read a book !  you'll be better off . 
 " private practice "  is being spun off the fairly successful and well written  " grey's anatomy "  .  the cast is fabulous .  the premise might even work .  but the writing is just terrible .   the pre-pilot disguised as a grey's anatomy episode should have been my first warning .  the plot was just blah .  i thought maybe it was a fluke .  so i set the dvr to tape the pilot and all other episodes .   as i was watching the pilot ,  i just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot .  the pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more .  there's supposed to be excitement ,  flash ,  great writing ,  intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season .  amazingly ,  this show had none of that .   thinking it was a fluke ,  i just watched the second episode hoping for the best .  and although marginally better ,  it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss tv .   i just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch .  not worth the effort imo ,  and i would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season .  pass this one up folks . 
no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer .  after all ,  very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take ,  and that was pretty much sinatra's modus operandi on set .   i feel that as the 1960's wore on ,  the quality of the man's films really started to tank .  the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martin's matt helm series which came out at the same time .  perhaps even a james bond competition ,  but nothing really worked for frank during these years .  his personal life in shambles ,  his music fading out .  .  . sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950's .  the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryan's express in 1965 . 
this is the funniest stand up i have ever seen and i think it is the funniest i will ever see .  if you don't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity ,  then this is just not your cup of tea .  but i honestly don't know anyone who has seen this that hasn't liked it .  it is now 17 years later and my friends and i still quote everything from goonie goo goo to the fart game ,  aunt bunnie to the ice cream man ,  ralph and ed to get out !  !  there are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly haven't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever .  take any of robin williams ,  damon wayans ,  the dice ,  george carlin or even the greats like richard pryor or red foxx and this will surpass it .  i don't know how or where murphy got some of his material but it works .  that is what it comes down to .  it is funny as hell .   could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to eddie doing buckwheat and mr .  rogers and such on snl ?  if you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the f-word for the first time ,  they are in complete shock .   his first time he says the f-word is when he does the skit about mr .  t being a homosexual .    "  hey boy ,  hey boy .  you look mighty cute in them jeans .  now come on over here ,  and f@** me up the ass !  "   the crowd erupts in gales of laughter .  no one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them .  but the results were just awesome .  i have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way i was in this stand-up .  in fact ,  the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing wasn't until 1999 when i saw south park :  bigger longer and uncut  .  that comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular ,  as did delirious .  i don't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh .  it is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video .    "  i took your kids fishing last week .  and i put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes gus .  normal kids don't do shit like that gus .  then they started movin their heads around like this and the m****f***** come up with fish .  then they looked at each other and said goonie goo goo !  i said can you believe this f****n shit ?  !  "   see it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off !   10 out of 10
this movie was physically painful to sit through ,  maybe because  ( like many people my age ,  and younger )  i grew up with dr .  seuss and loved his books - funny ,  clever ,  whimsical and subversive at the same time .   " the cat in the hat "  sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story ,  and mike myer's performance as the cat is mostly bewildering .  why the borscht belt accent ,  the unfunny patter ,  the inappropriate jokes ,  the charmless costume ?  i had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem :  the books are simple .  this movie is overblown and way ,  way too long .   you don't expect every kids' movie to be toy story or the iron giant ,  but this one set a new low .  how could mike myers need the money ? 
i would have liked to write about the story ,  but there wasn't any .  i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but  " hinglish "  is only funny for like 5 minutes ,  after that its overkill .  i would have liked to swoon over the 'keep-u-guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as .  .  .  um mm ,  a yash raj movie  (  ?  )  .  i would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action ,  but i don't like cartoons much .    *sigh*  all in all ,  this movie is perfect for :  1 .  people attempting suicide - i promise it'll push you over the edge 2 .  sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that silas guy in the da-vinci code wore .  3 .  people researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 .  movie piraters :  more power to them .  if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it .  5 . barnacles ,  most types of plankton & green algae - because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers .  afterthought :  the director of the movie ,  obviously ,  is a species of his own .   (  and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind .  . one is enough )   things that could have made this a better movie :  1 .  a story 2 .  a choreographer 3 .  a screenplay writer 4 .  a stunt coordinator 5 .  a story  ( did i already say that ?  )  6 .  a director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged  ( although even one who was challenged could have done a better job )  7 .  anil kapoor=bubonic plague - avoid at all costs 8 .  a statutory warning -  " watching yash raj movies is injurious to your mental health "   ?   things i liked about the movie :  1 .  kareena kapoor - for obvious reasons 2 .  the english sub-titles -  " mera dil kho gaya "  becomes -  " my heart is in a void "   ,   " chaliya chaliya chaliya "  turns into  " im a flirt ,  im a lover ,  im a vagabond "   .  . priceless .   in short ,  tashan to me ,  is like the opposite of a rubrics cube - the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player ,  tashan promises to lower your iq ,  and that .  .  in a mere 2 . 5 hours !  woot !   *sigh* .  . but thats just me .  i could be wrong you've been warned anyways . 
as was to be expected ,  a mazursky film made in the 70s would be counter-culture ,  sympathetic towards the hippies - and have a lot of hippies in it - and ,  naturally ,  it is childishly anti-authoritarian  ( e . g .  the scene on the mexican border ,  when sutherland provokes a custom's officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he  ( sutherland )  has long hair )  .  the constant left-wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it beforehand ;  sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film ,  and most of these ideas are either about blacks or indians  ( needless to say ,  he would be welcomed with open arms in today's hollywood )  .  one of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in beverly hills - a race-war ,  so-to-speak ,  in the middle of l . a .  .  this is the kind of nonsense that mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies .  fortunately ,  some of sutherland's hippie friends make fun of this black-revolution premise ,  and the resulting dialogue isn't bad ;  a little later ,  the jewish guy makes a crack about sutherland making a movie about  " masturbation and the black problem "  ,  when the latter starts talking about masturbation .  another funny moment is when sutherland's older daughter performs some pc crap on stage with her white school-mates ,  and they all say :   " we ,  the black people of the republic of south africa .  .  .  "  .   there is always a certain amount of self-indulgence when hollywood makes a movie about hollywood - especially when it's hollywood making a movie about hollywood discussing hollywood doing movies .  now ,  that's very ,  very self-indulgent ,  indeed .  the scene with fellini  ( playing himself )  is more amusing than annoying ,  though .  mazursky throws in the standard flower-children and anti-vietnam bullshit into the soup ,  and also pokes fun at corporate hollywood ,  but he was/is just as much a part of the  " phony hollywood "   ( lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment )  as anyone else ;  i am pretty sure that he ,  too ,  makes phony small-talk in beverly hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesn't know or like ,  but whose money he wants badly for his next  ( left-wing )  project .  as for his hair :  he has the worst hair i've seen in a very long time  ( on film or elsewhere )  ;  it's sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle-aged accountant would have if he grew it long .  the film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness ,  but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third .  if you'd like to read my parody/biography of donald sutherland  ( and other hollywood actors )  ,  contact me by e-mail . 
this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it .  what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers ,  producers and director ?  how on earth did they get funding for this abomination ?  the plot is laughable ,  the acting is poor at best ,  the story .  .  .  what story ?  the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off .   i guess i'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute .   *** spoler alert ***  i only saw this movie because scott adkins was in it .  .  .  and he is in it .  .  .  for 30 seconds .  .  .   i give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade imdb has to offer .   do yourself a favour :  see an uwe boll movie instead .  .  .  twice .  .  .  it's more worthy of your time . 
the plot doesn't begin to describe the film :  a man is writing a film ,  or rather ,  *this* film .  it's totally self referential to the point that you think it's going to fold in on itself like a black hole .  the writer writes something and it happens ,  or something happens and he writes about it .   it's very philosophical ,  like  " waking life "  but more zen oriented and for that matter ,  much better ,  in my opinion .  at one point there are person-on-the-street interviews and then you see shots of these people being filmed ,  and then you discover that their responses are scripted when one keeps flubbing her lines .  there is beautiful scenery and optical illusions .   i hope it comes out on dvd so i can watch it again more carefully .  seen at cinequest  ( the san jose ,  ca film festival )  on 2/25/2002 . 
this is essentially a variation on house of wax  , in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies  , vincent price . in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other , less talented and less scrupulous people  . in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist  , the great rinaldo  ( john emery ) insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs . price is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi .  he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer .   price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy . the rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease  .   good solid b movie melodrama  ,  this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece  . shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
dear me .  .  .  peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been .  but his choice of films ,  say ,  after 1964 ,  was very unfortunate .  he didn't seem to realize how to use his talents .  he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did .  of his later films ,  only  " the optimists of nine elms "  and  " being there "  have impressed me of those i have seen .   that said ,  the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad - i have yet to see  " carlton browne "  and  " heavens above !  "  - at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree .  but ,   " there's a girl in my soup "  really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers' part in terms of character .  in his films from 1955-64 ,  you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles .  here ,  you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead .  it's almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality .  he certainly does not convince ,  try as he might ,  or create an interesting character .  he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant ,  and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for .   hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry ;  this is no easy ,  genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy .  it is very artificial seeming ,  all the way through - i know that it is part of danvers' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies ,  but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces .  sellers has a very grating way of playing  " charm "  as well .  .  .  this character really has no depth ,  and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest .  sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty ,  iconoclastic performance in  " lolita "  .   there really is nothing to say about the plot ,  direction or characters ,  as frankly they leave little or no impression .  this is truly one of the most anaemic ,  complacent ,  misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen .  a nonentity of a  " vehicle "  for sellers' undisputed talents .   rating : - * 1/2/*****
plotwise this is a rather silly little whodunnit masquerading as a period drama/biopic .   however the only reason i wanted to see it in the first place was because i was curious about what the great henry fonda was really like at his peak .  i wasn't disappointed - he produces a truly warm and charismatic performance .   in addition i can honestly say that i was never really bored at any stage during the film ,  so a strong ***1/2 out of *****
season after season ,  the players or characters in this show appear to be people who you'd absolutely love to hate .  is this show rigged to be that or were they chosen for the same ?  each episode vilifies one single person specifically and he ends up getting killed off .  you enjoy seeing them get screwed although its totally wrong and sick .  you enjoy seeing them screwing others ,  getting screwed themselves ,  playing dirty ,  getting it back ,  escaping and finally getting kicked out by trump .  the amount of tears also seems to be increasing by the season .   the rewards which attempt to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also heavily reduced .  in the newer seasons ,  its like  " you get to meet xyx who'll lecture you about uvw "  .  . like who freaking cares ?  the characters are so hateable ,  collectively and individually ,  that you wonder if they're paid actors ?  the only sane one gets to win .   watch with caution and maintain a conscience .  those are your fellow human beings in the firing line . 
probably the worst film i've ever seen ,  the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep .  the only good actor was colm meaney .  i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end ,  no emotion ,  no charisma .  .  . nothing  ! 
last night i finished re-watching  " jane eyre "   ( 1983 )  ,  the bbc mini-series adapted from charlotte bronte's gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of english literature with timothy dalton  ( my favorite james bond )  as mr .  edward rochester and zelah clarke ,  as jane eyre ,  a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl ,  a governess at mr .  rochester's estate ,  thornfield .   " jane eyre "  has been one of my most beloved books since i was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words ,   " this book is amazing "  and so it was and i have read it dozens of times and i am still not tired of it .  its beautiful language ,  refined ,  fragrant ,  and surprisingly fresh ,  the dialogs ,  and above all ,  two main characters ,  and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers .   " jane eyre "  has been adapted to tv and big screen many times ,  18 according to imdb .  the actors as famous and marvelous as joan fontaine and orson welles ,  william hurt and charlotte gainsbourg ,  george c .  scott and susannah york ,  ciarán hinds and samantha morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society ,  laws ,  religion ,  by the differences in age ,  backgrounds ,  experiences ,  and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years .  of all these films i've only seen one ,  300 minutes long bbc version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where timothy dalton who frequently plays dark ,  brooding characters did not just play edward rochester brilliantly and with class ,  he was mr .  rochester - sardonic ,  vibrant ,  the force of nature ,  powerful ,  passionate ,  sexy ,  and tormented master of thornfield .  zelah clarke was also convincing as sweet ,  gentle ,  intelligent and strong jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning ,  and quiet but firm willpower .   added on september 17 ,  2007 :  during the last two weeks ,  i've seen five  " jane eyre "  movies and it was a wonderful experience .  there is something to admire in every adaptation of  " jane eyre "  even if not all of them are completely successful .  this version is still my favorite  " jane eyre "  film . 
ok ,  so i just saw the movie ,  although it appeared last year .  .  .  i thought that it was generally a decent movie ,  except for the storyline ,  which was stupid and horrible .  .  .  first of all ,  we never get to know anything about the creatures ,  why they appeared ,  wtf are they doing in our world ,  and really ,  have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space ?  secondly ,  the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created .  .  .  really ,  how large could the underground for a sub station could have been ?  there were only so many of those creatures ,  so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain ,  they could have just planted some tactical bombs ,  or maybe clear the are and a nuke would have done the job .  i know it sounds funny and it is ,  but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary .  .  .  thirdly ,  leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting vinnie jones ,  who was way taller and bigger in stature .  then again ,  when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp ,  watching all the abominations .  i mean ok ,  the conductor had creepy help ( lol )  ,  but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way .  .  .  i mean he risks his life first ,  then does nothing exactly when he should have .  he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward .  .  .  this might be the case ,  but not after showing so much braveness earlier on .  .  .  then ,  the cop thing .  .  .  come on !  this was a city having a subway ,  i bet there must have been other cops except that lady ,  other police stations , this was really kind of silly .  .  .  all in all ,  great acting by vinnie jones ,  interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all .  .  .  by the way ,  what did the signs on the chest mean ?  vinnie jones cannot make up for the rest .  .  . 
to me a matter of life and death is just that- simply the best film ever made .   from beginning to end it oozes class .  it is stimulating ,  thought provoking ,  a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples .   the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly .  the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy .   no matter how many times i watch the film - and i have watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me .  it makes me smile ,  it makes me laugh ,  it makes me think ,  it makes me cry .  it is as fresh today as it was in 1946 .   if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film . 
i really hate most end of the world movies .  they show what jaded hollywood people think of the rest of the world ,  and they clearly think we're a bunch of sadistic idiots  ( or at least that watching sadistic idiots react to things is somehow entertaining )  .  i've been to l . a .  many times ,  i have family that works in show business ,  and i just want to say that these are the *last* people we should be looking to for a reality check .  some disaster movies at least paint a clever picture :  children of men ,  12 monkeys ,  but usually the message is just  " people will do anything to survive ,  all is dark and sad and purposeless ,  we should all be ashamed of ourselves "  .   don't get me wrong ,  i like the idea of a story that explores throwing off the system of social order and testing people's mettle in the face of horror ,  and i do believe some people would act like this film portrayed ,  but sadistic idiots aside ,  i seriously doubt society would just dissolve into every man for himself ,  that's just insulting . 
there is an episode of the simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a  " killbot factory "  .  here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke ,  but what patricia foulkrod's documentary does is show us ,  scarily ,  that it is not that far from the truth .  after world war two the us army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war ;  that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of 'me or them' .  since then the training process of the us army has been to remove all moral scruples and turn recruits into killing machines who don't think of combatants as people .  to develop in them a most unnatural state :   " the sustainable urge to kill "  .   first off ,  this isn't an antiwar movie as such .  whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light ,  foulkrod focuses rather on an aspect that doesn't get as much media attention as ,  say ,  the debate over the legality of a war or it's physical successes or failures ;  the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being .  it's the paradox that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally unsuitable to live as part of that society themselves ,  and whilst most of the examples and interviewees are from the current middle east conflict foulkrod makes the links to past conflicts ,  especially vietnam ,  painfully clear .  this isn't about any particular war ,  it's about the problems caused by war in general .   structurally the film seems to be split into three sections ;  how recruits are drawn into the army and the training they receive ,  how they are treated once they are in combat ,  and what happens once they leave the army .  once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the policies that are inherent in the armed forced ,  policies that are put into place to make soldiers into an affective combat force but removing all humanity from the individuals .  those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple ,  how word like  " democracy "  and  " freedom "  are banded around ,  but once the training begins they become  " enemy "  and  " kill "  and  " destroy "  .  how once in action soldiers don't care what they are ordered to do ,  as they are ingrained with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order ,  whatever it may be ,  they are one step closer to going home .  they have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as that's what they've been trained to do .   but the ground truth's main goal is to highlight the way the us army discards those who have fought for their country once they return home .  there is no real rehabilitation given to soldiers returning ,  and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done ,  and most policies in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up .  this is the final indignity ,  that once they are used they are cast away .   if there is a flaw in the film it is that foulkrod doesn't attempt to show another side to the argument .  you would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with post traumatic stress syndrome .  it would have been interesting to see those of a less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and policies .  there is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself known .   but other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary ,  and foulkrod's use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war . 
if you enjoy the original snl cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs .  when this first came out my friends and i waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house .  half way through the movie the theatre was 3/4 empty .  we refused to leave thinking it would get better .  when the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre .  the movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight .  in interviews with  " mr .  mike "  he refused to comment on this film .  the film was an inside joke on the episodes of snl that came out right after the films release and closing in one day .  we all tried to contact  " mr .  mike "  by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored . 
the movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong shannon lee and introduces two very simpathetic side characters through the first half .  but later something happens and all the sudden shannon turns into this straight faced ,  second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it's own context .  the second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clichés ,  bad acting ,  a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination .  not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang .    " game of death 2 "  was bad and clownified bruce ,  but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played bruce lee back then .  i truly believe that she can do much better than this and i hope she participates in a better production next time .   if you are a real hard core action fan and don't care about quality go ahead and see this movie .  i was personally looking forward to it but just got terribly disappointed . 
having looked at some of the other comments here ,  i have a main complaint with this presentation .    the two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful  " victim ,  "  and the handsome ,  obviously extremely  " off-center ,  "  blue-collar protagonist  ( if just short of  " totally-deranged "  )  - take turns beating the hell out of each other ,  sort of like a caucasian kabuki scenario .   this is all right ,  and this is ,  of course ,  mainly a  " turning-the-tables "  story .  however ,  my referenced complaint is that i believe the director got caught-up in his desire to display farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes .  beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe ,  and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes ,  these distract from the poignancy level of the drama .   her roommates i'm certain give performances as written and directed - however ,  their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing ,  don't ring true -- based upon farrah's previous experience with this guy ,  the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions ,  and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred .   but this is a film and story ,  compelling as much in spite of ,  as because of ,  the director's work . 
i love watching jerry as much as the rest of the world ,  but this poor excuse for a soft-core porno flick is needlessly offensive ,  lacks anything resembling wit ,  and serves merely as a vehicle of self-promotion for springer .  even though it runs a quick 90 minutes ,  the film drags hideously ,  and i should have had the common sense to walk out .  simply atrocious . 
it's only 2 episodes into a 5 part drama ,  but i can already state that this is one of the best things i've ever seen .  that's on tv ,  silver screen or even in real life .   as a writer ,  it's so good it's almost demoralising !  as a viewer it's so entertaining that i'm annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday .  it's clear that all these negatives are actually positives .   i'm a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas .  in comparison to movies ,  tv dramas always seemed to be dated ,  quite tame ,  and well ,  generally boring !   " five days "  has really brought tv drama into the 21st century ,  so for me at least ,  it's mind changing .  go watch it . 
this movie is about sexual obsession .  bette davis plays mildred .  this is a woman who men are drawn to .  not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity .  now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious .  there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her .  she works as a waitress in a coffee shop ,  she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt .  it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her .  one day phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her .  he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment .  meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it .  he dreams about her like she is a angel ,  but she is no angel .  he is constantly thinking about her .  his med school grades are even failing .  so what the nookie is too good .  he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy .  she always lets phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time .  he is heart broken but he meets another woman .  they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo .  mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed .  phillip takes her in again ,  but she starts going out with a friend of his ,  the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out .  she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him ,  well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up .  oh we have a club foot that he has problems about ,  even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it .  he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred .  well he has no school tuition ,  can't find a job .  finally sally and her dad takes him in .  not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill .  soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor .  meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again .  she has tb .  meanwhile he is still leading sally down the primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship .  finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally .  i wished she told him to stuff it .  now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points .  but i feel phillip was the bad guy .  yes mildred is a strumpet but he knows it ,  and he keeps coming back .  mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers .  i guess the sex wasn't as good .  but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred .  not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he intends to do about baby  (  apparently the baby's name )  he laughs is off ,  he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy .  sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist .  philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either .  men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed .  yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain .  to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred . 
someone needed to make a car payment .  .  .  this is truly awful .  .  .  makes jean claude's cyborg look like gone with the wind .  .  .  this is an hour i wish i could sue to get back .  .  .  luckily it produced severe somnolence .  .  .  from which i fell asleep .  how can actors of this caliber create this dog ?  i would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre .  i now use the dvd as a coaster on my coffee table .  $5 . 99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie .  .  .  if you really have to have it ,  wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they would not sell .   please for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity . 
this could be looked at in many different ways .  this movie sucks ,  its good or its just plain weird .  the third one probably explains this movie best .  it has strange themes and just has a strange plot .  so who else but christopher walken would play in this no matter how bad ,  average or even how good it might be .   the acting was what you would expect especially out of ben stiller .  jack black i have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad .  christopher walken is always off the wall .  he is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is .  comedy wise it is somewhat funny .  this of course meaning that it does have its moments  ( though very few )  but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way .   the directing was average as well .  barry levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here .  this movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it .  just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film .   the writing is the key to a good comedy .  obviously that means the writing here failed .  at best it is below average .  considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible .  that is never a good thing to say about a movie though .    if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating .  he is always quite a character in his movies .  stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere .  not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie . 
if you can make it thru  " classic meyer "  titles/intro ,  you can wade thru anything .  but would you want to ?  i did not find a lot there to dig my teeth into .  i suppose if you go into it with low enuff expectations you will be delighted  ( a la charlie's angels .  )  but for my money i'd like a little something more ,  more visual ,  more moving .  more .  i feel like i'm begging for gruel @ the foot of the master  .  the mans got the goods  .  but he just won't share . 
et's obsession with dannielynn smith is despicable .  leave the child alone .  with all the constant attention she'll most likely grow up psychotic ,  depressed or worse .  think of princess diana and how she longed for privacy .  now poor little rich girl ashley olson just wants to be left alone .  no wonder greta garbo became a recluse and said  " i want to be alone "  .  how much does et make off this little girl ?  does et not have anything better to report on ?  i bet there's lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were .  by the way ,  i never heard that anna nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance .  who is paying for the lifestyle of larry ,  howard and little dannielynn ?  could it be et ? 
i am a kind person ,  so i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 .  it was without a doubt the worst movie that i've seen in a long time .  there was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i . e .  what jesus may really have wanted us to know ,  were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine  ( arquette )  .  total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience .  the acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired .  and ,  if i saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera ,  i may have started screaming louder than patricia . 
although a tear jerker it is definitely a  " feel good "  movie .  all the actors were excellent and will smith as always ,  does the job and does it well .  i could go on but pick any ten of the  " 10 "  ratings and they've said it as well and likely better than i could .    but ,  since i must include at least 10 lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer .  her performance was most enjoyable and i look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come .   and ,  this film demonstrates that will smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor . 
i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures .  purple rain not only broke boundaries ,  it set a decade ,  the costumes ,  the music ,  the behavior ,  and the dancing !  to this day ,  my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution .   now the movie itself ,  i just meant what i said in the title ,  because for the most part ,  this movie itself is made by the music .  the acting ?  please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures ,  because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means .  but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome ,  their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious .  i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie .   prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music .  while the movie and acting is pretty bad ,  this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too .  this movie defined the 80's ,  so just have fun with it .  prince would want it that way ,  just to party on down !  oh ,  boy ,  that sounded lame .   9/10
director vincenzo natali's cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which ,  although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration ,  manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience .   morgan sullivan  ( jeremy northam )  ,  a stay-at-home husband with an overbearing wife ,  decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high-tech company digi corp .  his job is to travel to conferences across the country  ( under the assumed identity of jack thursby )  and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses ,  via a nifty little electronic pen-gizmo .   in reality ,  however ,  the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities .  morgan ,  along with his fellow conference attendees ,  is being brainwashed .  the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma ,  during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities .  once they are totally convinced that they are someone else ,  they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies ,  where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion .   but digi corp's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative-for-hire rita foster  ( lucy liu )  ,  who opens morgan's eyes to what is really happening .  she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques .  she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby ,  then he will be 'eliminated' .  morgan plays along ,  and applies for a job at rival business sunways .   however ,  arriving at his new workplace ,  he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy .  fortunately ,  the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent .   from hereon in ,  things get progressively more complicated ;  the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone .  in an exciting finale ,  all eventually becomes clear  ( but only if you've been following events very carefully )  .   director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget .  he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast ;  jeremy northam , in particular ,  is fantastichis portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection .   cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects ,  high rise and necropolis . 
these type of movies about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and daring a couple of years ago but more and more movies like this got made over the past few years ,  making it hard for the movies to still stand out really .   also this movie received little publicity ,  aside from the usual little film festivals that featured this little french movie ,  as well as the big festivals that are always fond of these type of little movies about everyday subjects that aren't being handled too often in movies .  the film premiered at cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well .   the movie doesn't really stand out from others ,  since it actually features little new once you've already seen some similar movies such as this one but this however really doesn't mean that  " naissance des pieuvres "  is a bad one to watch .  the movie is certainly a good watch ,  that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively ,  in a typical somewhat slow french cinematic pace .   it's a coming of age movie ,  that focus on the life of mainly 3 totally different mid-teenagers .  sexuality is a big theme within the movie ,  which gets handled delicately and subtle .  it makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one ,  though perhaps a bit predictable ,  since the movie doesn't quite offer anything original enough within its genre .   this type of french movie will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty ,  with deep layers and meanings to it .   " naissance des pieuvres "  however is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be into euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie .  it's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie ,  due to its subject and visual approach .   the movie is also being made realistic by its actors ,  who don't had and have a lot of experience within the movie business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles .  the strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments .   a good movie on its subject .   7/10
let me tell you something about this movie .  i have seen it twice .  the first time i was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me .  i really liked it .  i thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool .   i saw it again a few days ago .  it was horrible .  really .  i don't know why i thought it was funny before but now .  .  .  i didn't laugh at all .  there was nothing even slightly entertaining .  it was just dumb .  the story was weak .  the acting was nothing special .  there are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best .   what is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist .  really .  don't get me wrong ,  usually i don't complain about racism in movies .  however i have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like 'the shaolin temple' or about the fact that the only black man in 'the street fighter' is one of the bad guys or .  .  .  whatever ,  you get the point .  there are people seeing racism everywhere .  i wonder how would they react to a movie like 'the meteor man' .  why ?  i will tell you why .  there are no asians in this movie .  there are no white people among the good guys .  in fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys .  all the good guys are african americans .  don't get me wrong ,  i don't care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green .  .  .  what i do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie .  this is the only movie like that that i have ever seen .  it is just not realistic .  if there is only one black man in a japanese movie which is the case with 'the street fighter' there is no problem - in japan most of the people are asians .  but if there is only one white man in an american movie there is some sort of problem - in usa most of the people are white .  it is like filming a japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one asian as a bad guy .  just not real .   that is it .  i am giving the movie the rate of 4/10 .  it would be 1/10 if i hadn't have fun with it as a kid . 
this movie is a classic in every sense of the word .  it is very entertaining and also very disturbing .  the acting in this movie is well done .  the story itself is believable ,  suspenseful ,  and well thought out .  character development is also done well ,  the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film .  the villains in this movie are very threatening ,  from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something .  this movie shows how a human being ,  when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods ,  facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it .  not everyone is going to like this film ,  there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable .  it is definitely worth watching .  this movie is a masterpiece . 
a cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films .  the trail leads the mother all over europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep .   this is one of the countless soft-core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill . personally i'd rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing .  this is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not .  mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead . periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of s&m to the proceedings .  the violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement ,  its all so incredibly fake .  worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting .   ( basically par for the course for many of these films )   you'll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that i stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur ,  but there was nothing .  the most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a buick .  i watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery ,  not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller .   avoid . 
this is superb - the acting wonderful ,  sets ,  clothes ,  music - but most of all the story itself .   i am amazed there aren't more reviews of this movie - certainly one of the best of the 1980s .   it's also a wonderful movie to see in tandem with the great  " random harvest "  which has much the same opening crisis   -- a middle aged ,  unknown english w . w . i officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war ,  suffering from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of his name ,  origin ,  or anywhere he belongs - he proves to be a very wealthy established man - when he  " recovers "  ,  he will not remember the years before the war --   but there the movies' resemblances end .   my warmest thanks to all who participated in the movie - particularly the actors ian holm ,  alan bates ,  ann margret  ( what a great and surprising casting choice )  ,  glenda jackson ,  julie christie .   this one stays with you forever . 
as someone else mentioned ,  it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat .  then the main story :  a photographer  ( gaffari )  and a writer  ( shepard )  meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains .  first they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at ,  with increasing irritation to the audience ,  by gaffari .  once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers  ( hansel and gretel ,  anyone ?  )  what happens next i will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because i most assuredly couldn't .  now ,  i like eurohorror ,  and this woulda been better if only artigot  ( writer and director )  had made some attempt at logical story telling .  the backdrop  ( pyrenees ?  )  makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences .  the verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them .  the photography is nice .  just wish the whole thing made sense .  you can view this film at archive . org . 
the most satisfying element about  " dan in real life "  is that the relationship between dan  ( steve carell )  and marie  ( juliette binoche )  makes sense and is beautifully realistic .  the casting of oscar-winner juliette binoche as dan's love interest was a superb decision ;  she is exceptionally talented ,  intelligent ,  naturally attractive and ,  thank goodness ,  appropriately aged for the part !  had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson ,  it would have been a disaster .   another wonderful aspect about  " dan in real life "  is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the  " frat pack "  formula :  dumb chicks ,  chauvinistic guys ,  and sleazy jokes .   " dan in real life "  is witty and has fun ,  intelligent laughs throughout .  whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing ,  the jokes from  " dan in real life "  are more natural and clever ,  and involve some thinking on the part of the audience .   my only problem with  " dan in real life "  is that the rebellious ,  middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson .  it's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director .  either way ,  her character is unrealistic and annoying .  but ,  this is only a minor flaw in the film ,  and does not take away from the story as a whole .   all in all ,   " dan in real life "  is a great film ,  a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies .  the quality of the writing ,  directing ,  acting ,  and  ( especially )  cinematography is excellent .  it is simply a beautiful ,  light-hearted comedy . 
i love buying those cheap ,  lousy dvd's from alpha video .  one day ,  i happened to buy this one .  it's the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50's ,  all sexed up .  replete with unscientific everything ,  scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama ,  it's an enjoyable film ,  to those who appreciate this kind of stuff .  and if you can 'suspend your disbelief' enough ,  you can actually get creeped out-- not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet ,  but toward the end ,  with the character of 'the perfect body' .  it's so  .   .   .   .  what's another word for mindf***ing ? 
i loved this movie .  you have to respect midgets that dressed up like tiny martians .  sure the story may have been thin at times ,  but you can't take away from the way it was done .  i used to watch this over and over again when i was 8 .  its a kids movie ,  and besides ,  it has some of the greatest quotes ever .  blanzee's  " home on the range "  rendition is awesome .    very well done if you ask me ,  8 of 10 . 
so .  .  . we get so see added footage of brando .  .  . interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff .  susannah york was hardly a slouch .  new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets .  real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that .  .  . let's listen to donner make fun of lester's version that made more logical sense .  the president talks of the zod  " defacing "  the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore .  tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd .  superman's  " freedom of the press "  line sounded silly compared to  "  .  . care to step outside "  which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark's earlier scene in the truck stop .  then there is the ending with the  " turn back the world to go back in time "  effect .  it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack ,  n . j .  ever went since it doesn't free zod and company any more . 
one of the first of the best musicals ,  anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences ,  such as kelly dancing with jerry the mouse ,  kelly dancing with 7-year-old sharon mcmanus ,  sinatra singing with jose iturbi playing piano ,  kathryn grayson singing with iturbi conducting ,  and much more .  the technicolor is perfect ,  with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath ,  through transparent keys ,  and grayson singing ,  seen through the finder of another camera .  the plot is thin ,  but you get involved from kelly's & sinatra's enthusiasm .  sailor's on leave ,  they have to take home a runaway boy  ( dean stockwell )  and sinatra falls for his aunt .  to set him up with the aunt  ( grayson )  ,  kelly suggests that sinatra can get her an audition with jose iturbi .  but sinatra's young and naive in this one ,  and in his own sung words falls in love too fast .  while they're trying to contact iturbi ,  who's never available ,  he starts to fall for another girl  ( barbara britton )  ;  but kelly's now falling love with grayson .  anchors aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live-action / cartoon sequence with tom and jerry ,  but there's a lot more here that's worth a look .  i'm giving it nine stars because ,  while it's not quite as good as the best musicals - singin' in the rain ,  the music man ,  oklahoma - it is one of the first of their class of technicolor big productions  ( perhaps meet me in st .  louis was the first )  ,  and better than most others . 
this movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy .  he examines the ever illusive question of 'who am i' and 'what is i ? ' it's a courageous and thought provoking enterprise .  there is a shipload of beautiful images ,  dream-inspired ,  escher-like paradoxes reminiscent of the hand drawing itself ,  or rather ,  erasing itself .  more and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film ,  we see him phoning with his wife who left for peru ,  leaving him to take care of their baby ,  a task he performs with less and less attention until he's so absorbed in his dilemma's that he hardly looks at the child anymore .  his wife comes back and makes a scene ,  destroys his notes and helping him go over the last treshold until he erases him-self .  interspersed with eye-pleasing and i-destructing images ,  the story is mainly philosophical .  it's about the veils of maya ,  the world of illusion .  the paradox of the movie however ,  is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop .  during the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophising the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie .  if that was the purpose of the maker ,  he succeeded quite well . 
considering its pedigree ,  this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is .  even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together lemmon ,  lanchester ,  kovacs and gingold ?  - the entire event is dully paced ,  drearily shot and ,  more often than not ,  witless .   kim novak's gifts were not essentially comic ,  as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid .  james stewart was a fine comedian ,  as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from the philadelphia story to harvey .  i think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does .  except maybe the cat . 
sadly , this is not 'the best british gore film since hellraiser' ,  though the dvd cover claims this ,  which is what tricked me into buying it .  it is ,  however ,  an homage to many of the great horrors of old ,  films from most notably the amicus stable .   cradle .  .  .  is shot on mini dv ,  which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie ,  can be done so much better .  every scene ,  set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way  ( standard key ,  fill ,  rear setup )  ,  which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece .  the gore content is ,  quite frankly ,  laughable .  from the opening shots where we see a man's obviously foam rubber head torn apart ,  through to tacky cheap prop hammers ,  the creature effects and the terrible cg ,  there was nothing in there that impressed me at all .   the acting is abominable ,  from the near-comatose detective to the brummie dwarf ,  via dani filth ,  the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed .  each of the substories is more formulaic than the last ,  and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs .  look out for the 'mental asylum' - a georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside ,  and the most bizarre  ( and not in a good way )  padded cell i have seen .   it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering  ( nay ,  running )  away at any available opportunity .  i actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running .   it does ,  however ,  mark one of the last known appearances of emily booth's breasts ,  which i guess is one  ( um ,  two )  things it has going for it .  once that's out of the way though ,  it is all downhill .   i've heard people say good things about alex chandon ,  and i would love to believe them ,  but on this evidence i'm not likely to .  if you want a decent homage to amicus ,  avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead .   currently battling it out with blair witch 2 :  book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen . 
i'm not a writer or an critic .  .  . i'm just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago .  .  .  . and i want to thank people that worked on creating this movie ! it is not the best or the most .  .  .  .  but it touched my heart .  .  . why ?  ?  ? i would like to understand it myself .  .  . it is easy and accessible .  . it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it ! it is about love and caring ,  about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff  .  .  .  .  .  .  . look at all the time that we have but we miss it .  .  .  . why a fu*k do we do that ?  ?  ? we need to live like were dying  .  .  . care about every second and remember : if we do good things-good things come back to us ! happiness is real .  .  . and it has a special taste in new york .  .  . i love this town and the world the we live in !  !  !  ! thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes ( english is my second language )  .  .  . 
the lead characters in this movie fall into two categories :  smart and stupid .  simple enough .   jiri machacek  ( standa )  plays a hapless ,  dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit .  when he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil ,  former boss ,  the situation gets out of control .   while standa is genuinely  ( but endearingly )  stupid ,  his buddy ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time .  without ondrej ,  standa might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success .  with ondrej ,  life will never be boring ,  but it sure won't be without a lot of headaches !   ivan trojan plays zdenek ,  an evil genius type who degenerates into some hitler-esquire delusional tyrant .  zdenek and his henchmen try to kill standa to keep zdenek's secrets safe .   i am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of czech films .  for a relatively small country ,  the czech republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment .  the best czech movies i have seen are :  1 )  peliky and 2 )  tmavomodrý svet  ( dark blue world )  .  if you see these two movies ,  you have seen the absolute best of czech cinema . 
i was excited to hear that cesar montano had decided to make a movie in the cebuano language .   ( not 'dialect' as most filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as .  as cebuano and tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as french and spanish are to each other .  )  but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie .  being a canadian ,  of cebuano parents ,  i was optimistic about the revival of the visayan film industry when i heard about this film .  i was further excited to hear that it wasn't another stupid action movie or melodrama as filipinos love these types of movies .  but alas ,  i was short-changed .   panaghoy serves as an ego trip for cesar montano .  montano of course plays the hero of the movie .  and when i say 'hero' i mean in the most stereotypical of manners ;  his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bol-anons to victory against the japanese .  his character has no depth or complexity .  he just fits the hero mold .  the rest of the characters are one dimensional ;  they all fit their cookie cutter roles .   i'm all for slow-moving/meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving .  it didn't really meditate on anything .  just because a movie is historically-themed ,  a drama and slow-moving doesn't make it a well-made film .   particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony .  his performance was embarrassing .   if montano wanted to revive the visayan film industry he should have really thought this through .  he said he wanted to make visayan movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc .  but really ,  this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals .  to get visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences ,  even if it meant sacrificing quality .  obviously he didn't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audience-attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door .   i'm afraid now that visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie .  if ever i said to a filipino that i want to see more visayan movies of course i'd get an answer like ,   " visayans don't make good movies .  didn't you see panaghoy sa suba ?  "  of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see .   an example of movies that are meditative ,  not just slow moving ,  are the tagalog film blackout or david lynch's the straight story .  i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non-tagalog filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie .  these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called 'pure cinema' .  images without words are used to convey the story .  but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie .  and they do it very well .  panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood .   and what's with so many filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother ?  ?  ? 
make no mistake ,  maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever ,  and there will never be one more gorgeous .  she is visually stunning .  that aside ,  it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film .  this is a great film .  it not only has the classic tarzan aura ,  but also the feel of the continuing saga .  we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory ,  one of them in love with jane ,  the other ,  a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history . and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic .  there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted .  however ,  the africans are depicted as individuals ,  and at the end ,  two even become more heroic than the white hunters ,  and stand out as such .  in fact ,  the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters .  the finale ,  also ,  is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie .  the great lion attack has never been duplicated ,  and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction .  if i left anything out ,  it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it .  but it is everything you could want in a movie . 
i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall ,  but four things really stand out :  sam raimi's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy (  ?  ) man ,  alan arkin's wonderful characterisation of the camp owner ,  and best of all ,  the cinematography .  the beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories .   the dialog and mood feel very natural and believable .  some reviewers criticise the lack of a more  " profound "  script .  to me ,  it is exactly that lack that makes this film work .  the characters and their problems seem real and because of that ,  i care about what happens to them .   the bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right . 
after tracking it down for half a year ,  i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing .   not disappointing because i'm one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro .  but i couldn't believe goro was forced to make a movie as such .  in his respectable self now ,  i'm sure he cringes that he made this movie .  nevertheless ,  they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed ,  ill at ease and half depressed most of the time .   man ,  i still can't believe he made this movie .  .  . i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie .  .  .  . hahahaha .  .  .  .   but i'm glad to have watched it .  thank goodness he has grown up .  .  .  . 
hello playmates . i recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur askey ,  i have to admit i was very impressed by this film .  as a fan of black and white films generally ,  passport to pimlico ,  the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder  ( who is apparently a distant relative )  ,  this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour .  i notice that there are some on here who have criticised askey's performance ,  however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now . if you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of it , shame these films generally aren't shown on sunday afternoons anymore . i am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley  ( private godfrey in dad's army )  . i thank you
this is best comedy i ever seen !  but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie !   :  )  overall one of best film i ever seen .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  vachtangi ( benjamin )  and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of kote daoshvili  ( father germogel )  is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films  :  )  )  in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite xvichia , sergo zakariadze , sofiko chiaureli , verikoan djafaridze , sesilia takaishvili , dodo abashidze .  .  .  .  they all are stars in georgian cinematography  :  )  plus in this movie is playing great russian star evgeni leonov and of course director of the film georgy danelia is one of the best .  .  .  .  .  .  i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie
perhaps i'm out of date or just don't know what electra is like in current publications .  .  .  but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan .  she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved .  just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way .   this movie was fairly weak on the dialog ,  the acting wasn't particularly convincing ,  and the action was spotty .  i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller's book  " electra assassin .  "  which is much darker than anything in this movie .   special effect where cool ,  action was interesting at times ,  but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical .  tha hand was not menacing enough ,  and electra was not .  .  .  .  .  bitchy enough .  she's the girl you love to hate .  .  .  but in this story ,  i just didn't care either way . 
this is surely one of the worst films ever made .  each scene is painful .  you will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor ,  the awkward camera work ,  the sexism and racism ,  the ridiculous story line ,  the wooden acting .  poor joan bennett ;  she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment .  in all ,  dreadful . 
dolph lundgren stars as murray wilson an alcoholic ex-cop who gets involved with a serial killer who kills during sex ,  after his brother is murdered ,  wilson starts his own investigation and finds out a lot of his brother's secrets in this very dull thriller .  lundgren mails in his performance and the movie is flat and lethargic .  also when has anyone watched a dolph lundgren movie for anything but action ? 
it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not .  not only did he leave the plot behind ,  he made up his own !  the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel .  the plot was hazy ,  inconsistent and choppy to say the least .  i don't want to say anything mean-spirited about the actors ,  but they can't act !  dickens is difficult ,  of course ,  but this is pathetic !  micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century kramer ,  and the less said about betsy trotwood the better !  if you want to see the real copperfield ,  watch the wonderful 1999 bbc adaptation .  as for the screenplay writer , i think he read the cliff's notes ! 
i'm sorry but this is just awful .  i have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me .  there is nothing wrong with the idea ,  modern day japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything .  when the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say  " hey my watch has stopped "  ?  imagine lines like that being repeated 15+ times before they say anything else and you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell . 
this movie is like the thousand  " cat and mouse "  movies that preceded it .   ( the following may look like a spoiler ,  but it really just describes a large class of movies )  there is the passionate ,  wise main character ,  his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments ,  the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable  " unlikely "  love story ,  the loved ones taken hostage ,  and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions .  everybody has seen tons of these movies already ,  and  " national treasure "  is like any one of them ,  with only a slightly modified wrapping .  every turn of the story was easily predicted  ( and i can assure you i am not the sharpest tool in the shed )  .  i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a hollywood movie ,  and if you have ever felt that way too ,  heed my warning ;  stay miles away from this movie . 
first off i'd like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10 ,  then i'd give it a -4 .  it's not that i'm a tough critic ,  it's just that this movie is that bad .  everything from the story ,  to the directing ,  to the editing is awful .  the story is not even halfway decent to begin with  ( you can't expect much since it is based on a video game ,  something i was not aware of going into the movie )  but the directing and editing made it even worse .  the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones ;  some ,  like a quick sex scene in the middle ,  don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other .  you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed .  honestly ,  if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money ,  and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life .  so do yourself a favor and don't watch it . 
neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple--a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment .   lemmon is neatnik felix ungar ,  bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison  ( matthau )  with somewhat disastrous results .  seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other's ways ,  with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite .   funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date .  the priceless interaction between lemmon ,  matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches .  the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters  ( a pair of geese )  in disney's the aristocats ,  and here--their comic timing on top of lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity--where it remains much of the time .   if you're a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work ,  this one is not to be missed .  matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast  ( even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began )  and ,  of course ,  it's easy to see why it became a top-rated tv show later on .   summing up :  top simon comedy ,  not to be missed . 
one of the great mysteries of life ,  suffered from daily ,  is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys .   worse ,  when the nice guys even want to marry those girls ,  the girls still prefer the jerks and heels ,  even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt ,  have shown they're just interested in using the girls .   stu erwin is the nice guy ,  who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely .   clark gable is the jerk ,  and he is perfect in the role ,  rather a sad note to his fans .   jean harlow comes across as a more slender mae west ,  even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway lines .   somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters ,  intended to be bad guys -- i mean ,  heck ,  they're locked up ,  so they must be -- are so obviously nice people .   in fact ,  there are lots of nice people here ,  people who ,  in a lesser film or story ,  would be snarling and back-stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else .   so ,  maybe the story is rather clichéd ,  at least by modern standards ,  but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched .   the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit .  once again ,  we can say a fervent  " thank you "  to imdb . com . 
i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst .  the gorilla looks just terrific ,  and the eyes were especially lifelike .  it's even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top .  rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine .  usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla .  it's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans ,  how they feel the same emotions we do ,  and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't .  not many films venture into this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity . 
after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie-goers .  there are the ones who are well read ,  extremely literate ,  and intelligent .  they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author .  for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature .  considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre-pubescent teenagers .  today's well read fan knows well this history ,  and knows the great authors asimov ,  heinlein ,  bradbury ,  and ellison ,  who helped bring science fiction out of that basement .  in doing so they created thought provoking ,  intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition .  this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them .  they are not critical for it's own sake ,  but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye .   ( as they should as hollywood's record has been less than stellar .  )  to these fans the story must take supreme importance .  they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics ,  and non stop action sequences .  when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest .   the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre .   ( look at many of the above comments that state  " well i haven't read the book or anything by this author .  .  .  )  their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel .  they are extremely uncritical ,  willing to overlook huge plot holes ,  weak premises ,  and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects .  they are ,  in effect ,  willing to turn off their critical thinking skills  ( or maybe they never had them !  )  for the duration of the movie .  case in point ,  i robot .  while supposedly based on asimov's short stories and named after one of his novels ,  it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations .   ( those of you that will run out and buy i ,  robot will be very much surprised-this movie isn't even based on that story at all !  )    the film has enormous plot holes ,  that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity .  i won't point them out .  i won't spoon feed you .  you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself .  the characters ,  which are named after many of asimov's characters ,  do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories .  the plot itself with all it's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for .  his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds ,  not their fists ,  is vital to understanding his vision of the future .  in short ,  other than the name ,  their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie .  there will always be those uncritical  ( i . e .  unthinking )  who will state :   " the movie doesn't have to be like the book .  due to the medium ,  movies sometimes require that changes be made .  "  but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book  ( or books )  from the start ?  what if all they took from the written work was the title ?  this begs the question :  why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it's title on your vacuous piece of crap ?  save money and don't buy the rights to the works .  title it something else .  don't use the character's names .  believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism .  in fact it won't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him .  but it will upset those who read ,  who think ,  who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show .    i ,  robot ,  like much of hollywood's take on the genre ,  pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago .  hollywood could not do this alone .  it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this . 
really ,  i liked it .  the premise was good ,  the story fit where both respective series left off ,  and here's my favorite part .  mary and valerie aren't bitter !  they aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it ,  or do possible reunions  ( a prime example is susan dey ,   " the partridge family "  )  .  in fact ,  valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie ,  and then mary said the same thing later ,  so i would be on the look for another .  .  . but if that doesn't quite work out ,  then they can re-run this one . 
richard brooks' the last hunt was a film star stewart granger couldn't even stand to hear mentioned  he even tore up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for signing in his later years  but then the director did run off with his wife ,  so it's understandable .  for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the 50s ,  and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment .   in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony mann's westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way .  here granger's legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but ,  after a buffalo stampede costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice ,  he's dragged back into the darkness by robert taylor's callous and proudly racist gunslinger ,  justifying it on the grounds that  " i've already got the guilty conscience .  i might as well have the money as well .  "  raised by indians ,  he's fully aware of the damage he's doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction ,  and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self-loathing as taylor is with hate .  when the two men fall out over debra paget's squaw  the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills  and a white buffalo hide that's priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons ,  a showdown becomes inevitable ,  though the outcome certainly isn't .   taylor's is certainly ironic casting  it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like quo vadis and ivanhoe that gave taylor his 50s comeback after years of steady decline .  his hair color may not convince but his performance does ,  a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn't wear a gun ,  the gun wears him .  granger's accent isn't always convincing ,  but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold ,  trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends .  russ tamblyn's halfbreed skinner and lloyd nolan's one-legged old-timer also give as good as they get ,  but the real star is the script :  tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character  not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining  it balances historical revisionism with entertaining drama without ever selling either short .  the new french dvd is extras-free but does boast a 2 . 35 : 1 transfer with an english soundtrack . 
the writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity .  did writer's block set in so badly ,  or had ideas dried up so much ,  that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van ,  and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind  ( mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth )  .  we had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint ,  as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting ;  once would have sufficed .  .  .  we got the message !  this really is taking toilet humour to another level !  had the script and acting been better then i could have easily forgotten that i was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video .  this was a fairly original storyline ,  with a clever  ( the only )  piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van ;  thus making it feel much more real .  we never got to see inside any other locations ,  such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared ,  and this could have added much needed tension .   the script was dire .  lines like :  'i don't feel too good .  .  .  i want to go home' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath ;  subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at ,  seem a little undercooked .   the acting was diabolical  ( apart from the maniac )  .  did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike !  the sound was so bad that i had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on .   the director seemed to have an easy job in this .  it seems that the only direction he must have given was :  'scream girls' .   and as for the screaming .  .  .  .  .  .  if you watch this please be sure to have some paracetamol at the ready ! 
steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't win by directing special effects epics  ( he was nominated for three of them :   " close encounters of the third kind "  ,   " raiders of the lost ark "  ,  and  " e . t .  :  the extra-terrestrial "  .  so he decided to get very serious by directing  " the color purple "  ,  a period film with no special effects .  spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie .  but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give spielberg any respect .   " the color purple "  received 11 oscar nominations including best picture ,  but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasn't nominated for best director .  it got worse on oscar night when this film didn't win a single oscar .  it got completely shut out .  that wasn't right .   " the color purple "  should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldberg's spectacular film debut as celie ,  a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband  ( frightfully placed by danny glover )  ,  then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends .  oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia ,  one of those friends' of celie .  since i'm from chicago ,  i had already known winfrey from her talk show  ( which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide )  .  like goldberg ,  what a film debut !  margaret avery is terrific as shug avery ,  another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celie's rotten husband .  all three actresses received well-deserved oscar nominations for their work here  ( goldberg for best actress ;  winfrey and avery for best supporting actress )  .  set in the south during the first half of the 20th century ,   " the color purple "  is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end .  it also made me laugh at times too .  why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today .  but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for  " schindler's list "  and  " saving private ryan "  ,  making him one of the best movie directors of all-time .  but he should have gotten nominated for this movie .  the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like  " e . t .  "  to a serious drama like  " the color purple "  was remarkable .   ****  ( out of four ) 
this movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing american patriot actor -- one that believes his work  ( and politics )  are as crucial to the american people as the opinions of the president himself .  alan bates captures this mindset perfectly as michael baytes ,  and i will immortally remember bates as this character .  this is a movie for canadians and americans alike .  it is a valuable piece of cinema ,  that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces .  wonderfully ,   " hollywood north "  does not suffer from the subject that it portrays :  peter o'brian directs with precision and complete control ,  and commands both the serious 'behind-the-scenes' portion of the movie ,  and the movie-within-the-movie ,   " flight to bogota "  with clarity and insight .  if you are at all interested in the wit and strength of canadian cinema ,   " hollywood north "  is a great place to start . 
this was a horrible film !  i gave it 2 points ,  one for angelina jolie and a second one for the beautiful porsche in the beginning .  .  .  other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in 1970 .  the happyend was probably what annoyed me the most ,  seldomly seen anything so constructed ! 
i just watched the convent for the second time .  i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film ,  some gore ,  some style ,  bit of humour and suchlike .  i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much .  it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile .  for the record i'm not even a huge fan of night of the demons ,  but there were some things i really dug about it .  the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much .  apart from the main girl  ( likeable performance from joanna canton )  ,  the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable ,  festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic ,  offensive jockhood .  the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that ,  given the awful dialogue ,  it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film .  the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes ,  though not scary their certainly kinda cool ,  and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore .  towards the end ,  when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy .  the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results ,  although sometimes the camera just moves too fast .  all in all ,  this was a film where for me the shining good points just can't make up for the things i hated .  those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more ,  but for me it wasn't a good time . 
henri verneuil represented the commercial cinema in france from 1960-1980 .  always strong at the box-office ,  and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies ,  mafia score-settling and world war ii battles ,  verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on saturday night .  he worked with the cream of the male actors of his day :  gabin ,  belmondo ,  fernandel ,  delon ,  sharif ,  anthony quinn .  i .  .  .  comme icare is the only time he directed yves montand .  it's an oddly static film ,  taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms ,  containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence .   montand gives a good performance ,  if somewhat dry ,  and he is well supported by the other actors .  i couldn't help wondering what costa-gavras could have done with this story ,  on the basis of z  ( the lambrakis assassination )  and l'aveu  ( the torture of artur london in czechoslovakia by stalinists )  . 
i watched it some years ago .  i remembered it as very mysterious situations ,  and a mixture of melancholic things ,  like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovich .   i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more .  nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version ,  at any price ,  please !   the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second ,  a bit of blueish ,  but also happy .   all the characters are great to me ,  with funny situations ,  great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs .  this may not be casualty .   i think that the title is a hope about life !  you have to be happy and laugh as much as possible  i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie ,  but the fact is that i like it very much ,  i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it . 
this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being .  the cinematography is good ,  the acting seemed solid ,  the dialogue wasn't too stiff .  .  .  but then about twenty minutes in there's this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor - and it just goes south from there .   on top of that ,  the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the godzilla-looking thing in curse of the demon .  there's also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of logan's run .   in the end ,  the cinematography couldn't save this movie .  despite some pretty solid performances by the actors ,  the story just doesn't go anywhere .  i think  " hellbored "  would have been a better title for this . 
come on !  get over with the pakistan bashing guys .  bollywood can not only make brilliant movies- but can seriously affect a generation of viewers .   i am a huge bollywood fan- but anti-pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay ,  cinematography ,  action sequences- everything .   i'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda ,  and there are movies like main hoon na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say :  give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses . 
vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 ,  coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career .  i am not too keen in romantic movies these days ,  because i see them as  " old wine in a new bottle "  and so predictable .  however ,  i have watched this movie three times now .  .  . and believe me it's an awesome movie .   vivah goes back to the traditional route ,  displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage .  the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do  ( or would do )  when it comes to marriage .  in that sense sooraj r .  barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie .   several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately :    * when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride  ( amrita rao )  - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family .  the song 'do anjaane ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene .   * the first conversation between shahid and amrita ,  when he comes to see her - i . e .  a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation .  also amrita's naive nature ,  limited eye-contact ,  shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid's questions .   * the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle  ( alok nath )  when she feeds him at shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece .   clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way .  the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her .  she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie ,  and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly .   shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too .  he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r .  barjatya film .  in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on-screen couple ,  without a shadow of doubt .  other characters - alok nath  ( excellent )  ,  anupam kher  ( brilliant )  ,  mohan joshi  ( very good )  .   on the whole ,  vivah delivers what it promised ,  a well made and realistic story of two families .  the movie has top-notch performances ,  excellent story and great music to suit the film ,  as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r .  barjatya .  it's a must see ! 
wow you guys are way too nice !  !  ! corny , corny , corny that is how i feel about that film . it started well with a good idea  ,  a guy  ( edward asner )  escape from jail dressed as santa , a bunch of kids find him and believes his the real santa so the fake santa enlist the children to help him find a bag of stolen money . the film is like a christmas version of  " whistle down the wind "  .  the movie start well but gradually it becomes cheesier and cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously .  for example you get the scrooge type character called sumner  ( rene auberjonois )  who's a total douchebag who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish  , he treat his son so bad that he don't even buy him decent clothes , the poor kid wears jeans with holes in it !  but a 45 second scene with fake santa visiting sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing christmas carol and giving his neglected son a hug .  .  . yep that is how corny it is .  .  .  i'm all for feel good movie especially during christmas and i am a big fan of seasonal tv movie but this one is way too over the top for me , it is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film that just don't match with the rest of it .  it's not totally bad , there are some solid acting  ,  especially from the children but there are plenty of better christmas film around . 
the trouble with the book ,   " memoirs of a geisha "  is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american man's way of thinking .  reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music ,  sets ,  and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters .   the movie isn't about japan or real geisha .  it is a story about a few american men's mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions .  so what is this movie if it isn't about japan or geisha ?  is it pure fantasy as so many people have said ?  yes ,  but then why make it into an american fantasy ?   there were so many missed opportunities .  imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups ,  no connotations of sin about sex .  sex is natural and normal .  how is sex handled in this movie ?  right .  like it was dirty .  the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch .    does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie ?  nope .  one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty .  such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha .   did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off ?  nope .  she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block .  of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it .  and that is what i mean about this movie .  why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy ?  why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong ?   behind mameha the chairman was sayuri's secret patron ,  and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity .  he could have rigged the auction and won her himself .  nobu didn't even bid .  so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and ,  reeking of old-man stink ,  get his fingers all over her naked body ?  would any woman ever really forgive a man for that ?   let's try to make sense of this .  by being behind mameha the chairman incurred debts for sayuri's geisha training .  in order to recoup his debts the chairman had sayuri sold to dr .  crab .  through mameha the chairman sold sayuri's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the chairman could make some money out of her .  the chairman wasn't her patron .  he was her pimp !  some romantic love story .   yes ,  the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive ,  alluring transvestite whose voice ,  appearance and every touch are thrilling .  but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret .  under the incorrectly appearing japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart ,  soul ,  spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male .  not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie ,  distortion ,  and terribly wrong .   some contrasts between japan and moag :   japanese style  refined ,  elegant simplicity .  moag style  peking opera .   japanese geisha  hair swept up .  moag geisha  loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup .   japanese shaved ice - japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances .  shaved ice is strictly a summer treat .  moag shaved ice - the chairman buys chiyo ,  the young sayuri played by the marvelous suzuka ohgo ,  this treat during cherry-blossom-viewing season .  the thought made my entire body shiver with cold .   japanese geisha  trained and skilled entertainers .  moag geisha - sluts .   japanese wind chime - used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes ,  thanks to the breeze ,  japanese people feel somehow cooler .  moag wind chime - a door bell !  if a person stood in front of another's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic ,  not gain entrance .   japan  emphasis on human relationships ,  group oriented .  moag   " i want a life that's mine "  american individualism .   japanese traditional dance  refined elegance .  an almost geometrical and mechanical precision .  moag dance  martha graham freaking out on lsd while wearing a not-very-auspicious white japanese funeral shroud .  performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club ?  ha ha ha !  is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha ?   japan house fire  setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community .  fires can rip through those wooden villages ,  towns ,  and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people .  moag house fire - great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out-of-control fire miraculously puts itself out .  technically the movie ended here because at the very least sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again .  which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be exiled .   enough .  the movie stinks . 
i stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago ,  and fell in love with it .  it features téa leoni and holland taylor and kept me laughing ,  one episode after the next .  i guess it didn't make it so big ,  and was cancelled after a few seasons ,  but i believe it was a good run ,  and would suggest watching it .  .  . if the opportunity arises . 
madhur has given us a powerful movie chandni bar in the past .  his next film page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time .  it apparently tells the story of some high class people in india .  after seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to star in a movie .  i felt like spitting and breaking the dvd .  coincidently i did .  the reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation .  i literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children .  very disturbing stuff ,  there was no need to show the children fully naked .  one of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people ,  british men in this movie .  i am shocked to know this film was a hit in parts of india ,  otherwise super flop in uk ,  usa and australia .  i'm from uk ,  and this kind of stuff makes me sick ,  shouldn't of been released in uk . 
another one of those films you hear about from friends  (  .  .  . or read about on imdb )  .  not many false notes in this one .  i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead-end home town in tennessee to florida ,  with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten-up car .   the heroine ,  ruby ,  makes some false starts ,  but learns from them .  i found myself wondering why ,  why didn't she lean a bit more on mike's shoulder ,  but .  .  . she has her reasons ,  as it turns out .   just a fine film .  the only thing i don't much like about it ,  i think ,  is the title . 
cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters .  one day ,  a ball is to be held in honor of the prince ,  but cinderella has no chance of going ,  because her stepmother and stepsisters won't let her .  with the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends ,  she is off to the ball ,  with the warning to return home by midnight .  at the ball she meets the handsome prince charming .  when the clock strikes midnight ,  she runs home ,  leaving behind one of her glass slippers .  with the help of her animal friends ,  her true identity is revealed .  she and the prince later get married ,  and they live happily ever after .   cinderella ,  released 56 years ago ,  was a huge box office success ,  and it continues to charm audiences to this day .  it has a well-written script .  the characters are memorable .  the songs ,  including  " a dream is a wish your heart makes "  ,   " so this is love "  ,  and the great  " bibbidi-bobbidi-boo "  ,  help tell the story .  this was my favorite movie growing up ,  and it hasn't lost any of its charm .  a true disney masterpiece !  recommended .  10/10 p . s .  the recent dvd release is the best way to appreciate this film ,  including featurettes ,  deleted scenes ,  music video ,  vintage radio programs ,  and a restored print of the movie ! 
i'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography .  otherwise ,  it teems mainly with clichés and stereotypes :  mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind ,  or wise white indians .  indians are magical people who move around without a sound ,  can disappear in the blink of an eye ,  talk to animals ,  and read minds over large distances .  and so on and so forth .   throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was  ( other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains ,  log cabins ,  woods ,  an assortment of animals ,  free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church )  .   the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth .  this was neither a story about growing up during the depression ,  nor about about being an orphan ,  nor about a struggle for identity .  it tried to be all of those things and more ,  which made it superficial and unsatisfactory .   although the movie was supposed to be about little tree's education ,  we learn almost nothing about it .  he was given a brief summary of the history of his people  ( who were brave and stoic )  and a distillery demonstration ;  tried his hand at chopping wood  ( at which he failed )  and whiskey running  ( literally )  ;  learned how to read  ( and maybe to write )  with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it .  apparently he didn't learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic .   however ,  grandma and grandpa and graham greene's character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - after ,  and i'm paraphrasing here ,   " riding with the navajos "  and  " getting caught up in a couple of wars "  - was to  " catch up "  with grandma and grandpa and graham greene's character in heaven  ( instead of ,  say ,  dating girls ,  getting married ,  having children or other such nonsense )  .   last but not least i must say that i found grandpa's trade offensive .  why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still ?  to counteract the stereotype of the  " drunken indian "  ? 
watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me .  it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the  ( non ) action - and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbo-croat indie and find them fascinating .   the tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over-orchestrated .  one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue ,  apart from the set pieces where characters 'collide' in a very structured setting  ( to make this work ,  the film needed to feel more conceptual ,  which it didn't )  .  this leads to a lack of realistic character development ;  everyone seems two-dimensional .   the worse for this is the character of bill spear ,  aka snoop dogg .  i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic .  at one point ,  i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the character's aggressive ,  violent and monotonal delivery ,  the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary  " on "  switch  ( which gets really predictable after a while )  and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities .  however ,  one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film  ( supposedly 70s ,  it feels and looks more early noughties )  .  if it had been more securely fixed in the 70s ,  his character might have seemed more understandable .   the lighting of the film was also awkward .  all the way through ,  the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty ,  jazz-infused atmosphere that just did not come off ,  largely because the set was too well-lit .   the tenants ,  to me ,  is an unbelievable film .  it doesn't depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race ,  identity or the life of a writer ,  be they white or black .   strangely ,  i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch ;  his eerie ,  clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable . 
i believe i received this film when i was a young buck .  i remembered watching it as a child ,  but i could never find the film .  i remembered good ol rageddy ann ,  andy ,  babette ,  the greedy ,  king koo koo .  i searched high and low for this movie and still no luck .  but one day when i was moving out of my childhood home i had found it .  we were reunited .  i am 17 years old now .  i still watch it .  all the time actually .  it's one of the funniest and touching movies i have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time .  and personally i think they should make a sequel .  mmm ,  yes a sequel indeed .  now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body ! 
 " unhinged "  is one strange little film ,  a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre .  it's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique .  it's plot is fairly overdone--three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter .  very quickly ,  the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic .  on top of that ,  the mother and daughter seem to have a very ,  very strange relationship ,  as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner .  the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them .  halfway through the film ,  when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help ,  the killing begins .    as far as the acting goes ,  this film is at the bottom of the barrel .  none of the three stranded girls can act ,  particularly the  " lead "  girl .  it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same ,  wooden tone throughout the film .  the mother and daughter are better ,  but not much .  the film is also quite dull in parts and really ,  really drags .  the killings are gruesome ,  but nothing we haven't seen before .  however ,  as mentioned on here ,  the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending .  it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic  " sleepaway camp .  "  unfortunately ,  the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring ,  boring pacing .  the isolated ,  creepy looking mansion and the dark ,  foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism ,  but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act .  it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end ,  but i say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes .  4 out 10
eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand-up concert film i have ever seen .  most stand-up acts usually have lulls at some point ,  but not this one folks .  for 90 min there is not one moment that is not side-splittingly funny .  from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead-on impression of mr . t ,  the laughs are non-stop .   sadly ,  this was done in 1983 ,  and eddie hasn't done anything nearly as funny .  it's unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show ,  wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all .   eddie ,  if you're out there ,  please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious .  believe me your fans will love you for it .  and i think you know that . 
worst movie ever !  !  !  !  can't believe i wasted 90min of my life watching this crap .  the only reason i didn't turn it off was i wanted to see the gangster dude on the cover and he wasn't even in it talk about false advertising .  the people that gave this movie a ten are either dumb , stupid or cast members or friends of cast members .   i gave it a solid 2 because no one else did  i have to write more and i don't even want to .  wasting my time talking about this rubbish .  please don't watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs .  bottom 100 movies .  i can't even tell you how bad it really is .  think the worst movie ever that you've seen then times that be ten and thats this movie .  it sucked !  !  if you just think i'm being bitter then watch it i dare you !  !  this movie should be used to torture war criminals or terriosts .  if they watch this even two times and they'll be spilling the beans and begging for mercy !  ! 
this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham's short tales .  the first one is the verger ,  which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable .  after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can't read nor write .  so what does he do ?  opens a tobacco shop ,  of course !   the second is mr .  know-all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten ,  until i heard the familiar introduction .  another 15 minute one ,  and also very good .  it worked better on film than in a book for me ,  but then perhaps that's because i was only 14 the last time ,  afterall .   the 3rd one is nearly a let-down .  almost an hour in length ,  it simply drags .  it's not all that bad ,  but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 .  i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour ,  and found that it still made sense and really i hadn't missed a thing !   overall i give them 8 ,  9 ,  and 6 out of 10 ,  respectively . 
schizophreniac :  the whore mangler is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of untalented people together to make an  " extreme "  horror film .  any sort of acting ,  production ,  storyline ,  fx ,  etc .  .  . go out the window in an effort to create  " shock-value "  .  now don't get me wrong - i consider myself a connoisseur of  " shock "  films ,  and the sleazier/gorier/nastier the better - but it's still nice to see some sort of talent from someone involved in the film .   schizophreniac chronicles the life of harry russo - a drug-addicted freak-show who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquist's dummy ,  rubberneck .  he goes on a few sprees killing hookers and other random people ,  and screaming about how much he hates  " hoo-uhs "   ( that's  " whores "  for those of you that don't speak new york-ese .  .  .  )  and how he wants to rape them in the ass .  there are a few weak necrophilia scenes ,  very little gore ,  and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing that you haven't seen in a better film .  .  .   the only redeeming thing that i can find in this retarded film are the often  ( unintentionally ?  )  hilarious screaming-fits from our main man ,  harry .  he goes on-and-on-and-on about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass ,  and it really becomes quite comical after a while .  in fact ,  i'm almost tempted to believe that there's supposed to be some sort of homo-erotic undertone to this film ,  with all the ass talk and constant shots of harry running around with his dong hangin' out .  in all honesty ,  that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some t-and-a  ( and some full-frontal ,  for good measure )  .  schizophreniac is mildly amusing as a 1-time watch ,  but i can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called schizophreniac :  the whore mangler .  to be honest - the title ,  by far - is the best thing about this trash .  .  . a generous 3 . 5/10
for whoever play games video games here did anybody notice that the gta : vice city mansion inside the game and some other things including weapons from the movie that are connected to this movie and this movie inspired the makers of the game  ( rockstar games )  to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best 80's movies out there i recommend this for anybody who still didn't see it 10/10 no questions asked
i first flicked onto the log accidentally one night while waching television :  since then ,  i have never missed an episode .   it's humour is very weird ,  like a cross between brass eye's social commentary ,  the fast show's excellent one-liners ,  and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere .  the best example of this was hillary briss's special stuff - what was that all about ?   the humour will not appeal to all .  some will say it's just too sick ,  and it's easy to see where they're coming from .  nonetheless ,  give it a try .  if you don't like it ,  don't watch it ,  but if you do like it you'll be very glad you took my advice . 
caught this film at the arizona international film festival .  i wasn't expecting a lot  ( though the festival's director told me it was one of the best films submitted )  .  five minutes into it i was sold .  shot in b & w on a shoestring budget ,  this film is hilarious .  the acting is solid ,  the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid .  the acting is probably the biggest revelation ,  since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting .  not this one .  it features one of the most convincing ,  endearing and funny portrayals of a character with tourette's syndrome i've ever seen .  the plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous .  if you get the chance ,  see this movie .  filmmakers like majkowski  ( hope i got that right )  deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience . 
the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie i've ever seen ,  but it is pretty far down on the list .  when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i ,  one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions .  and he succeeds ,  at least at first .  a love triangle complicates the story some .   this really was a tedious movie ,  with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren't .  the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable  ( not the zombie part of it but parts related to the  " romance "  )  .  and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography ,  the camera work didn't seem to help the film much either .   while i have seen a few movies that are worse ,  this is unlikely to please anyone .  it's bad ,  and not in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way . 
this movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a sci fi movie .  the worst tendency in sci-fi is to make your theme an awful ,  sophomoric ,  pseudo-orwellian/huxleyan/whateverian  " vision "  of  " the human future .  "   science fiction filmmakers  ( and authors )  ,  as geeks ,  take themselves very seriously given the high crap-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre .  i think other genres with a high ctgsr  ( yes ,  i just made it up ,  relax )  ,  like horror or action or even romantic comedy ,  seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound  " message .  "   sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level ,  as numerous great filmmakers have proven .  but there is an immense downside to the whole concept ,  which is represented by  " robot jox ,  "  with its low-rent construction of  " the future "   ( lone good design element :  the bizarre ,  slick-looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies )  and its painfully heavy-handed  " iliad "  parallels  ( he's named achilles for god's sake !  i actually didn't pick up on this until i saw the film for like the tenth time ,  but i went to public school ,  so the filmmakers are not exonerated .  )   of course ,  if you're a crazy movie freak like me ,  this downside has a great upside .  i absolutely love movies like this ,  because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones .  it's kind of a lester bangs approach to movie viewing ,  i guess .   note :  the lead in this movie  ( gary graham ?  is that his name ?  i refuse to go check .  )  is really not that bad .  he makes a go of it .  he's kind of cool ,  especially when he's drunk/hung over . 
reign over me  ( titled after the who song )  is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyone's eye .  it was a moving story of a guy  ( sandler )  that lost his family in the 9-11 world trade center attacks .  years later ,  he runs into an old college roommate  ( cheadle )  that he doesn't even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress ensued by the loss of his family .  the two rekindle their old friendship and cheadle's character ,  johnson ,  realizes that he must get sandler's character ,  fineman ,  some help before it's too late .   this was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time .  it's completely worth watching and after seeing it ,  i'm positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more . 
i recently watched this film at the 30'th gothenburg film festival ,  and to be honest it was on of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to watch .  don't get me wrong ,  there are the funny and entertaining bad films  ( e . g  " manos  hands of fate "  )  and then there are the awful bad films .   ( this one falls into the latter category )  .  the cinematography was unbelievable ,  and not in a good way .  it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus  ( with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot )  ,  the lighting was something between  " one guy running around with a light bulb "  and  " non existing "  .  the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors ,  and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them .  the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer ,  a classic look a la jason vorhees from  " friday the 13'th "  .  the plot was extremely poor ,  and the ending even worse .  i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like ,  or maybe an insomniac needing sleep . 
i just rented  ( yes !  i paid money to see !  )  this film .  omg .  it is one of the very worst films i have ever seen .  as another reviewer put it ,  ms .  colagrande ,  get out of films ,  please !  please never make or appear in another film !  the lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe .  no ,  that's not fair to the cantaloupe ,  which probably has more going for it .  she does not know how to act ;  she affects a disgusted look all the time  ( reminded me very much of my always-disgusted young sisters-in-law from europe )  .  she is not charming ;  she is not pretty .  there is no real story .  and the editing !  there wasn't any ,  that i could see !  it's pretty bad when you are watching a film and ,  just to get through it ,  you press  " forward forward "  on your remote ,  and still nothing happens !  i mean !  .  .  .  .  .  i kept involuntarily screaming ,   " cut !  cut !  "  what were they thinking ?  well ,  obviously ,  they thought they would make a film together and get paid to make love on screen !  pretty good deal for them ;  pretty raw deal for the viewer !  i think i'm going to throw up now .  .  .  . 
i guess there are some out there that remember nicole eggert from her little girl days on such tv shows as t . j .  hooker ,  charles in charge ,  and who's the boss ?  you perverts ,  you !  maybe you remember her from baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants .  no matter ,  you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man-eating aliens .   there are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained .  how did she recognize the alien ?  why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon ?  why didn't the alien eat her ?  you get the picture .   before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity ,  you get to see her in the body of alex meneses .  this mexican/ukranian beauty is the only reason to watch this trash .  stay for the shower scene and the boyfriend ,  and go on about your business . 
the cover of box of this movie has kyle minogue's name on it ,  but she has the same destiny as drew barrymore did in  " scream .  "  that's the first thing that makes this movie lame ;  they are trying to market a movie with someone that's in it for 5 minutes .   of course ,  we have to have this movie feature young hip college kids that are oblivious that there's a killer going around .  to top it all off ,  molly ringwald of 80's teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film .  it's a good career move for molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in australia so she won't get ridiculed in the states .   either way ,  this dumb movie is about some dumb horror movie that was never finished because this dumb creature kills everyone that's in it .  throughout the movie ,  we're supposed to guess who's the killer .  long story short ,  remember our little friend molly ,  she saves the day .  .  . or does she ?   this move is just plain bad ,  rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf .  don't spread the horror . 
a thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims ,  along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine ,  and here susan lucci performs as a siren ,  although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one .  isabelle  ( lucci )  ,  inconstant wife of venture capitalist stewart collins  ( john o'hurley )  ,  begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis  ( philip casnoff )  ,  simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard ,  apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent .  when davis becomes convinced that guileful isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband ,  he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself ,  coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent stewart .  in the wake of the hit-man's assault upon collins ,  a pair of police detectives ,  performed by joe grifasi and dean mcdermott ,  become increasingly curious concerning isabelle's possible involvement in the crime ,  while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering .  lucci and kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators ,  each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds ,  but o'hurley and mcdermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements .  released upon a fremantle dvd ,  this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality ,  and although no extra features are provided ,  the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer robert primes and composer stephen edwards . 
why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers ?  that point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie .   i think sports movies fall into two categories ;  well made movies about the human spirit and competitions ,  and `by the sword' .   honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be ,  a touching drama for trying to be your best in life ,  an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick .  in the end it didn't do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it .   for the record i also am a fencing instructor  ( and now i am officially as bad as the rest )  .  but putting bad fencing in a movie doesn't make it bad automatically .  i mean look at star wars  ( episodes 4-6 ,  good movies ,  bad fencing )  .  i liked those movies .  but when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort .   don't be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing .  this is just a bad movie .  in the end ,  this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells .   when i see a movie and am forced to think ,  `man ,  i wish i was watching the mighty ducks . ' i know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back . 
well ,  if you are open-minded enough to have liked barber shop ,  then you will like this canadian film .   if your mind is as closed-minded as fort knox ,  then you will give it the current score that it has  :  2 . 5 .   this is a film for anybody prepared to watch films from outside of their own racial grounds .  it is engaging ,  it is true to life ,  on two or three occasions you lose the connections between the scenes ,  but many times ,  especially towards the end ,  you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often mirrors what life can be like .   i like it and recommend it to anyone open minded beyond the traditional american film . 
in a variant of sholay  ,  ram gopal verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape .  the thakur goes south . mohanlal as narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance madrasi style .  the accent is totally south indian in contrast to thakur from the north .  the severing of the hands of thakur by gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in aag .  so make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered kurta covers up for the cut fingers .  moreso in the climax where the thakur uses his legs and says " tere liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai "  here narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain .  babban ,  the new avtar of gabbar is also different .  he is not from bihar or up .  he is bambaiya .  gabbar's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued .  babban asks for diwali instead of holi and romances urmila the replacement of helen in mehbooba .  he also dances and enjoys dancing with abhisheh who plays jalal agha in mehbooba . babban is more intelligent this time .  he tosses the apple and asks the question that made isaac newton discover laws of gravitation .  basanti is more verbose than the auto driver ghungroo .  nisha kothari cannot play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like 'entertain' and 'too much' with gay abandon .  viru was fun whereas ajay devgun is a misfit for the role .  the god speaks to basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the koi haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful .  the water tank turns into a well and the drunk devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide .  jai was composed and serious .  prashant raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him .  but he also bungles on the mausi sequence .  he is not as romantic as jai with the mouth organ  .  jaya's role played by sushmita changes careers .  a pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed .  she too lacks the pain that jaya displayed .  her flirtations with jai are more open this time .  samba gets a bigger role this time as tambe .  he does not have to point guns and answer questions of gabbar this time .  he follows babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den .  horses give way to jeeps and auto .  the gabbar's hideout here keeps changing and ramgarh becomes kaliganj .  all in all it is more of a spoof than anything else .  rgv comes up with his own interpretation of the classic .  but we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues .  so we call it a spoof .  so mr . rgv ( sholay  )  and farhan akhtar  ( don )  and jpdutta ( umrao jaan )  stop making remixes and start making originals . 
let me start by saying that i'd read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect .  still ,  i was surprised by just how bad it was .    i am a big werewolf fan ,  and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one .  most of them have sub-par effects ,  poor acting ,  and weak storylines  ( at best rehashed from earlier films )  .  so far ,  with the possible exception of some of the later  " howling "  series films ,  this is the worst of the lot .   first ,  the story .  it's been quoted several times in reviews on this site ,  so i won't go into specifics .  however ,  it is very obvious that the writer ( s )  had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters .  as so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves  " above "  such fare ,  they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos .  that's fine ,  but a non-horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them .  the plot feels like a parody of werewolf films ,  and the events depicted just ring so false that i felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted .  tv news footage ,  for example ,  never pans away from the reporter to close-up on someone in the crowd behind them .  give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign .  and that's just the tip of the iceberg .   as for effects ,  i have never seen a less believable werewolf .  i'd have been happier with lon chaney jr .  in crepe hair .  the beast they used look a great deal like .  .  .  well ,  like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics .  and ,  i know that many people have already criticized the cg ,  but my god it was awful .  one scene features a woman changing ,  and starts with a completely cg version of the actress ,  nude but for some reason without nipples .  my first thought was ,   " hey ,  why is one of the characters from 'reboot' turning into a silly looking werewolf ?  "   anyway ,  i like to look for positives in any film ,  and there were a few .  the cinematography was passable  ( the film was shot all-digital ,  which is interesting )  and some of the performances were not terrible .  it was also interesting seeing tippi hedron as the world's most well made-up homeless woman ,  and kane hodder as the title bad guy .  also ,  the yellow power ranger got all growed up and .  .  .  well ,  damn .  and if you're looking for skin ,  there's some pretty tasty examples .  this ends the male-pig segment of the review .   overall ,  if you want a good werewolf film ,  try  " an american werewolf in london "  ,  the original  " the howling "  ,   " dog soldiers "  ,  or even  " the wolfen "   ( though that one's got more wolf than were )  .  if you're a lycanthrope completest ,  then take a gander .  otherwise ,  give this one a miss . 
i have watched anime but i'm not a die hard fan ;  and i don't read manga .  i say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background .  i have seen  " st .  john's wort ,  "  and although it isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination ,  it made me pick up  " shinobi ,  "  especially since everyone seems to love it .   well ,  i watched it this afternoon ,  and fought very hard to keep watching .  yes ,  it's very beautiful - the slow motion water scenes ,  the autumn leaves on the trees ,  even the cgi eye flicker - majestic .  i liked the hawk ,  the costumes ,  even some of the fight scenes ,  but overall this was dull as dirt .   it seemed as if someone took  " romeo and juliet "  - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and threw in some  " x-men "  for good measure .  two of the characters split wolverine's powers - the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey-haired guy had his ability to heal himself .  then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - that's poison ivy  ( from batman )  .  why do they give these women such dumb powers ?  poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death .  man ,  that's some great power for you .  and the other girl ,  can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands .  the other woman ,  one of the star crossed lovers ,  has the power of a hypnotic stare .  wow .   i sort of made it to the end of the film ,  by fast forwarding it ,  and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected .  some people are comparing this to  " house of flying daggers "  and  " hero .  "  don't make that mistake .  they may share similar endings ,  but that's where the similarities end .   " shinobi "  is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker .   i would say avoid this film unless you're 12 to 18 years old . 
the release of tarzan the ape man ,  in 1932 ,  caused a sensation .  it may be hard to believe ,  70 years later ,  but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix ,  or the lord of the rings has achieved ,  at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment .  tarzan became an instant pop icon ,  the 'noble savage' that every woman fantasized about ,  and every man wished he could be .  the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs ,  who ,  while he'd agreed to mgm's creative liberties ,  and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks ,  felt the 'dumbed down' version of his character  ( with no plans to allow him to 'grow' )  was unfaithful to his vision  ( he would start a production company ,  and soon be making his own 'tarzan' films )  .  mgm ,  realizing the value of it's newest 'star' ,  knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original .  .  . and tarzan and his mate delivered !   the film had an interesting back story ;  cedric gibbons ,  mgm's legendary art director ,  had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel ,  prior to the release of tarzan the ape man ,  despite the fact that he'd never directed before  ( the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact ,  and didn't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty' film .  .  . and they wanted to keep their oscar-winning department chief happy )  .  gibbons ,  a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist ,  loved the freedom of pre-code hollywood ,  and decided to have tarzan and his mate 'push the envelope' to the limit .  .  . tarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim ,  and jane would appear topless through most of the film .  maureen o'sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death ,  in 1998 ,  that while a double was used for the swim ,  she trusted the studio ,  and did 'a couple of days' of filming sans top .  .  . but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples ,  and the idea was abandoned  ( the film shot those days would be worth a fortune !  )  she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent ,  flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her 'swim' ,  and donned a revised 'jungle' costume that was extremely provocative ,  very thin ,  and open at the sides .  .  . and the resulting outcry would help 'create' the hays office ,  and the self-censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry .   mgm yanked gibbons from the production  ( the 'official' reason given was his workload as art director )  ,  and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director ,  to appease the critics .  .  . although james c .  mckay actually directed the film ,  as conway was busy on 3 other projects ,  including viva villa !   the film incorporated the best elements of the original  ( safaris ,  murderous tribes ,  tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane )  ,  and actually improved on the storytelling .  harry holt  ( neil hamilton )  ,  from the first film ,  returns to africa for ivory from the 'elephants' graveyard' ,  and to try to seduce jane into returning to england ,  with gifts of silk dresses ,  underwear ,  and perfume .  he brings with him martin arlington  ( paul cavanagh )  ,  a crack shot and inveterate womanizer ,  who sneers at holt's chivalrous pursuit of jane ,  and stalks her as a potential 'conquest' ,  to be had by any means  ( including killing tarzan ,  if and when he can get away with it without being seen )  .   tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane ,  and puts his foot down ,  refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard .  arlington finds his opportunity ,  catching the ape man alone ,  and shoots him ,  then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise .  now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle ,  and she can direct them to the graveyard ,  before her long voyage back to england ,  comforted by the oh-so-sympathetic arlington .  but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group .  .  . can tarzan ,  being nursed back to health by his ape 'family' ,  recover in time to save jane ?   while stock footage is again used extensively ,  the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent ,  and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits ,  tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other 'tarzan' film ,  as well as a sexiness that even bo derek's blatantly erotic tarzan ,  the ape man couldn't touch .  johnny weissmuller was in peak condition ,  physically ,  maureen o'sullivan was never more beautiful ,  and 'africa' never looked more romantic ,  and dangerous .   tarzan and his mate was a triumph  ( although it would be drastically edited for many years )  ,  and remains the classic of the series ,  to this day ! 
after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river ,  why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel ?  it just wasn't the same without spur and harrison ,  as portrayed by douglas .  maybe he recognized how poor the plot was--jim returns after extended absence ,  to find jessica being pursued by another man .  he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him ,  and not find competition .  for a disney movie ,  this contains foul language ,  plus the highly unnecessary part when jim & jessica shacked up without being married--very lame .  quite an insult to viewer intelligence ,  according to members of my family .  i'll stick with the first one ,  and try to forget i ever saw the sequel ! 
this is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn't appear literally until half way in .  nevertheless i was engaged by the hook of the phantom lady .  curtis ,  though competent as the falsely accused scott henderson ,  looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards  ( perhaps he should have shaved his moustache )  and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence .  while another commentator had a problem with franchot tone as jack marlowe i found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex .  he is no stock villain .  superb character actor elisha cook jr .  is again in top form as the 'little man with big ambitions . ' his drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism .  this movie however is carried by the very capable and comely ella raines as the devoted would be lover of henderson ,  carol richmond .  she definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of lauren bacall .  this is the first of her work i have seen and i am definitely inclined to see her other roles .  the rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent .  all in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to .  recommended ,  8/10 . 
the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwin .   the main protagonist/antagonist jennifer stanton  ( hart )  is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father  ( baldwin )  .  however ,  when she meets an ex con called nick ryan  ( jeremy jordan  " never been kissed "  )  they instantly 'fall' for each other ,  but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship .  she manipulates him to kill her parents ,  to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad  ( david lascher future 'sabrina' cast mate for hart )  .  melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder .  the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time .  i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year ,  hart ,  began portrayed sabrina ,  the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television .   although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to 'nine dead' that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called  " clarissa darling  "  or sabrina spellman "   i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina .  you can watch this on the internet ,  so i suggest check it out . 
soldier blue is a movie with pretensions :  pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man's inhumanity to man ,  on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples ;  a biting ,  unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam .  well ,  sorry ,  but it fails miserably to be any of those things .  what soldier blue actually is is pernicious ,  trite ,  badly made ,  dishonest rubbish .   another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies .  what it is basically is a lame ,  clichéd ,  poorly acted  " odd couple "  romance - strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love  ( ah ,  bless )  - bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn't have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick .   there is no excuse for the repulsive ,  prurient ,  gore-drenched climax ,  in which cute little native american children are variously shot ,  sliced ,  dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close-up ,  and large-breasted native american women are molested ,  raped and strung up - no excuse ,  that is ,  except box office .   ( the massacre itself ,  whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention ,  is very badly staged and shot ;  a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them ,  intercut with a few special-effects sequences of beheading/dismemberment - dismemberments ,  incidentally ,  which utilised real amputees in their filming .  now that's what i call exploitation .  )   forget all the pap you've heard  ( including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie )  about this being a  " protest "  ,  an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples .  this film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne ;  had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters ,  would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless ,  faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax .  instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss  ( lousy actors both ,  in this at least )  ,  with plenty of blood ,  guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious .   which is a terrible shame ,  because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre ,  about all of the real life massacres the us  ( and britain ,  and all so-called  " civilised "  nations )  have participated in over the centuries  ( iraq ?  )  .  this just isn't that movie . 
this is a splendidly done simplistic film that explores a theme ,  and gives each viewer something different that they take from it .  the premise is simple :  an unnamed celebrity actor  ( morgan freeman )  decides to research for an upcoming role by visiting a store and watching people .  he takes particular interest in the cashier at the  " 10 items or less "  lane  ( paz vega )  ,  who he finds an amiable ,  strong ,  and curious presence .   both actors play off each other brilliantly and bring solid dimension to characters in what is a character study .  not a conventional character study ;  they each represent entire worlds .  the cashier's life is mired in a harsh and frustrating  " real world ,  "  while the actor is so enmeshed in his fantasy existence that he can't do simple tasks like remember phone numbers .  he readily admits he's putting on a face when he talks to people ,  and the whole point of researching real people shows he's not one of them .   but not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work ;  we see the reverse process as well .  several characters recognize  " him ,  "  and make reference to how he has inspired them with his movie roles .   the cashier's favorite song  " al pasar la barca ,  "  about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers instead to pay  ( ie :  do honest work )  for boat passage ,  couldn't have been chosen better .  it parallels with the vega character ,  the only store employee with any brains or ambition ,  who is willing to work hard to succeed .   ( that's quite an aspiration ,  for somebody who looks like paz vega .  )  it's an odd little film ,  probably made on a shoestring .  if you don't mind slow pacing and a  " talky "  approach ,  this film will entertain .  the characters are perfectly contrasted ,  and the effective acting makes them endearing .  a nice watch . 
felt mine was while watching this .  .  . but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film .  not that makes a lot of sense anyway ,  as others have mentioned ,  this was one of karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all .  it's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this .  marginally ,  boris did get off slightly better than poor old bela lugosi but not by much .    boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together .  the strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment .  apart from boris ,  the rest of the mexican cast are dubbed into some strange ,  clipped ,  english monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies .    at a guess i think it's edgar allen poe's 'house of usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of poe in the finished article .   still ,  there are far better films out there with boris karloff at his best ,  search them out and give this a wide berth ,  unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too ! 
the actual crime story at the core of in cold blood might seem a little 'tame' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories  ( gein ,  bundy ,  dahmer )  ,  or just the more notorious cases out in hollywood  ( oj ,  manson )  .  the essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted :  perry smith and dick hickock  ( here played by robert blake and scott wilson respectively )  met by some luck ,  conspired to rob a man's farmhouse safe out in kansas ,  and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars .  aside from their returning to the us after fleeing briefly to mexico ,  there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either .  they were caught by some stroke of ironic chance  ( a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after smith and hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change )  ,  and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead .  the story ended in 1965 .   but it's the handling of the story ,  moments of moot ,  the performances ,  a pure cinematic touch that brooks and his absolutely marvelous  ( the late/great )  dp conrad hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white ,  and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama  ( save perhaps for near the end ,  which is pitch perfect )  .  the air of tragedy hangs over the story ,  and not so much because of the killings themselves ,  no matter how brutal they are as the  " third "  man that is conjured up ,  as the narrator observes ,  by smith and hickcock teaming up ,  but because of the inevitability of the story .  you feel somehow for these criminals ,  who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a b-movie .  these aren't good people ,  but they aren't necessarily monsters either ,  at least all the way through .   it's also an excellent 'road-movie' as we see smith and hickcock on the road down to the clutter residence  ( the actual night-time scene of the crime taking place late in the film )  ,  then on to mexico ,  then back to america towards las vegas .  we get to soak in the personalities of these two ,  probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate .  it's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two  ( sort of akin to the aimless quality of malick's badlands characters )  ,  and it's also a sign of daring for the period .  there's no sermonizing ,  like  " he did this because of that and this or the other .  "  we see how smith had an abusive ,  psychotic father ,  but that smith loved and hated him .  the complexity there is too much for the movie ,  maybe even too much for capote's book  ( which ,  i should confess ,  i've still yet to read ,  though i plan to )  .  and we see hickcock is this creature of slick confidence  ( i . e .  getting the suit and other things with bad checks )  ,  but without any deep-rooted explanation to it all .   the streak of fatalism in in cold blood is some of the starkest of the 60s ,  and it's the luck of brooks to have its stars as blake in his top-of-the-pops performance  ( this and lost highway ,  oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years ,  his quintessential pieces of work )  ,  and wilson's breakthrough before becoming a character actor .  while they're surrounded by fine supporting work ,  they themselves are eerily absorbing ,  driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure ,  and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends .  is this a morale of the story ,  if there could be one ,  that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified ,  of good vs evil getting smudged ?  smith apologized for his crime before being hung ,  and he points out ,   " but to who ?  "  this is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true-crime the bonafide chills ,  and it's quite possibly the best american film of 1967 . 
men ,  do i love police movies filled with action ,  shooting ,  chases etcetera .   boy ,  was i let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie .  we've seen it all before ,  the hostages ,  the bank ,  the surrounding .  .  .  yet ,  2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some kevlar .   not just a few shots ,  no ,  hundreds of shots .  going back into the bank ,  where the dumb hostages didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out .  how stupid did the director think we'd be .   okay ,  the shots in between that fake a documentary were good ,  but after seeing the film i only got the thought :  why didn't the police get a decent shooting course ?  and why where there so many cops and was swat on a real long break .  truly bad . 
i have always like this great baseball movie !  it has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites danny glover and christopher lloyd !  also in this movie is ben johnson ,  brenda fricker ,  big tony longo ,  tony danza ,  and matthew mcconaughey !  also jay o .  sanders and dermot mulroney !  the film has great special effects and acting from all of the film's actors !  the baseball scenes are all realistic !  the music by composer randy edelman is very good and it fits the film very well !  some of the actors who reminded me the actual baseball personalities .  stoney jackson's ray mitchell character reminded me royce clayton ,  mcconaughey's character reminded me of steve finley ,  and jay o .  sanders's commentator in my opinion resembled how al hrabosky looks today .  this is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and i strongly recommend this film ! 
the accountant shohei sugiyama  ( kôji yakusho )  is feeling bored with his routine life ,  limited to hard work and stay at home with his wife masako sugiyama  ( hideko hara )  and his teenager's daughter .  one night ,  while traveling home by train ,  he sees the beautiful face of mai kishikawa  ( tamiyo kusakari )  in the balcony of a dance school ,  and a couple of days later ,  he decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dance lessons every wednesdays night .  however ,  he becomes ashamed to tell his family his secret .  meanwhile ,  masako feels the changes in the behavior of her happier husband ,  and hires a private eye to investigate whether shohei is having an affair .   i have just finished watching  " shall we dansu ?  "  and i really loved it .  what a lovely and delightful movie !  the story is amazingly good ,  with drama ,  comedy and romance .  the cast is excellent ,  and i was particularly impressed with the cold beauty and graciousness of the wife of the director masayuki suo and professional ballet dancer tamiyo kusakari .  on last september 06th ,  i saw the american remake of  " shall we dansu ?  "  for the first time ,  and i found it a delightful entertainment .  but now i can say that it is another unnecessary remake ,  and i recommend this original film instead .  my vote is ten .   title  ( brazil )  :   " dança comigo ?  "   (  " dance with me ?  "  ) 
when samantha eggar  ( as phyllis dietrickson )  answers the door of her house swathed in a towel ,  you realize that as competent an actress as eggar may be ,  she doesn't have the hypnotic allure of barbara stanwyck .  and it is not entirely eggar's fault .  in the original film ,  wilder had stanwyck not only appear in a towel ,  but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house .  and she doesn't  " come out "  ;  she appears ,  almost as if by magic .  walter neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor .  there is a reason for this .  stanwyck is much higher than neff  ( fred macmurray )  when they are first introduced .  it is not just the towel .  the towel adds to the seductive allure .  her pose is like a greek goddess overlooking her domain ,  and ,  in a strange way ,  you feel as if ,  from the start ,  she is actually controlling the entire situation .  she has sexual ,  even magic ,  power .  this person is no ordinary housewife .  this person is a mystery with secrets hidden within .   back to 1973 .  the remake has crenna knock on the front door .  stanwyck's stand-in ,  eggar ,  answers the door with a towel around her .  there is no  " appearance "  .  she simply opens the door .  the alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 .  she opens the door with a towel around her .  it may be sexy in a charlie's angels sort of way ,  but it's not nearly as mysterious .  the filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand wilder's point .  the script may have said  " phyllis appears in towel "  so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel .  the point is not the towel .  the point is the enigmatic quality of phyllis ,  and the potential power she wields .  wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique .  the filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that's what wilder did .  and in the choice of shot ,  lost all of phyllis' mystique .   richard crenna also seems miscast .  he seems like he's  " acting "  and not really in the midst of the dilemma .  part of the problem is crenna appears so much like a 70's actor .  he can't get into the 1940's .  when macmurray first speaks into the microphone ,  sweat begins to drip from his face .  no sweat on crenna .  and they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning .  in the original ,  neff says ,   " i didn't get the money ,  and i didn't get the woman .  "  in the 1973 version ,  crenna says ,   " i didn't get the money ,  and i didn't want the woman .  "  did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story ?  or were they dumbing it down for a  " television "  audience ?   this made-for-tv movie is a by-the-numbers rendition .  all the sharp edge of the original is lost .  the only stand-out ,  maybe ,  is lee j .  cobb in the role made famous by edward g .  robinson .  but he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original .  this 1973 boring remake is a forgettable tv-movie made probably by the same people who did  " gilligan's island "  .  they might as well have tried to remake  " citizen kane "  or  " gone with the wind "  .  if mediocrity is the best one can hope for ,  what's the point ?  the 1944 classic is a film with a capital  " f "  .  this made-for-tv remake deserves an  " f "  grade ,  or ,  maybe a  " d "  for dumb . 
i watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all .  it might have been the first episode .  lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station .  all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors ,  but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down .  i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled ,  but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing ,  they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them . 
the neil simon's sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness ,  but the laughter always bitter taste .  seeing willy clark ( matthau )  and al lewis ( burns )  two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue .  willy not ever surrender and continue to look work ,  while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter .  the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony ,  but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel ,  and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between .  now if they would work ,  they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show .  the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions .  the neil simon's screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter matthu ( nomination academy award as best actor )  and george burns ( won the academy award as best support actor )  .  the two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them .  the movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report love-heat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life .  my rate is 7 . 
this really is a great movie .  some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever .  but basically ,  all of fred and ginger's movies are the same .  after the singing and dancing is over ,  it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work .  what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott ?  his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again .  he adds to this movie ,  he doesn't detract from it .  he has a winning personality and a great smile .  randy is in my top ten all time favorites list .  it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy .  ok ,  so he isn't really a great actor ,  but like so many other stars :  errol flynn ,  alan ladd ,  victor mature ,  etc .  he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions .  all of fred and ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers ,  otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour .  i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him . 
if you haven't seen this yet ,  i say just move on ,  take a walk in the park ,  don't waste your time .  neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money .  *spoilers*- i can't decide which was worse :  the movie itself or baldwin's hairstyle ?  ellen pompeo's acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time .  the storyline is just unbelievable .  loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own ?  ?  infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks ?  ?  ?  an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang ?  ?  ?  spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers ?  ?  ?  give me a break .  there's only one good thing about this movie ,  though :  at least ,  the production costs must be lower than  " ocean's 12 " 's which was as meaningless and over the top as this one . 
plot synopsis :  hong kong ,  1966 .  paul wagner ,  the man who built the victoria tunnel ,  is murdered along with his wife by his associates .  his twin sons ,  chad & alex ,  are split apart .  25 years later ,  chad ,  a karate instructor in los angeles ,  & alex ,  a smuggler living in hong kong ,  join forces to avenge their parents' murder & rightfully claim the tunnel .   this is the second time that jean-claude van damme & sheldon lettich have worked together ,  having previously done  " lionheart "  .  this is also the first of three films to feature van damme playing dual roles  (  " maximum risk "  &  " replicant "  are the others )  .  the plot is a very simplistic take on the revenge story ,  the film's sole redeeming feature being van damme's performance as two very different people  the prissy rich kid & the rough-&-tumble ,  cigar chomping tough guy .  as it goes ,  van damme doesn't do a very good job in either role ,  although his take on alex is mildly amusing .  it is puzzling as to have the brothers mistaken for each other ,  with them wearing different clothes & having different hairstyles .  bolo yeung makes a very worthy henchman for the baddies . 
if .  .  .  .  is the cinematic equivalent of sgt .  pepper's :  revered by baby boomers as the pinnacle of creation ,  and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by preceding and subsequent generations .  now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet ,  and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the harry potter books/films ,  the relevance of if .  .  .  .  couldn't be further from modern concern .  in fact ,  many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for pink floyd's the wall .   one should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing ,  and the cemented date of this film aside ,  there are a few flaws which others have overlooked .  lindsay anderson was known to be a fan of luis buñuel ,  on top of generally being too smart for his own good .  and despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts ,  the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod buñuel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism .  anderson wasn't capable of this feat due to his over-intelligent cynicism ,  failing to see that buñuel was jovial in his work .  i have not found a critic whom champions the 'chaplain in a drawer' ,  and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film .  the ending is not so much a concise punch to the established class/values system ,  as a wet slap on a moving target .   the british public school system was firmly for the middle classes  ( the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors )  .  and the modus operandi of if .  .  .  .  was to check the boxes of public school life which lindsay believed had been unexplored in film ,  thereby savaging middle class pretense .  homosexuality ,  generational cutlery ,  cold showers et al .  in reality ,  such issues had been covered in many other great british films ,  if .  .  .  .  merely brought them to the fore .  the browning version was a more oblique damning of such pomp ,  to name but one .   if .  .  .  .  is oddly quaint ,  and simply can not be viewed with modern  ( especially american )  eyes .  kudos to anderson for avoiding mick and kieth in favour of african chant ,  and a few brownie points for the latent homoerotic overtones .  points deducted for pretension ,  establishing characters who disappear ,  and inciting a glib revolution which came to naught . 
the emotional impact of this movie defies words .  it is elegant ,  subtle ,  beautiful ,  and tragic all rolled into two hours .  this is will smith as he matures into his acting ability ,  the full range of it .  who knew ?  i saw the pursuit of happiness and thought ,  this must be a fluke for the blockbuster ,  over-the-top actor ,  smith .  his performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to smith ,  a refinement of talent ,  the selectivity of scripts ,  i'm not sure ,  but i view him differently now .  seven pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief .  don't watch it for the plot ,  watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart ,  both literally and metaphorically .  it is a story of human guilt ,  atonement ,  love ,  and sacrifice . 
if you haven't seen the gong show tv series then you won't like this movie much at all ,  not that knowing the series makes this a great movie .    i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems .   1 )  it's a funny snapshot of the era it was made in ,  the late 1970's and early 1980's .  2 )  you get a lot of funny cameos of people you've seen on the show .  3 )  it's interesting to see chuck  ( the host )  when he isn't doing his on air tv personality .  4 )  you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv show .   i won't list all the bad things because there's a lot of them ,  but here's a few of the most prominent .   1 )  the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length .  2 )  the movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point .  3 )  chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor ,  but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970's flatness .   it's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once .  watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad .  but even then it's not so good either .   ;  ) 
call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series .  if you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series ,  you should definitely watch this one .  perhaps more compelling than that of voyager's caretaker ,  which launched the series with cpt .  janeway ,  archer's adventures are completely different ,  yet strangely familiar .  .  . the music is catchy too .  no true sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode--and these installments make the wait worthwhile . 
the worlds largest inside joke .  the world's largest ,  most exclusive inside joke .   emulating the brash and 'everyman' humor of office space ,  this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books .  the audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary ,  and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist .   the entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time ,  listening to music and writing a novel while working .  these are his goals .  you can't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when  ( around halfway through )  they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria ,  but then gives it up !  the director and screenwriter  ( jacob kornbluth and josh kornbluth )  completely remove the audience's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof .   apart from that major stumbling block ,  the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen .  without these asides ,  the audience wouldn't have noticed anything particularly strange .  humor is only effective if it doesn't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny . 
if i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have  !  i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year  ,  etc etc excuse me  ?  are you ppl snorting lsd or  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ?  there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g  !  i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap .    i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes  ,  i totally understand that  ,  i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once  !    do not watch this movie  ,  do something else useful with your life do the dishes  ,  walk the dog  ,  hell .  .  .  anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod . 
warning :  contains a spoiler .  corny plot and in many cases terrible acting .  fontaine is great ,  but some others ,  particularly richard ney ,  ivy's husband ,  are exceedingly wooden .  ney lies in bed ,  dying of arsenical poisoning ,  with every hair in place .  yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful .  more faithful to the book than most movies of its era .  casting joan fontaine as a poisoner  ( and an adulteress ,  which was just as shocking then - i'm not kidding ,  kids )  was a masterful stroke .  she's just her usual joan fontainey self .  as murderers were supposed to ,  she dies by falling  " feet foremost through the floor into an empty space .

i can not believe such slanted ,  jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material .  early on ,  from such telling lines like  " we want to make sure they are playing for the right team "  and manipulative framing and lighting ,  a love divided shows it's true face .  the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic ,  the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden ,  is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians .  the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story ;  a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves !  it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent ,  so far from attempting art .  this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library . 
sam mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again .  if he does he should be arrested on the spot .  .  . at the very least for petty larceny .  anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated .  this was innocently my first viewing of his  " work "  .  .  . and it will my last .  ed wood looks awfully good to me right now .   when i return this piece of crap to the video store ,  i will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf .  an active supporter of gay cinema ,  i am incensed and angered that this warped ,  exceedingly untalented man-child be allowed to distribute and package something like this ,  with a coltish pretty boy on the cover  ( jamie brett gabel ,  who ,  thankfully ,  has no other acting credits in imdb )  and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait ,  and then market it as a  " movie "  rental .  trust me ,  this has no place being on any rack anywhere ;  it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word .  offensive ,  irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema  ( hell ,  gay rights in general !  )  for those tempting to rent this out because of the cover ,  you will be disappointed .  gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover ,  and he appears once or twice without a shirt -- that's it .  instead ,  the homely mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting ,  sorry-looking dough-boy nakedness .   this  " thing "  he  " assembled "  is a reverse vanity project for mraovich .  both he and his friend michael habousch  ( who ,  i understand ,  puts out similar sleazy garbage )  are terrible in this .  mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no-talent  ( in all fields )  ,  desperate to grab onto any  " loser "  attention he can for himself .  he is to be pitied . 
there are two movie experiences i will always cherish .  the first was seeing  " star wars "  for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother .  a close second is sneaking into halloween at the tripple plex with my good friend ,  trevor ,  in late october 1978 .  halloween left me breathless ,  speechless ,  and downright scared .  everyone knows the story .  young michael myers decides to kill his sister on halloween 1963 .  he escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to haddofield to wreck havoc once again .  he spots laurie  ( jamie lee curtis )  ,  a shy senior who enjoys babysitting ,  and begins stalking her .  her partying friends across the street are killed ,  one-by-one as michael sets his plot to get her .  ironically ,  the young boy she tends on halloween is afraid of the  " boogeman ,  "  and can see him outside .  during the murder spree ,  dr .  sam loomis  ( donald pleasance )  works hard to find michael before he unleashes his fury .  he has no proof ,  no evidence ,  just a hunch he has to sell to sheriff bracket  ( charles cyphers )  .  as the plot unfolds ,  you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare .  alfred hitchcock once said ,   " you can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off .  that is a cheap thrill .  however ,  put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it doesn't go off ,  then you have suspense .  "  director john carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in halloween .  the audience will see glimpses of him outside ,  watching ,  stalking his victims .  we gasp .  will he kill her ?  when will he kill her ?  then ,  michael disappears .  carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore .  this movie has little blood ,  but still provides good scares .  one of the best scenes is michael lifting bob off the ground .  he rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight ,  then he drives it .  all you hear is a loud thud ,  then the audience sees bob's feet drop lifelessly .  carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer .  this also peaks our audience .  what will he do ?  what's going on inside his mind ?  finally ,  carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension .  moreover ,  the tandem screen writing he did with debra hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about .  the teens are not  " party mad ,  "  but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland .  finally ,  there is some decent acting in this  " b ,  "  low-budget thriller .  nick castle who plays  " the shape "   ( michael )  adds something to the mindless killer .  it is cold ,  merciless ,  and without any pathology .  moreover ,  the personality does everything the same way .  he kills only when trapped ,  or to set up a trap .  he splits the victims apart .  he also relies on brute strength .  and that mask used  ( a bleached william shatner mask )  gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion .  while pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues ,  he comes across as someone scared ,  desperate ,  and determined .  it made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil .  the crown jewel ,  though ,  is jamie lee curtis' debut .  she plays the laurie character as someone scared ,  but also determined and strong who fights back .  the end is one that left me speechless .  this was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped .  movies like star wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times .  halloween ,  and other scary movies ,  though ,  do not have that advantage .  so if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new ,  halloween would be the movie i would choose . 
at the beginning of the film we watch may and toots preparing for their trip to london for a visit to their grown children .  one can see toots is not in the best of health ,  but he goes along .  when he dies suddenly ,  may's world ,  begins to spin out of control .   the film directed by roger michell ,  based on a screen play by hanif kureshi ,  is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesn't even know it existed until now .   may's life as a suburban wife was probably boring .  obviously her sexual life was next to nothing .  we get to know she's had a short extra marital affair ,  then nothing at all .  when may loses her husband she can't go back home ,  so instead ,  she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter's home .  it is in this setting that may begins lusting after young and hunky darren ,  her daughter's occasional lover .   darren awakes in may a passion she has not ever known .  may responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes .  may ,  who at the beginning of the film is dowdy ,  suddenly starts dressing up ,  becoming an interesting and attractive woman .  she ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before .   having known a couple of cases similar to this story ,  it came as no surprise to me to watch may's reaction .  her own chance of a normal relationship with bruce ,  a widower ,  ends up frustratingly for may ,  who realizes how great her sex is with darren .  the younger man ,  we figure ,  is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from may .  finally ,  the daughter ,  helen discovers what mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made .   the film is a triumph for the director .  in anne reid ,  mr .  michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of may .  also amazing is daniel craig .  he knows how darren will react to the situation .  anna wilson jones as helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back .  oliver ford davies plays a small part as bruce the older man in helen's class and is quite effective .   the film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind .   
it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this .  it's truly one of the best acted ,  most tightly structured films i've ever seen .  every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways ,  relating to each of the three main characters differently .  the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go .  add to this that the slow-burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that's ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film .  it exposes the romance of movies such as  " titanic "  as the trite cliches they are .  if you're looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry ,  this isn't it .  you have to commit yourself to this film .  you can't have a conversation while running in and out of the room .  this movie demands your attention .  treat it with the respect you deserve and you'll get a lot out of it .  unless you think  " titanic "  is the greatest film ever . 
had i been familiar with the stage production of guys and dolls before seeing the movie ,  i might not be as fond of it as i am .  although in all fairness ,  i would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both brando  ( for his acting )  and sinatra  ( for his voice ,  although he is quite the actor as well ,  see the manchurian candidate or from here to eternity .  )   as for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs ,  i have the broadway soundtrack and though isabel bingley's voice outshines that of jean simmons ,  it is not more pleasant .  i find it to have a rather shrill quality .  jean simmons' voice is much more realistic ,  though admittedly ,  that is not always a huge concern in musicals .  also the only time i particularly noticed marlon brando's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of  " luck be a lady "  and only there because i was previously familiar with sinatra's version .  i also find vivian blaine's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on broadway .  and sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others ,  if they indeed were in need of redemption .   ( they weren't )  it is infinitely better than sam levene's ,  particularly in my favorite song ,  'sue me' .    also ,  the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs ,  i beg to differ .  'a bushel and a peck' is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it ,  'pet me poppa "  and its accompanying performance is more hot box material .  i personally do not care for 'marry the man today' at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie .  i adore 'i've never been in love before' ,  and though it was not sung in the movie ,  the instrumental version can be heard when nathan is in adelaide's dressing room .  the song 'a woman in love'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach .  and the movie wouldn't be the same without the song 'adelaide' ,  not included on broadway .  in fact ,  if the movie soundtrack were available for sale ,  i'd recommend purchasing it instead of the broadway .    though i have not seen the original production ,  i cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors .    the important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so . 
i'm usually not too into a specific show  ( save for the o . c .  & desperate housewives .  .  . hey ,  i am 20 !  )  ,  but ,  no kidding ,  after one episode of reunion i was hooked .   i can't even say how bummed i was that it's time-slot conflicted with bush's speech last night because i was really looking forward to the 1987 episode ,  which will now air next thursday .  again ,  that conflict was disadvantageous because ,  being a new show ,  it needs to build up a following and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentum .   that said ,  tv doesn't always have to be emmy worthy to be enjoyable .  i don't expect reunion to take home any prizes ,  but i do expect it will be able to capture my attention all season .  ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later ?  sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked .  character building takes some time .   the one episode for each year idea is wonderful ,  in my opinion .  the only other show i can recall doing something similar is 24 ,  with each episode being an hour .  .  . and having an eventful year is more realistic than a day that eventful !  please give this show a shot .  relax about art form .  .  . it's just tv ! 
i really enjoyed this .  i got it thinking it was going to be a documentary ,  but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in cheek fun .   i think this has been well done ,  pretty much an extended tv show into a film ,  but due to the characters or rather original actors willingness to have fun and be made fun off helps this work in a great old style innocent way .   if you are a fan of the original tv series then i am sure you will enjoy this .   q
michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems ,  nonetheless ,  to be regarded as a perfect  " catch "  by any woman that runs across him ;  could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film ?  he's a  " hero "  whom it's very difficult to empathize with ,  so the movie is in trouble right from the start .  however ,  it's troubles don't end there .  it has the production values of a tv-movie  ( check out that head made of clay or something ,  near the end )  ,  and the ending cheats in a way that i can't reveal ,  in case anyone wants to see the movie  ( highly unlikely )  .  let's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows .   ( *1/2 ) 
warning !  this review will reveal the ending of the movie ,   " scoop .  "  if you don't want to know how the movie ends ,  don't read this review !    " scoop "  is so bad you'll think  " annie hall "  was a fluke .   it gets one star because you get to see hugh jackman's naked chest .  that's the only thing  " scoop "  has going for it .   woody allen's misogyny ,  and his fixation on women young enough ,  at this point ,  to be his granddaughter ,  has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point .   the plot seems promising :  a ghost ,  ian mcshane ,  directs a fluffy headed student ,  scarlett johansson ,  to investigate whether or not an english lord ,  hugh jackman ,  is the notorious tarot card killer of prostitutes .  a magician ,  woody allen ,  helps the girl .   promising plot notwithstanding ,  the movie completely lacks charm ,  or humor ,  or atmosphere .  it's an amazingly leaden ,  amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film ,  never mind dozens .  perhaps allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press .   much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films ,  woody allen ,  now a septuagenarian ,  has finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl .   not so .  in fact ,  the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one .   there is an early scene where johansson ,  for no reason central to the movie ,  allows herself to be gotten drunk ,  and seduced ,  by a powerful ,  older director .   " seduced "  is a euphemism for what happens .  it's a  " slam ,  bam ,  i've gotta go "  kind of moment .  it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever ,  and it cheapens johansson in the viewer's eye .  why did allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ?  because it shows a powerful director - like allen - having sex with the female lead .  allen gets to have his cake and eat it ,  too .   johansson is not yet an actress .  she doesn't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight ,  low cut top .  she imitates allen in a couple of scenes ,  and that just looks weird and sad .   it doesn't help that her character is scripted as a doll who can't function without a ghost ,  or an elderly and less than awe-inspiring magician ,  telling her what to do at every turn .   she is approximately half jackman's age ,  and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together .   audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines ,  and jackman deserves better ,  too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency ,  and an actress who can convey those qualities .   hugh jackman is similarly cheated by the script .  allen apparently can't stand it that jackman is so stunningly good looking and young ,  and so he gives jackman nothing to say or do .  like johansson ,  he is used merely for his good looks .  this is a shame ,  because ,  as jackman has shown in any number of productions ,  from  " oklahoma "  to  " x men ,  "  he can act .   here's the big plot twist -- jackman ,  suave ,  charming english lord ,  really is a killer .  so ,  though the movie says it is all about letting someone else ,  other than allen ,  get the girl ,  she doesn't get anyone .  jackman ,  the man she's been making love to ,  is a man who murdered a prostitute .  nice ,  woody .  nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp .   in a passive aggressive touch ,  allen deprives his heroine of his own presence ,  as well ,  killing off his character ,  the magician ,  leaving scarlett johansson all alone at the end of the film .   a final note :  at my screening ,  not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film .  always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy . 
sure ,  the history in this movie was  " hollywoodized " --but it's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses .  lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british ,  not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago ;  he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling ,  which caused his sailing to galveston ;  he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero *or* a swashbuckler .  but who cares ?  this is one movie that's sheer entertainment--and face it ,  we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor .  brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance . 
back in my days as an usher  " private lessons "  played at the 4-plex i was working .  it was a sleeper hit selling out friday and saturday nights for several weeks .  i never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend ,  so i decided to give it a shot .  what i witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies i have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch .   the basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid  ( sylvia kristel )  .  she ,  too ,  seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons .  so we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch .  and it goes from there .   eric brown ,  as the teenage boy ,  has to be one of the worst actors i have ever seen .  his  " scared "  reactions to every time sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible .  i didn't laugh a single time during this piece of junk .   and let's not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid .  let's just say it involves faking a death ,  burying a body .  .  .  .  i could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous .   the sex scenes are the worst i have ever seen .  even though eric brown was older then he looked ,  the fact is he looks like a baby .  it appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman  ( if that was acting then maybe i should re-think my criticisms of brown )  and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic .  i have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though miss kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes .   **spoiler warning** i must make mention of the last scene .  to me it's just plain sick but i can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits .  our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers .  he asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if tom cruise has just asked her out .  she nods affirmatively and he walks away ,  smiling at the camera in triumph .  give me a break !  yes i am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid .   i will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982 .  certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office .  and to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country .  that is a scary thought . 
unfortunately ,  the director amos guttman died from aids-related illnesses the year after making this film ,  so we don't know how many more gay-related films we might have had from him .  i found this used dvd ,  from cinevista ,  on amazon ,  but it looks like none of his other works are still available .  hessed mufla  ( amazing grace )  contains full frontal male nudity ,  at least in magazines ,  which turn into a wishful dream sequence .  and some drug use .  this is the story of two families getting by ,  or trying to ,  but the mothers ,  the daughters ,  and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out .  jonathan  ( played by gal hoyberger )  meets up with the next door neighbor thomas ,  who has his own problems ,  of course .  either the translations are a little weak ,  or maybe guttman kept the conversation sparse on purpose ,  for a little mystery .  watching this ,  i get the feeling we're not getting the whole story ,  but that's ok .  throw in a cute gay roommate ex-lover miki  ( aki avni ,  who went on to do many projects ,  mostly isreali tv )  lots of smoking .  lots of worrying by the mothers .  a great blues song  " all night long blues "  done by an unknown female artist ;  if she is listed in the credits , sadly it was not translated to english .  nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect ,  like any other relationship .  but then ,  usa always has been years behind other countries in this way .  a good way to spend 98 minutes .  .  .  i wanted to see even more of it .  won awards at several film festivals ,  acc to imdb and the film jacket . 
all kira reed fans must see this .  the film's premise has struggling romance novelist kira unable to come up with any new ideas .  she's also getting over a divorce .  however ,  she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell  ( and clothing )  .  they go into a corner room and they do it .  thankfully ,  kira gets a condom out  ( now don't ever tell me these playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff .  remember kids ,  safe sex )  .  later ,  she marvels to her publishist how great it was ,  but she didn't get his name .  despite this ,  the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games .  but eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more .  when she does ,  all hell breaks loose ,  and i'll leave it at that .  this is easily the best of these soft-core playboys films i've seen .  check this out ,  and marvel at the greatness of kira . 
massive multiple chills down the spine !  i'm surprised there's people who didn't like it !  i saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff !  and i've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies !  for crying out loud , i'm 22 !  !  !  i mean ,  ok ,  voice acting ,  not particularly good ,  probably even b-movie-ish .  but the genuine look of terror ,  the sound effects ,  the flow !  from the very start ,  hitting you again and again with relentless ,  unforgiving ,  terrorising scenes !  so many clichés yet none fails to surprise/scare !  you know it's coming ,  it's coming ,  it's coming ,  boo !  and you still jump off the chair .  grab a pillow and a blanket ,  call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night !  hats off to the japanese !
