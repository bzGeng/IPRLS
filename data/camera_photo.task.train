0	i bought this for my 8 year old daughter to begin learning about digital photography . it has been nothing but a headache from day one . we have yet to be able to download any pictures . all of the endless number of pictures she has taken have been erased before we can download them . the one button mode is very confusing and the directions although written in english seem to be in a foreign language . the directions say do not return to the store if you are having difficulties . you are suppose to call the phone # , but good luck getting through . i 've tried for 2 days straight . they apparently are experiencing high call volume from all the other unhappy customers who were fooled into buying this `` educational camera '' . as i am shopping for another camera , i will not buy anything from the company who manufactured this camera- sakar
0	we purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera . it took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today 's reasonably priced minidv camcorders . however after six months the lcd screen suddenly stopped working . it was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great . we sent it last november to the panasonic authorized service center . they returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available . we were out $ 100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old . i only share this as a warning to potential buyers . panasonic did not honor our warranty
0	i purchased the 75-300mm for a trip to a nascar nextel cup championship in homestead , fl . i was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning . the lens is not very sharp , feels very cheap , and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light . i packed up and returned the lens about an hour after i got off the plane . i am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture . i suggest you do the same .
0	it takes too long to focus and shoot ! this , coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card , well , it is horrible . people who write in saying they did n't notice the the slow focus and writing , must be either paid by nikon or total nubs . do not buy this camera . it did take decent movies , and the size is nice
1	this is a camera that is very very easy to use . i was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light . i took a movie at my nephew 's theater play and i am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect . the zoom is also very clear and crisp . putting it onto my imovie was also a piece of cake . the only down point is that the still image mode is worthless , but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot . i highly recommend this camer
1	now that i have had this on my camera for a while now , my camera feels so weird with it off , i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to . i wish the buttons were the same plastic/chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain
0	unless you take picture outside , no matter what you do , the picture comes out blurry . flash does n't help at all- it takes more than 5 seconds for it to take a picture , and you still get a blurry picture with horrible quality indoors . my sister had a camera from olympus , with 5 megapixel and 3x zoom too , but i found it so much easier to take a picture ( and a better one too ) with that one . unless you want to buy your 5th grader his/her toy camera , you should n't consider nikon 5600 .
1	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas , and he is absolutely in love with them . the distance it can handle is slightly above average , but the clarity is really where this thing shines . its very easy to use , and has held up reasonably well . i would recomend it to the casual user
1	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras . it fits in the pocket easily . i 'm satisfied
0	do not buy the case canon sells for this camera . it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in
1	very good camera . this was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera . she picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit . directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger . takes some getting used to . zoom lense works great and takes good pictures . where the on-off button is so close to the shutter , you have to be careful that you do n't accidentally shut the camera off . she is very satisfied with it .
1	you can check the photos that i took with canon s45 and this housing . it works brilliant . i just tested in 10meters . also there are supported extra lenses for this housing ( macro , wide ) ..
1	easy to use , including zoom and uploading to computer . nice clear photos when printed out
1	this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer . basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash . it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage . when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed . the white box is for general use . also available are the green omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni-bounce for a warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution for better flash photography . a quality product that works . cons : non
0	the noise problem with this camera is horrendous . do not buy it ! if you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly ... never . no matter how hard you try . my 3-year old 5mpx sony is much better than this panasonic camera . i am sorry i bought it . i would return this product if i could and buy a good camera instead . the lumix dmc-lx2 camera can not focus one bit , many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem . even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred . noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily . you can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness , noise reduction , contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem . the amazon website says you can use standard sd memory which is untrue ( perhaps this has been corrected now ) . the camera only accepts more expensive sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . these sdhc cards can not be read by standard memory stick readers so i have to use the usb port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer .
0	this camera is the worst ! ! ! i bought this on black friday there are many reasons why i am returning this piece of junk : 1.first of all , it runs on double a batteries 2.when i came home i started taking pictures.after i took my first picture , it said error saving image ! 3.then it worked and it didnt work.i tried downloading some of the pictures that were actually saved on the camera onto the computer.when i finished downloading them , i looked for the pics on the computer.i f0und them but the pics were all blurry.i was so fed up that i left it sitting on my computer desk for the next 2 months . do not buy this camera , it will be a waste of your money and time ! i actually thought hp made good cameras ... ..-_-
0	i have had this camera for about a year . it has been nothing but a problem . first , the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems . i have spent hours trying to fix it . still has bugs in it no matter what i do . secondly , the camera is very unreliable . i have a wedding to go to this weekend and i do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too . how do i explain the problems i have had ? there are so many . the camera misfunctions continuously . sometimes it does nothing at all . other times the zoom lense will not shut . you turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option . i sometimes can not even shut the camera off i got ta take the batteries out to do so ... if i can even find batteries that work in the camera . honestly , i call tech supoport and told them the problems i have having and they tell me that only kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some . so i went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries . the camera salesman told me that kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter . i believe him . so my camera which would not work ... i asked the salesman to help me out . it did not work with any lithium batteries ... ..reusable or rechargable . he popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked . well , everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life . my camera now does not work with either batteries . probably only kodak batteries ... .maybe ... .or maybe kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me . i personally do n't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good . really , when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed . i am so anxious to get rid of this camera ... ..well would be but know i got ta fork over at least $ 250 on a good camera . trying to save money on this 'disposable ' camera was a waste . stay away from kodak cameras ! if you do n't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews .
0	the quality is not real hd looking . the footage is jumpy . the camera is terrible in low light . even indoors during the day , you have to blast light into the camera to get a readable image . i returned mine and i 'm looking to getting the much better sony hd cam which is almost double the price , but at least they were smart enough to put a video light on it . being a professional filmmaker and knowing what cameras shoot real hd , i quickly realized that i got ripped off . this may be good only if you 're shooting mostly outdoors during the day , but do n't expect to bring it to a party , club , or out on the town at night . it seems like they should have devoted effort to making the low light shooting excellent . the size of the camera is amazing and the fact that there are no tapes is great . i was really disappointed because i was expecting something better . most digital cameras shoot better video , seriously
1	it is rated for 5 meters but i took it to 9 and there were no sings of moisture or a single drop . the antifogging solution provided works for more than an hour . the microphone records sound well . i have a high def cam and the s.pack did not decrease image quality inside or outside the water . in the specs it is stated that its buoyancy is positive , and by experience i recomend to buy a weight for it to avoid the camera going up in the water while you push and push down - even more snorkeling . there are special weights that are mounted to the enclosure using the trypod whole . i would say a 14-18 onz it fine . it is a great item
0	i bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda . it was ok . felt sort of cheap , but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to . big drawback ... .there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture is n't being shot , so the danger of scratching the lens is immense . my son was so afraid of scratching the lens , that he barely used it . some of the few pictures that he did take were ok , but others were not of the best quality . i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get , and i 'm surprised , because i usually love samsung products
0	poor quality unit . worked sometimes , sometimes not . gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out
1	bought these batteries charger just before going on an overseas trip . i did n't want to be bothered with frequently changing aa batteries , which seemed to last only a day or so of heavy use . i was quite pleased with the performance of these rechargeables . they lasted several days of heavy use before needing to be charged and they re-charged in only a few hours . a big bonus that i did n't expect : the recharger is compatible with european 240 voltage so i did n't have to use an electric converter !
1	i am not a professional photographer . i just happen to be a grandson of one . i use a fully manual canon tx slr for my work . so far i 've shot 5 rolls of this stuff . every time there has been something wrong with the camera/me/lighting . every time i got a usable , and sometimes , great print . this film has a huge exposure latitute ( you can really screw up and still get an image ) when i show these prints to others , they look at me funny and say , this is iso 400 ? it has really fine grain . and because it 's iso 400 , you can use it for almost anything ( i got usable prints after shooting a soccer game : my camera was set at iso 100 and there were light leaks in the camera door ) . it 's a great film , although i 'm told the royal gold it replaces is still better . pick up a pack of this and see what you get . you 'll be amazed
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit . the glass itself was intact , but something underneath was clearly broken . mailed it in to the factory service company for sony , and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost $ 181 to repair . this is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially . i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera .
0	i agree with the previous review . the deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out
0	the night owl optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as i started using it . the system uses high voltage derived from 2-aa bateries . occationally the unit would create a large snap ( arcing noise ) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece . if one is using the instrument , the light actually hurts the eye . i have returned the monocular to night owl for repairs . i do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit . they told me to ship it at my expense . another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours . other than the above , the monocular has performed well . epilogue-night owl optics did repair the unit and returned it .
0	this case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses , briefcases or luggage . but do n't count on it to protect your camera from falls , dirt or dust . it looks good , the powershot logo gives an authentic look to it
1	excelent battery ! i recommend it for all olympus slr digital cameras . i am using it on my e300 and you can take a lot of pictures in one day . i have 2 batteries because of outdoors shoots and this is really enough .
1	slightly smaller than the charger that comes with the s ( 40,45,50 , ... ) series cameras and the digital rebel series cameras . seems to charge in about the same time . feels a bit more substantial , but that 's not saying much as the chargers that come with those cameras seem pretty flimsy . i ca n't give it 5 stars because it does nothing more than the chargers that come with the cameras ( which i lost )
1	i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it . first of all is 's very easy to operate with the joystick , the use in the still image function is allways available , even while shooting a video ( nice feature but as all camcorders - low quality pitures ) the stabalizer ( one of the reason why i 'd preffered that cam over the other ) is great and even in full zoom you can get pretty steady videos . the large zoom ( x32 ) is also very nice . overall i think this is great value for my money ... .
0	tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d-524 camera . turned out to be a downgrade . did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts . it would die a sudden death -- no low battery warnings before the camera shut down . i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts . the cr-v3 now gathers dust . it did not even improve the flash recycle time . just a waste
1	i am only an amateur photographer , but still . . . this small camera with the long nose gives performance one might expect from an slr film camer costing a lot more , and a lot more complicated to use . i caught the digital bug sevearl years ago . my latest before this beauty was a simple little canon sureshot 3mp . a great camera , but this camera has the same simplicity , but takes pictures which are much more refined in terms of sharpeness for not much more than i paid for that camera four years ago ! ! this panasonic lumix has a leica lens , which can ' t be matched by any other camera but it 's twin leica camera -- a much more expensive piece of equipment . the long lens might put you off if you are an average family photog , but if you want an all around 35mm-12x camera without a huge heavy expensive bag of lenses , like me , this baby is for you . it only looks massive . it is quite lite and manageable . i use it for bird photographsy , but it could be great for any situation where you need to get really close up in just about any lighting situation with ultra-fine resolution . do n't want to spend mega bucks for a mega-camera ? this is the answer . i love it , and i think your will , too . easy to use , and easy on the wallet . if you 're not quite there , try the next model down , with the same focal length but 6 mp , for a couple hundred less . another terrific buy . no , i do n't work for panasanic . i 'm a retired print editor . jim isha
1	i 've had this lens for 2 months now , and love it . it was my first `` l '' lens and i can see the quality difference in this line . first , i tried the 28-135 is-pretty good . but i was n't totally happy , so returned it and ordered the 24-105 l. now i 'm happy . contrast , sharpness , ca are much better . build quality feel are superior as well . plus the is really works . i will try get all is lens in the future , i believe it is worth the extra cost . focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth steady . if you 're on a budget , the 28-135 is real nice . but to go all the way , i recommend this lens . the is on the 24-105 l is quieter i found . the price is a bit steep , but optical quality is there , resale value will remain good , and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens .
1	the controls on this camera are not hard to figure out.it is fun to have all the little things you can do with the pictures and being 12 almost 13 , photogerphy is somthing i love to do with this camera.if you think this camera is to complicated , well you didnt read the instruction guide very well
1	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas , and he is absolutely in love with them . the distance it can handle is slightly above average , but the clarity is really where this thing shines . its very easy to use , and has held up reasonably well . i would recomend it to the casual user
0	i have just bought the sony cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and i have only taken 30-40 pictures , i loved it and then it just stopped working , so i recharged the baterry , no luck still the camera would n't turn off or on . so thankfully i had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again . no it does n't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off . basically worthless . it seems like it might have short circuited . but i was so excitted to buy this camera i read all instructions before use , i have n't let anyone else use it and it has n't been out of my sight , never been dropped , never in extreme hot or cold , always well protected . so i am going to try to return it or exchange it . i am hoping to get good service or i will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures . hopefully i can let you know if they stand by their products . before now i have always been happy with what i have bought from amazo
0	the nikon camera s3 is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture . it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk .
0	i purchased the 8 x 10 photo frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter . i was able to get the product running and to load a 'test ' set of pictures , but the product then 'froze ' at the startup screen . i checked the pacific digital support website , which provided steps ( basically , a sequence of buttons to hold down ) to 'unfreeze ' and reinitialize the unit . i tried this sequence several times , to no avail , and then called pacific digital customer service . after repeated messages left on a voice mail system ( `` we 're sorry we missed your call - we 'll get back to you '' ) at all times of the day and night , i was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned . long story short - our wedding came and went , the problem was never ( and will apparently never be ) resolved , and the digital photo frame is now a $ 390 paperweight . absolutely useless . my recommendation : do not purchase a pacific digital product . this is clearly a fly-by-night outfit
0	as i watch the videos of my kids on my 50 '' plasma , 32 '' lcd and mac , trying to convince myself that i like the quality , my wife walks by and says , `` fuzzy . '' i know most guys out there will know what i 'm talking about - she just killed the deal . regardless of the specs , the wives do n't lie - the picture quality just does n't cut it . it 's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old sony dvr . the product design is cool , the price is good , the sd card recording idea is perfect , but the hd promise does n't come close to paying off . if you 're looking for sharp , crystal clear images - you 're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle .
0	downside : 1 . i 'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem . the camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems . i switched batteries ... let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it ... nothing is getting it to work . on top of that i now have a memory card with photos on it that i ca n't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that . 2 . not good with indoors pictures especially if you try the `` night '' mode . if you use that mode , even with a tripod , keep your subjects to still-lifes , only ... if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest , they will at best be blurry , at worst they will look like double exposures . 3 . indoors pictures set at normal mode , with or without flash , are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera . upside : 1 . through its usb cable , it booted right into apple 's iphoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that i took a breeze . 2 . outdoors , with plenty of sunlight , gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise . kodak did well with this aspect of the camera 's ability , given the price . 3 . we won this camera ( free ) so for me it 's almost all upside ... except now i have to shell out $ $ $ for a good camera ( that will hopefully read my current memory card
0	this is a good charger - quick and portable . but the battery life of the battery sucks !
0	after reading the great reviews regarding the vct870rm tripod ( here and elsewhere ) , i decided to purchase one for my sony hdr-hc1 camcorder . when i first opened the box , the vct870rm seemed sturdy and well made . the tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch , and the remote controls on the handle worked well . however , the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan , the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly . it felt like the tension control knob was tightened , but that was not the case . in fact , the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed . i recently found a vct870rm review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning . however , due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod , i 'm assuming that i just received a bad one . i 'm now in the process of working with amazon to get a replacement sent to me . so far , amazon has been great , as they 've already scheduled ups to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day . they say that i 'll receive my new tripod next week . i 'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives . update : i received a new replacement vct870rm tripod from amazon , and this one works great . panning and tilting are both very smooth , and the tension is adjustable . if i 'd have received this tripod originally , i would 've given it 5 stars . the first vct870rm i received was definitely defective . i 'm glad i returned it , and i 'm glad i bought it through amazon ( best price at the time , and a hassle-free return )
1	to all , i just purchased the sp-550uz after searching for the best camera bang for the buck - olympus fills the bill ... .. 3/3/07 was my first day of use and i decided to check all the features - with the batteries supplied - still in use and a 2gb card - i took off for the outdoors and began shooting pictures at a local park - 300 pictures - including several 15 fps and 30 fps shoots and three videos - 15 , 30 and 45 seconds in length . i am not a pro and will be using this camera for sports , vacations and every day family events . no cons yets - i love the `` scn '' feature - just select how you want to take the picture and the camera setups the camera - all you have to do is take the picture
0	i have had this camera since jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings . do n't expect much from it and you will be happy . as an entry level dslr it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions . i find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light , provided that they are not moving . cons : in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well . battery dies fast . the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting , especially when shooting in raw mode . i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode ( approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge ( over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day . i can not tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike . so i always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . the viewfinder is very dim . when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d , it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d 's viewfinder . in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap , especially when having to resort to manual focus . autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible . when shooting indoors , the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject . i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur . this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus . the 420ex flash is supposed to `` talk '' to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed . however , with the 300d , this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed . after about five months , the shutter button started sticking . i would click it and then it would remain depressed . the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little . another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button . and since there is only one thumbwheel , it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed . for example , if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature , then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel . when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera , this is a real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you are a casual point and shoot person , it 's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos . but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately , look elsewhere
1	very good rechargable battery pack.holds charge for a long time even if camera is not used much . capable of taking many shots with plenty of review time . very pleased with it
1	the bushnell perma focus 7x50 wide angle binoculars were the ideal choice for my recent trip to tanzania and the serengeti . they worked perfectly for the application needed . a really happy surprise on just how well these worked . as we bounced around on dirt roads and cross country in land rovers , the perma focus feature was outstanding and made things simple and easy ! : - ) the magnification level was perfect for almost every scenario we came across . anything that was outside of about 80 feet came through in crystal clear vivid color and clarity . it really made for up close and personal viewing of all the animals we saw . by far , these were the best investment i made before the trip ! i ca n't imagine being without them now on such an expedition . really fantastic performance and a great value to boot ! ! ! ! the vendor was fast flawless in the transaction too . in my opinion you wo n't be disappointed with these binoculars . troy : - )
0	i bought this bag looking at the display on amazon . but compare to price i paid this bag is not atall good . size is small , extra pockets are useless , where you cant keep much . camera pocket is also not convenient . only plus point is quality of material used .
1	i bought this for my mother-in-law who is in her 80s and set it up for her . it 's quite easy if you 're already computer literate , and the controls are very user friendly as well . the software could use a few tweaks to make it not look so basic , but for someone like my mother-in-law , it works well . wish i had a docking station for my nikon .
1	every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it . pretty infuriating , especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it . yes , you can always remove those on photoshop ( or cheaper yet , the gimp ) ; but is n't it cool when you look at a picture and say : `` that is it , nothing to do on it ! '' ? ? and it was n't just the sky . any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks . with this blower , greatly priced ( pity that adorama does n't have free shipping though ) , i put my camera on the tripod , pointed it down , squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs ! ! ! great buy for dslr owners
1	product is working good and clarity is fine . but i found the next version product ( with remote ) cost lower than this product .
1	this is my first digital camera . prior to this i had a simple kodak point-and-click model which pretty much the quality of a disposible . i use much higher grade cameras at work both 35mm and digital . this camera gives you the 5.1 mp ability though most shots only require the 3mp . i like the 32mb internal memory though i 've also bought a 256mb card for traveling . the 5x zoom is n't as cool as i initially thought it would be and digital zoom works sometimes and not others but you must understand what digital zoom really is . the camera takes very clear and optimal pictures . better pictures then i 've taken on anything else i 've owned before ( and some of the work cameras as well ) . the size is small enough to put in your pocket but not too small for one with larger hands . the different flash options and shooting scenes can turn difficult pictures into what you want to capture . the panoramic shot sequence is an especially favorite feature especially for shoreline shots . i 've also bought the r-series dock and enjoy its ability to transfer my pictures faster and charge two batteries at once . this camera is worth the price you pay but i believe its a 2005 model so it may not be the most up to date but it does a great job .
1	solidly built , this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier sony cybershots like the dsc-r1 . the remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake , which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified ( high optical zoom , supressed flash , etc ) . what surprises me is the fact that the shuttle release button on the remote works exactly the same as any sony cybershot : press halfway to focus , and all the way down to capture the shot . the zooming buttons do not work for the sony dsc-r1 as the camera has a manual zooming ring , but they should work fine with any other cybershot that comes with an electronic zoom and of course , an acc terminal . highly recommended .
1	good product , like the price . this is much less expensive than the current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it on ebay used for $ 150 so you may be able to find it for less ( look under hunting and golf rangefinders for this model ) . this does not have the pinseeker feature of the newer models but normal mode and scan mode work perfectly for ranging flags that have no reflectors ( although you may need to try more than one time and have relatively stable hands ) . i was able to range a flag at 270 yards , and was able to range the top of a telephone pole at 375 yards ( but it was windy so the flag was straight out and a little cloudy ) . i would estimate that this will work for ranging flags on a calm sunny day ( these do n't work as well on a sunny day because the laser used is a visible light laser and gets a little interference from sunlight ) at 215-230 yards for a flag ( which is what i need it for ) . less expensive alternative than the pinseeker , and i really like the performance , very impressed .
1	this is the perfect camera for me . i take alot of close-up detail shots and the images come out great . it is smaller than my old g3 ( which i loved , but was pretty chunky )
1	the cover over the lense broke/small lcd screen/ pictures are pritty good/battery life is pritty good/some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady/takes nice portaits/ easy to use/ has a veiw-finder
0	after doing a bunch of research , i bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective sony ccd that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had . the first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations . after a few days of that , the camera dies completely . the second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease . one camera . . . a fluke maybe . but two ? that suggests a real problem so beware .
1	this is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish . there are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber . i have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it . i use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography . the quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release . i bought an extra quick release plate so i can switch between two cameras . tilt only -- no swivel : amazon ( and others including bogen ) calls it a swivel tilt head , but that seems to imply that it moves in two directions -- tilting ( up and down ) and swivelling ( side to side or panning ) . this head only moves in the tilting direction which allows you to orient the camera in either landscape or portrait modes . the tilting action could be improved if the head clicked into the upright position when you tilt it back to landscape . when you are going to the portrait mode , there 's no problem since it stops at 90 degrees . however , when i want to go back to landscape , i have to hold it out and look at it to see if it 's level . a subtle click to know i 'm there would be nice
0	i have known canon to be a very high quality company . however , i was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations i had about this camera . a few years ago i bought the fujiffilm 3800 . i loved this camera but after a few ski trips i found it rather bulky . i then bought the canon s500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the s400 . for most of the pictures i take on a ski trip this camera is fine . however , if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime , this camera is worse than a disposable camera . first , there is no red-eye reduction . it simply does not work when i set it to take flash with red-eye reduction . second , pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry . i would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod . third , night picture ? ... .forget about it . i tried to get a beatiful picture of the chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed . so , i tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and i could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures . looks like i 'll be back in the market for a fujifilm . after all the reviews i 've read , i 'm waiting for the other shoe to drop ( e18 , lcd , etc. ) . not to mention the terrible service that i have been reading about
0	this backpack was very uncomfortable . the inserts are stiff . it does n't represent canon quality ( i hope )
0	the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2 . of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100 % ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too
0	i too , loved the camera , despite the small lcd screen size , until it got the infamous white screen of death that this particular camera is known for , which usually occurs after the warranty expires ( 1 year ) . photos outside are great , poor low-light photos though , but i paid $ 100 for it ( and with $ 20 coupon it was $ 80 ) . small lcd screen means that it takes less battery power , so the rechargeable aa batteries lasted a long time . white screen of death temporary solution : turn the camera off , and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the `` cybershot '' logo on the front of the camera . then turn it back on . repeat if necessary . it 'll probably happen again , but it beats buying a brand new camera if you 're on vacation and do n't have time to bargain shop
1	this was the best item i ever bought for my camera . i do a lot of walking with my camera , and thought i would use it as a walking stick , which i do , but the best part of this monopod is what i never thought would happen . my pictures are never fuzzy ! i can take low light photos and have they come out clear . i paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera . the three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths . the carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched
1	these binoculars provide a good tool for night time sky viewing . easier to carry than a telescope with the advantage of using both eyes . the tripod mount can be used with most any tripod with a standard screw mount . the 15 power makes hand holding a challenge but with practice they work great .
0	this product link needs to be corrected , as the battery contained in the kit is not the same battery which is used in the dcr-dvd7 . do not purchase this accesory kit if you intend to use it for the dcr-dvd7 camera .
0	i 've just returned this unit . it does n't play videos as advertised . i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution ... see other review below . but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture . at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken ... .more later . i have now had 3 different brands of 8 '' photo frames in my possession : a phillips , a pandigital , and this coby . i have developed the following list of features in my `` ideal '' photo frame . first , video playback : i 've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera ... they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along , and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive . i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking ( .mov , more later ) i 'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show ... that is , to play movie clips in show presentations , intermixed with .jpg photo files . second feature is to play .wma music files , in addition to mp3 . this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player . all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3 . third , i would like a timer on my frame ... set it to come on in the morning , off at night , for example . fourth , i 'd like an audio or speaker out feature . none of these frames has home theater-like sound , and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i 'd probably hook up . video out could come in handy too . fifth , i 'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame 's software , manually or automatically . yes , you can rotate them in the computer , but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation . ( this may depend on which photo edit program you are using . ) sixth , i 'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame 's software . especially with the huge chips now available , i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here is where the 3 units i 've had stack up , followed by my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping the pandigital ... .which costco has for $ 140 . it plays .mov video files , but not within a slideshow . it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock/timer . no ability to play stills/video intermixed . i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok . the phillips did n't play video , and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere . ( no remote and no music with the philips either . ) the coby wo n't play my videos , even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations . the coby plays .wma music files , wo n't rotate stills , has no folder system , no clock/timer . it has a speaker out jack . it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show . picture quality is fully equal to philips , generally the recognized standard . if all you want is photos , and never turn your camera sideways , this unit will be a good value . another unit i 'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci . i 've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos .
1	okay , i am new to the world of stargazing . i purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at amazon.com . i have been completely satisfied . i am especially impressed with the clear , crisp viewing of the moon . i can see a few planets , but they are of course very small through the eyepiece . i do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope . take your time putting it together . read all the directions first . pay special attention to the details concerning the collimator . if you do n't know what that is , you need to . i almsot made some major mistakes , screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone . if you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions , you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself , especially on a clear night . the package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact . i could n't be happier with my purchase . i am sure a more avid sky-watcher might want a little something more , but for the once-in-a-while gazer , this is the telescope . see ya next review .
1	this is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier canon digital elph that i lost several years ago . the 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures . in fact the digital zoom also works great - just make sure the camera is steady ( i purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome ) . although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have , you ca n't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes . the canon sd500 is a great little camera
0	this frame is just ok you have to resize all your pictures and the quality is not good at all you are just better off paying the extra $ 75 and getting the phillip
1	my fuji e900 fits perfectly and also the battery charger and extra batteries . the front pocket for additional memory cards is a great idea . case goes on belt or on neck strap to accomodate personal taste . very nice and reasonably priced
1	we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism . naturally , only time will tell if this is any different , but in the meantime , here 's what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket . much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i 've owned , thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere . the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n't need me to tell you this , right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it does not appear very clear , especially if the subject is not static . however , it is bright and rich in color . 3 ) infolithium - this is sony 's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately , of course . if use is consistent , will provide you with a good idea . if you use one function then another then another , it tends to vary much more and is not as useful . 4 ) integrated charger/usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer . minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger , though the bright white color is far from a match . the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera can not focus on objects that are relatively close to it . i am not speaking about macros , but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small , near objects , such as coins , stamps , or text . quick focus on objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive , but the fact that you can not just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice . i do n't know if the battery is universal , but even if it is , it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony 's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard , but this camera uses the memorystick duo , which is about 1/4 or so smaller than the `` regular '' memorystick . this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless , as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny , thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark . within a few feet is okay , but farther subjects are not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures , meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate . you can certainly take pictures in bursts , but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick . previewing the images is also slow . this is also disappointing , as it 's not faster than my older p52 . 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod , you have to mount the camera on the plastic station , then connect the tripod to the plastic dock . this is far from ideal . well , there you have it . the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you , in which case this could be a great value for you . i am certainly happy with it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards , compatibilities , and dubious long-term quality
0	i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera . in the end , it came down to panasonic 's fx01 and cannon 's sd600 . i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic 's images were n't top quality , but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600 . i was wrong . after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera to be great , but it just was n't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera to amazon ( very easy-great service ) because of the poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs is why you take photos , right ? i know someone with the sd600 and he 's very happy with the quality . judging by the customer images on the sd600 's page on amazon , i think i should 've gone with cannon
0	this is the first digital camera that i have owned . overall i am generally satisfied with the quality of the pictures it produces . however , there are a few things that , if i had known beforehand , would have prevented me from purchasing this camera . 1 ) camera is not plug-and-play ( even if they say it is ) . you have to install the kodak easyshare software to download pictures . this is a huge negative . in the future , i will only buy cameras that show up as removable storage drives when plugged into a computer . 2 ) video is stored in apple quicktime format ( *.mov ) . the is also a huge negative . the codecs for this format are not widely available for application integration . you have to download and use apple quicktime to view them . you can not view the videos in windows media player . it is also not compatible with some photo-album software . i would only buy cameras in the future that have an option to store video in a non-proprietary format . update : after review , i have found that winxp and vista plug-n-play with the camera when it is plugged into the usb port . it does not work on win2k . thanks for the comment that made me double-check
1	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work . when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with . unless you are going for a very shadowy , high-contrast , image this diffuser can save the day . it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places , so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind . sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo , and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences
0	i own many sony products , including a sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed by this camera , the sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present . it is small , lightweight , portable ; easy to use ; and stylish . it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months of use , a few problems have become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there is horrible red-eye ( and white-eye ) artifact in many pictures . the so-called `` red-eye reduction '' setting does nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography is very grainy , with lots of noise . night-time photography is impossible . these problems are not unique to our camera ... you will find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed in this camera , and wish i could exchange it for something else . do not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( and they are still small pocket-size cameras ) .
0	i have to say i am very disappointed with this camera . i had really high hopes for this one . i waited for the hd2 to come out and when i saw a lot of positive reviews i bought one , i should have waited . for sanyo to call this an hd camera does n't make sense . the picture has more grain and noise then my old high 8 camera . outdoors in bright light the camera is ok . low-light is horrible pros : - nice form factor , love the look and feel and it 's so tiny it fits in your pocket . very portable and something you can take anywhere . - secure digital cards are great , can transfer and edit on the computer quickly - still pictures are pretty good . although still digital cameras are better . - hdmi output can plug directly into your hdtv ( although if you are used to watching things in hd you will be disappointed ) cons : - indoor and low light situations very grainy , even with the high sensitivity button . - do n't attempt to take still shots while you are filming , it works but when you watch the film you hear loud noises and the shot pauses for 2 or 3 seconds and then continues . very cheesy . - you can hear the data being written to the secured digital card on the video which is annoying . i thought sd was supposed to minimize noise . - watching the playback of movement with this makes me dizzy , not even fast movement either . - image stabilization is not that great either compared to other cameras i have used . - audio sounds a bit tinny in my opinion this camera is geared for portability and being able to capture moments quickly as this is something you can always carry with you . if you are n't too concerned with quality picture it 's probably fine . i really think sanyo has a great concept and one day this could be the end all be all device . for now it should come with a warning of it 's limitations . i am not saying it 's total garbage , but if you have high hopes like i did , you will be disappointed .
1	i gave this as an xmas gift to my 14-yr-old daughter and she loves it . super easy to use . good idea to get a backup battery if you 're like her and forget to charge it sometimes . big selling bonus was that it was thin enough to fit into her pocket
0	the magnetic clasp is weak very weak - making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it 's own . i keep this camera case inside of my purse . i would n't recommend this product there has to be something better
0	as the previous reviewer pointed out , this is not the klic-5001 1700 mah battery as described in the product details , it is the lower capacity ( 1050 mah ) klic-5000 . at least it is the kodak battery , if that matters to you . ( i have a new kodak camera and want to protect the warranty . ) if not , plenty of places sell the generic klic-5001 for less than amazon sells the kodak klic-5000
0	we returned this item . it was a glorified external dvd burner . it was not worth the money
1	i love my new canon a710 . large lcd makes taking pictures easy to frame , color and sharpness is good all around and needing only 2 aa batteries is great . i no longer need to search and buy special camera batteries , i can go into any drug store . only draw back on this camera is the size of the memory card 16mb . for a few bucks more put in at least a 1gig . overall rating for a camera in this price range - above average
1	i have been using this lens for about 2.5 years and it is an exceptional piece of equipment , especially for the price ! i very rarely feel the need to get a closer image than i can achieve with this lens . it 's very solidly built and i am sure it will continue to be a primary piece in my kit for years to come
1	this camera does everything it says ; yes , it 's waterproof and i was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time ! ! only reason i did n't give it 5 stars : it is as slow as every other digital camera i 've owned as far as focusing , multiple flashes , and then actually shooting . you get your subject 's attention and they smile , frozen , as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken ( in low light . ) i was especially intrigued by its `` bright capture '' technology , but it honestly does n't seem any different in low light than my old sony u20 2mp tiny little snapshot camera . still that same flash-in-the-dark look . there is a fill-flash low light program mode ( among many many others ) , but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob , even if you hold your breath and try to remain still . my ideal snapshot camera is portable , durable , quick , easy , and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes . this camera has 3.5 out of those 5 . it is way portable , very durable , easy , produces ok results but you have to mess with settings if you 're not in daylight , and it 's not very quick . overall i am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere
1	it was everything it was reported to be . it works very well . we take it on every trip we take
1	the previous review is not completely correct . the problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon.com put up for the canon cpm-e3 battery magazine . it is a battery magazine for the canon compact battery pack cp-e3 and not for the camera battery grip . i think the product itself is a great thing , it lets you switch the whole magazine with 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the canon compact battery pack cp-e3 . the previous reviewer should not judge a product by the incorrect infromation given by a retailer
0	amazon 's aggressive marketing tacticts now include shipping you goods when you called them to cancel it . i will never buy from amazon again . i bought over 100 items over 5 years . i purchased the camera on a 1 day delivery plan . they then just ship 4-5 day completely insensitive to a photographer 's needs . i cancelled order 2 days before it ships , they say sorry we can not cancel . 2 days ? ? ? come-on . i guess the $ 3000 just creates nice interest . the end for me and amazon , i do not like this kind of `` aggressive marketing '' . good advice , rather buy direct from b photo , pay double if you like , but you will get what you pay for there , not aggressive marketing and shoving of a product down your throat at their terms . i am truly annoyed . run , hide .
0	i got this telescope for my desk at work because i have a decent view . it stinks , i think i can see better with my naked eye . plus you can not focus it because the slider is so stiff . i guess i will be buying another telescope now
0	i purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last march . i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support . they went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up . well i followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been . so they said i should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it . then i sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there . they sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing . well i just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem . they never fixed the problem . mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son 's life before the age of 2 . i called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor . she said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera . well i was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late august a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera , but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped . she said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera . i told i have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before i sent it in the first time . i started to cry that my son 's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when i got off the phone . the camera is worse than a disposable camera . do n't waste your time or money on this piece of junk . i recommend olympus . my olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk . i am planning on contacting the better business bureau regarding this matter . please do n't waste your time on this , like i have to ! i hope this helps people make better choices ! good luck ! i wish someone could have forecasted this for me
0	review : unit had a very large defect in the field of view . it 's not one of the usual spots from the intensifier tube ; those i am aware of as i have other night vision devices . this goes about 1/4 of the way across , near the center . had to return it . poor quality control . update - the new one does not have any image defects . it also does n't focus as sharply as the first one did ( or my other one does ) , but it is n't too bad
0	yes , i have to agree with the previous review . it does n't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources . it does n't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything . if it was less expensive i would n't mind as much , and just chalk it up to extra protection . but that seems to be all it 's good for
1	this digital photo frame has reasonably good picture quality and once set up , can be used by anyone in the selected mode . i have it set for slide presentation mode and people enjoy looking at it . i could easily see giving it , already set up , to people who are not computer savvy , such as grandparents . to give them new pictures , send a new card and they slip that in . that said , the cost is still fairly high and the buttons on the top of the frame useless unless you have them memorized or really good vision . i would recommend this product
1	i started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability . having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap , this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least , is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself , allowing full ease of rotation of the camera . though i have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of aa batteries , having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and i am in the heat of shooting . i always travel with my charge and four aa batteries . i would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the eos-20d and eos 30-d. one thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases .
0	my ownership of this camera was brief . first , you must know i love nikon . i have 2 other nikons -- an old cooplix 2200 and a coolpix 5700 . they have wonderful lenses and give great pix . i thought my experience with this model would be similar . not ! ~ from picture numero uno , the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate . i got pictures , yes , but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens . what a dissappointment ! i traded it in for a canon a520 and am happy with that camera . i suppose it is just what it is . if i 'd saved and spent a lot more money on a d50 or rebel , who knows ? anyway , that is my sad tale with the nikon 4800
1	i went to ritz camera today and took a good look at the tz3 . i 'll tell you , its pretty nice . the build quality is really good , as a previous person mentioned . the body is metal . the dials and buttons click with precision , and have a nice resistance . it has a nice weight to it . i took some nice shots in the store . i must have clicked off 100 pics . i 'm impressed with it . if you want something relatively small , powerful and tough , this camera is for you . the 10x zoom is great , but on such a small camera it is difficult to hold it steady enough ( at least for me ) to use the zoom too much . i love the build quality and style , so i may be biased . it 's a nice piece of equipment . i can not speak to the photo quality only having seen pics on the camera 's lcd
0	just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted . never used . returned it
0	for average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this . i do n't know about the specifics , but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months . so , i do n't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it does n't even take a picture . it was fine while it worked , it ate batteries but the pics were good
0	do n't let the product description fool you into thinking it will work with a zr85mc camcorder . it did n't work with mine . it did n't even fit
0	the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over . i brought them home and there is fog inside . also inside is some dark crap that you can not get to ... and it is on the lens . i called bushnell 's help line and they told me ... '' well , it is n't internally fog proof , just externally '' when asked about the stuff on the inside . `` that is probably fungus , that sometimes happens '' i just bought the binoculars ! ! ! he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out . avoid these at all costs ! ! ! they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
1	i 'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power . it 's compact , not heavy , has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right . in addition to the light output , the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced , an excellent feature . getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because i am totally `` brochure reading averse . '' twenty years ago i was a photographer with big equipment , but had given up both . i was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit
0	i have one word for the argus quick clix , horrible . i bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for christmas . the camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them . i was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use . this camera takes horrible pictures . all of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy . when the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject . one very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off . there is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash . you have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use . as stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture , it is so bright that the picture is useless . i would not recommend this camera to anyone
0	i was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera . i had hoped the ultra-wide photos ( which was my main reason for going with this camera ) also would be ultra sharp , but instead they tended to be soft . the camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second , so it 's more of a point , shoot and wait camera . the v705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints , but do n't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras . in my opinion , the camera squeezes too much out of a jpeg photo by way of compression and shooting tif files just is n't practical . i demand better image quality from my cameras and , when zooming in , i like to see detail . i certainly do n't like everything going soft .
0	i bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock . money thrown away ! ! the camera does n't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk , also in my opinion . it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it , i threw it on the floor and smashed it . not kidding ! when i first got it , i called kodak and they told my son ( who is knowledgeable in this stuff ) how to reset the printer . we reset it and it worked for awhile . then it would n't work any more and i did away with it . no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked
0	i bought this from another retailer on `` black friday '' for half of what amazon is selling it for and i 'm still bringing it back . i think it 's horrible . i was so excited to get a mini-dv camcorder because i heard how great the picture was , but this takes horrible video . it comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything , even using the light . even in a fairly well-lit room it came out dark . it looked ok on the lcd screen , but when i hooked it up to the tv , horrible ! and it 's not my tv either because i hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine . i love that it 's so small , but if i ca n't see the video , it 's no use to me . back to by big old sony
0	so i saw that this product got 5 stars , so i ordered it ... ... when i got it , its like `` um ... is that it ? ? ? '' it 's really cute , and really well made , but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards ... also , there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it , also , the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all ... other than that , it 's cute , but not the best out there .
0	straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality . plug into wall and does not work . after trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord , it finally powered on . after putting in a card , the pics were ok , passable . the mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more , and i was only playing very quiet jazz . this is not worth the money even though it is cheap . pay a little more and get one that is of better quality
1	i do n't think anybody is going to pretend that the little casio exilim ex-z600 6.0 mega pixel camera is the best camera ever built or takes the best pictures in the world . but for under $ [ ... ] , it 's hard to beat and does everything advertised . the size is perfect , one of the smallest , slimmest cameras made , easily fitting into one 's [ ... ] pocket , even when enclosed in a small case . the viewing screen is probably the biggest and brightest you 'll find , so aiming and shooting is easy as it can be . the range of modifications ( size , contrast , sharpness , saturation , etc . ) to taking and managing pictures seems almost endless , yet the various menus the camera offers are simple to navigate . and the camera 's docking stand makes downloading pictures to one 's computer as well as charging up the camera a snap . moreover , according to casio , a single charge will afford one up to 500 or more snaps . picture quality ? it 's perhaps not as absolutely clear and well defined , even at its maximum six mega pixels , as the best cameras ; although , to be fair , the best cameras often cost three-to-four times as much as this one . so , as far as i 'm concerned , i 've no complaints , and the pictures i 've been taking are a delight to the eye . the z600 makes picture-taking fun again
0	so this was my first digital camera , got it last july for my birthday . i go to a lot of concerts , so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects . well , two days after i got it , i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white . it would still take pics , only you couldnt see them . after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on , it went back to normal . alarmed , i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again . it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again . but that was only one thing wrong with it . this is a horrible camera for concerts , the pictures are always blurry . shoot , even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes . tuesday i went to see my fav band again , and the dumb thing goes white . it woudnt stop , no matter how many times i turned it off and on again . now the flash is broke and i 'm ready to throw it against the wall . you ca n't trust this camera . you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute !
1	it 's a wonderful piece of equipment . love it . wish they made one for larger objects
0	the battery does not hold up . after 10 months it would not work at all . i thought it was the battery . emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable . i found one and changed it out myself . the unit was just dead . warranty is 60 days . will not buy another one
0	if you want a nice camera that works well for 15 months , then look no further . but mine died completely and is headed for the electronic recycling bin . i did n't realize i was getting a disposable when i bought it
1	although this is a good batch of accessories , the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times . it has no carry strap -- the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top . so , if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture , you must open the case , pull the camera 's strap through the slit , then lift the camera out . it would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy
0	i have to say that i really wanted to like this camera . it takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature . it is quite compact and has a nice screen . the software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface . why 2 stars ? ok here 's the bad stuff : 1 ) in the first shipment i got , the normal mode ( non-ultra-wide angle ) did n't work . the images were garbled and almost unrecognizable . the ultra-wide images were fine . i attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange . the second v570 i got from amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me . so , i do n't think it is just a random problem . there appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that i would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem . my v570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and i use a casio exilim ex-z70 . 2 ) the stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel . you have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle . also , since you have to charge the battery in the camera , you ca n't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other . for comparison , my new casio ex-z70 has a usb cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger . so , if one battery is dead i can leave it behind in the charger while i take pictures with the spare . 3 ) the movies that you take with this camera are stored in mov format instead of avi or mpeg . while it does play in most pcs if you have installed quicktime , it is not supported by my streaming media player ( d-link dsm-320rd ) and is difficult to work with in the video editor/dvd creator sw i use ( sonic mydvd ) . i ca n't say how widely mov is supported compared to avi and mpeg , but that format created problems for me . so , i applaud kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital . but i think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations
1	well , i 've had my rebel xti for about 6weeks now , and all i can say is wow ! ! ! i did have the rebel xt , which was an awesome camera . i 'm not a professional , but i do take pictures of what ever it may be outside or inside , youth or adult events as a hobby . this camera is not for the person who wants to just point and shoot or to have a camera to stuff in your pocket . this camera is for the creative person who wants control of the pictures they are taking . the sensor cleaner and wide lcd are just a few of the wonderful advances from the xt to the xti . the camera for me is easy to use and takes great pictures in auto mode or in my mode . i hope this helps you in your decision whether to buy or not .
0	hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states , i have a problem with my camera and i do n't have anyone to help , i 've been trying some help in amazon 's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where i can ask for some help , i do n't really understand why is this site so well known on customer service , but i just can not communicate with no one in the company to ask anything , i 'm just mad about this , if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there 's no such a thing like help in the help area . i need to repair my lcd monitor of my camera , it 's really fragile , so if you 're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm , do n't do it , they do n't care about the customer satisfaction at all
0	my primary camera is a sony hdr-fx1 . i bought the gl-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events . the gl-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image does n't even come close to the sony . the price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera . however , beware of the rebate offer . i sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected . the rebate facilitator claimed i did not include the upc code . if i had it to do over , i would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second sony
1	i really wanted a 3ccd model , but since i 'm just starting out and need to buy other stuff , like a tripod , monopod , media , firewire adapter card , camera bag , etc . this fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere . yes the usb connection does work , yes firewire does work , although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version i was using , not the fault of the camera
1	this camera was the best `` little '' camera i have ever owned . it is so amazing . it takes fantastic pictures and it is cheap
0	i bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera . the night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible . it snaps and pops all night long and i have to move it all around to find `` just the right spot '' .i actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise . i live in a single story 2100 sq . foot house . i should have returned it right away , but i kept it because i had no other monitor at the time . now , 10 months later , the volume control does not work anymore ! i am now trying to find a new monitor . i love having the video monitor though , so i will look for a different brand
1	for its size and price , this little light ca n't be beat . very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors . i think this is a must have for camcorder owners . my vhs family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy , so i see this as a miniscule investment for the long-term return .
1	i 'm by no means an expert , but i really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price . i did a ton of research and landed on the ag-dvc30 after much agonizing over `` to hd or not hd '' as well as brands and features . based on all the reviews i read , this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money . i have not been disappointed . on my first outing , i took the cam to the grand canyon and sedona . wow ! what incredible color and clarity ! i also really love the 16x zoom . it 's smooth and powerful . i got great shots of the colorado river from the rim of the grand canyon . i 'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great . it is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject . if you 're interested in good audio , i 'd suggest an optional mic . if you just want great video , awesome color , and ease of use , this is your camera . at the price ( plus the rebate ) you really ca n't beat it
0	the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 ( and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body ) . i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1 . with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out . if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera ca n't fit in the bag at all . there 's also no padding to speak of with this case . by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure , padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again . targus makes decent laptop cases , but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently . apparently it does fit some cameras , just not the panasonic fzs . considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
1	at a recent nye event , i shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness clarity of this lens performance . its so fast and the colors are vibrant . i am not a seasoned pro but with the 20d and this lens , it makes me look pretty close . i did shoot in manual and once i got my aperture shutter speed dialed in , it pumped out a lot of great pics . i have also shot some pics of waterfalls ( slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image ) and portraits of people and again , it oozed excellence . the 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom , but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience
1	this is my third digital camera and by far my favorite . i purchased after having a very versatile but large ( well large in the dimensions of digital cameras ) digital camera . i needed and wanted a camera that i could easily carry w/ me at all times . this is perfect . the fugi z1 fits easily into your pocket or a small case for easy access . just do n't put anything else in that pocket ! the one time i forget and did this i noticed a large scratch on the silver portion of the camera . as with all digital cameras this one takes much better pictures in good lighting . i have found , however , that this tiny camera has an excellent flash so i am still able to get good interior shots if i am willing to blind people ( or my cats ) for a few seconds . the camera comes w/ a docking station that i have found very useless for uploading pictures but you have to use it to charge the camera . i tend to just use a usb cable direct to the computer or a really cheap usb card reader that i can attach directly to my computers usb port . i took this camera to japan and it was great . i only had one day where i ran out of battery power but that was my own fault . this is a highly recommended camera by me
1	these cameras are as simple to use as any i have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much . great buy
1	this is an excellent battery that powers my canon 5d camera very well . although i have n't tested it against the spec for how many shots i can get from it , i 've been very impressed with the longevity of it 's charge
0	because the camera eye moves only in one direction , the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby 's bed . you have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib ( older child can crawl away from the view ) or see just a part of it . we have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad . we went with graco 's excellent digital imonitor .
0	the me-1 provides a modest 1.2x magnification for viewfinders on olympus 's e-300 and e-500 cameras . ideally , this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing . unfortunately , this did not happen when i used the me-1 to make a number of trial images with my e-500 , so i will be returning the me-1 for a refund . ( for the record , i wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting , with my `` shooting eye '' corrected to 20/20 vision . ) like other folks , i find the e-500 viewfinder a trifle small so that it 's not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time . the camera must also be pressed against your face when framing , which is not always comfortable . in some ways , the me-1 created more problems than it solved . the me-1 kept the camera further from my face ( though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses ) , but at the cost of *narrowing* my angle of vision in the viewfinder . divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares . the four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible , but those along the sides , top , and bottom were *less* visible than before , the corners considerably less . to frame a shot , i had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the me-1 than without it . to see exposure data , i had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image . more hassle than i need when shooting in the field . fortunately , there is another option that works for me . the e-300 and e-500 come with an ep-5 eyecup , which is definitely too small for my taste . but a larger eyecup is also available , the ep-6 . the ep-6 keeps the camera a little further from my face . and with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted ( a critical step no one seems to mention ) , the ep-6 allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all . all of this will vary from person to person , of course , and there may be circumstances when the me-1 is exactly what 's needed -- so two rather than one star . but not in standard shooting conditions , especially if you need to compose , set exposure , and shoot quickly
0	i tried the trick of resizing , but honestly , the image quality is still abyssmal . the images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out . please , if you 're thinking of buying this for someone for christmas this year , choose something else . it might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight , but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like , this will be a huge disappointment . the good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that 's almost guaranteed . so put this one on the `` must buy for mom '' list for the 2008 christmas season . i very seldom write a review , and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake i did
1	the compact power adapter for camcorder that we had ordered was in excellent condition and as described . thank
0	i received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it . it screws in over the regular zoom lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the kodak dx6490 . i suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future . the lens adapter by itself , does n't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else ? ? ? ben boykin , las cruces , nm 8801
0	`` lens error , restart camera '' message appears today ( mar 26 ) after buying production on amazon on feb 20 , 07 . when i searched google for this error message saw thousands of canon users having similar error / e18 error with older and newer version of the canon . i have tried panasonic and sonys before and never had an issue . i dread that canon customer service is going to waste my hours in getting a replacement and ultimately may end up charging me over a 100 for repairs like they have done to other users ( after reading user feedback on web )
0	i like this camera . some settings take it beyond the standard point and shoot experience . for a first-timer , it has been great . the camera rates 4 stars . customer service , on the other hand , has been a disaster . an easy share software downloaded update did n't load properly and led me on a trail of three customer service reps over the course of 4 1/2 hours with no resolution . after requesting to speak to a customer service manager , i was promised that a $ 7.95 cd of the software would be sent for free ( though it was clear he was doing me a favor because `` these cd 's cost money and do n't grow on trees , '' he said . whether or not the cd solves the problem remains to be seen . but customer service is awful . to recap : nice camera , but unless you have endless customer service patience , search out other options
1	i got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke . it is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures . its also very sleek and small
0	i bought the sd300 to take with me touring by motorcycle . it is so small , i can just put it in a belt case and always have it . with the appropriate sd card i can take a huge number of pictures at a high quality setting . the pictures turn out great , but . eight months after i bought it , the lcd screen suddenly went all crazed when turned on , tho there was no visible damage . i returned it for repair , no problem , no expense , had it back in two weeks . less than 3 months later , same thing . i know i did not drop or bump it , it went down in the 10 minutes between showing some pictures to one person , then to another , indoors . i called , was told it was still under warranty from the previous repair , and got a return label . then i got an e-mail saying that i would have to pay $ 97 for repairs to the lcd screen caused by impact damage . i replied to the e-mail to protest , and was ignored . i finaly called , and was told that tho the warranty was still in force , this damage was not covered . checking aroun the web , i found that this is a common problem , not damage . unfortunately , i had already authorized the repair when i found this out , so i guess i am stuck . i have several canon products , will not buy any more
1	i was very happy with the product . it serves me well . fast delivery , good service by the vender . i got the project done and it will serve me well on into the future . great travel storage case , heavy plastic unit . good quality light stands
0	this case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card . it only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap . there are other cases available with better features for less money
0	horrible camera . barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz.drained the batteries within a few pictures.so not worth more then the cost of a disposable ! ! sorry kodak ... but i 'll stick with the good ol ' reliable sony
0	this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position . i sent the camera for warranty service ( i had it less than 7 months ) , and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off . they claimed this happened due to physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i was just changing modes and the lens did n't retract . do n't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new . even then , do n't be surprised if they renege on the warranty . i had another a410 that did the very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service ( so i suppose it was no loss after all ) . obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside . in short , this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field . if you buy it , and plan to use it a lot , expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty ( which i 'm not doing ) soon .
0	the battery looked like a second hand battery signs of leak battery poles discoloured . out of country on holiday will return item on retur
1	my family goes swimming quiet a bit . i got the sports pack to take pictures of the kids underwater in the pool . this is a big hit . it works extremely well . i also highly recommend the sony dsc-t9 camera . it 's great for trips . it 's so small you can put it in your pocket and the pics look great
0	sure my canon sd-30 is super cute and i get lots of compliments on how small and sexy it is , but heaven forbid you want to take pictures with it ! ! this camera can not take pictures in low light at all ! every picture i 've taken at parties has been out of focus , which adds up to a lot of hazy photos of great memories . i took it back to the camera shop and the guy said i had the setting right but `` yeah , they do n't work well in low light . '' well if i needed a bright sunny day for every shot i could make a pinhole camera out of a cardboard box ! the pictures it takes in daylight are nice . but anyone who wants a tiny little camera like this is planning on putting it in their pocket and taking it to parties ! i got the sony cybershot 10.1 and it takes great pictures in low light . later , canon .
0	i bought this lens for my canon powershot g5 , and because it requires the use of a long adapter , not only does it cause terrible vignetting ( that circle the other poster thought was cool , but which is actually a design flaw ) unless you zoom most of the way , it blocks the built-in flash . i have owned four canon cameras over the past 15 years , and the g5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment . ( i would have bought the digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses , but it did n't allow flash exposure compensation ( insane for a $ 1000 camera body ) . ) i do not recommend this lens or any of the g-series digital cameras from canon . when i 've got the money i 'll be buying the latest digital rebel and upgrading some of my old eos lenses , and selling my entire powershot kit . if you are an experienced photographer , you will not like this system at all
0	we bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all `` eurocam '' for an upcoming trip to europe . it promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip . sadly , the camera is not up to filling this role . we will need to take another camera along with it . however , we will take the v705 for its wide-angle lens , the reason that we picked this model in the first place . it is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review . the need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera . if you do not need a 23mm lens , or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens , then you do not need this otherwise mediocre p ( point and shoot ) camera . good : fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens ; the 23mm is the default lens ; rapid start-up time ; internal focus and zoom ; chromatic aberration well controlled ; can use 4gb cards ; freeze-frame and extract any video frame . mediocre : soft images ; perceptible shutter lag ; slow shot-to-shot times ; exposure compensation is easy , but steps are too small for digital , and is reset when camera turned off ; flash does not come close to covering the 23mm ; image numbering basically limited to 4 digits ; flimsy construction ; no manual controls ; no raw format ; no optical viewfinder ; histogram on display , but too small to be useful . bad : the absolute worst menu system to be found on a camera ; excessive and unadjustable jpeg compression ; poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery ; unacceptable visual noise starting at asa-400 ; forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images , with inability to save the individual panoramic shots ; panoramic component images forced to 5mp ; overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image ( even with display on `bright ' ) ; mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results . synopsis : if you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot , this , and the older v570 , are the only choices . if most of your images are in bright light , the 7mp v705 gives better images . if most images will be in low light , the older , cheaper , 5mp v570 is the better choice . the camera seems very fragile . treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance . if you chose this as your sole camera , you will likely be unhappy with your choice . the only reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens . = = = = = some expanded comments = = = = = twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens . this lens has almost decent optical quality ; though the camera 's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it . on power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens , which is ideal for us . however , considering that this is truly a specialty lens , it would make more sense that the `normal ' lens should be the default . best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens . better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens . the camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction . this works fairly well , at the cost of even more image softness , but even-so , barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length . this in-camera correction can be turned off . doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance . however , being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is . the only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as : manual settings , a physically larger sensor chip , raw image files , or , at least , a choice of degree of jpeg compression . at the other end of the camera 's focal length the 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion . there are very few circumstances where one would want to use `digital zoom ' , so , as with all digicams , the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus . after reaching optical zoom limits , one is much better off doing any further 'zooming ' in an editing program . kodak 's advertised `` 5x optical zoom '' is , at best , misleading . actually , it is just flat out untrue . the camera has two lenses . the only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens , which is not quite 3:1 . the wide angle lens has a fixed focal length . ( note , in some places kodak claims 39-114 , in others 39-117 optical zoom . ) also misleading is the claimed `` anti-blur technology . '' as best i can tell from looking at the images , and at the exif metadata , all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa . certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera . speaking of asa . this is an opportune time to address the camera 's incredibly poor menu system . it is byzantine : being both awkward and time consuming to use . to adduce , `auto ' asa ranges from 50-200 , to set a faster ( or to lock in at a slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels . to change from `auto ' to the next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls ! on either of the other two p which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control . the menu system is next to unusable in the field . still on asa settings , the camera does have sensitivities up to asa/iso 1000 ( though the manual only documents asas up to 800 , 1000 is available on the camera ) . unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime , will never-happen-again moment , then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying . at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5 '' . the previous version of this camera , v570 , had only 5mp , but the same sensor size . by increasing the pixel count , but not the physical size of the sensor , the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor . this has happened with many of the current p cameras , as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality . my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp , as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact . another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which , when calibrated to the sensor in the camera , allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise . doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10 '' prints at asa 800 . if one really wants to get carried away , combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography ( where dozens/hundreds/thousands of images are averaged together ) makes 8x10 's at asa 1000 doable . people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak 's target market . back to earth . the v705 's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p cameras . mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression , which is not adjustable ( e.g . `best ' , `good ' , etc ) . my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used . this results in small files , with a lot of compression artifact . the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5mb in size , those from another 7mp p i have are 5-6mb . my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb . the more the compression , the worse the image . most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point . kodak picks it for you , and picks poorly . the v705 's video performance is very disappointing . it uses mpeg-4 compression , and at very aggressive compression settings . unless it is a video of your baby 's first steps , or aliens landing in the backyard , you will likely find it hard to watch . the total output datastream is about 0.5 mbs . compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs ( total , adding sound , error correction , and time codes , is 36 mbs ) . better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression , but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos . that is the choice that most manufactures have made . as a result , the videos from my other p have about a 2 mbs datastream , and so are of much better quality . the battery . kodak 's claim is 150 still images per charge . i am getting 100-120 , with minimal use of flash and the lcd on `energy saver ' . even 150 would be poor , compared with my other digital p , where i expect at least 200 , and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management . this camera has a proprietary ( and hard to remove ) 720 mah battery . my ( several ) other , p have 790-1120 mah batteries , and , i suspect , more efficient processors . since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle , the battery will likely last most of a day . we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25 % the cost of the camera . though the body is of aluminum , the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two . the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use ; there is no cover for the charge socket . the media door often dislodges open . truly , my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used : that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the ( not included in this model ) `` easyshare '' dock system . this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory , and the overly aggressive jpeg compression . shutter lag , the bête noire of digital cameras , is very evident with this model . i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter , and the image being recorded . however , based on over 50 years of tripping shutters , it clearly varies , and i estimate is , at best 1/4 second , up to a bit over 1/2 second . in addition to the shutter lag , there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens . together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment , an active child at a particular instant , or a wary animal almost impossible . the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation/price p cameras from other makers . the accompanying `manual ' is poorly organized , childishly written . `` finish reading this book , so you can take and share your best pictures ! '' at best , it was written for 8 year olds . the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the `full manual ' , however the address given is incorrect . when eventually found , the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level . panoramics , one of the advertising points of the camera , are another disappointment . basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in `panoramic mode ' , each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image , in order to allow alignment . as with most `panoramic modes ' focus and exposure is locked on the first image . so far , this is all ok ; however , it rapidly goes downhill . first , the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 ( not 7 ) mp . next , the image overlay is so dark that , even with the lcd set at max brightness , it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements . however , it gets worse . the images must be joined in-camera ! the individual images can not be stored ! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry . aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2 '' lcd in the field gives , in spite of the camera 's best efforts , much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger , and higher quality , computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home . the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment , and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills , making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings . of course , my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera , so we will not be dragging it along . you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production . much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved . reading back through this review , i see that it is mostly negative . this makes sense , for , as i disclosed at the beginning , it was my disappointment in this camera 's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place . likely i have said all that needs to be said . so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens . except for this unique lens , the camera 's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p cameras currently on the market . if you need a true wide-angle p , you need this camera . otherwise forget it
1	i really liked this cam bag..it serves its purpose very well and is really cute too !
0	it worked fine the first week . then the focus stopped working . i sent it to repair . it worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working . i sent it for repair for the second time . it worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working . also , it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at sony ! ! ! they make you wait over an hour ! ! ! si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for ! ! ! sony repair reference number : e3317596
1	this is a great lens . i do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens . it is not so heavy so i use tripod without using tripod collar ( costs 119.99 in b h ) . this is the best value i have ever got for a lens . now i ca n't wait to get 17-40mm f4l too . you can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6 , of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject . people complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective . i like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag . i think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful
1	very clear pictures , very happy with this camera . note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder , but this has n't been a problem for me as it 's pretty easy to use
1	this is a great back pack ! if there is anything i would change it would be the logo on the front . it 's brite and shinny , and i 'd rather not advertise that i have a camera in there ! i colored it in with a felt pen and it works great ... ... . overall , i love the backpack ! !
1	it 's well designed , the protection is very good , but you should know it 's pretty compact , you can put only the camera inside , nothing else . also take care about the color , it has some pink on it , if you are a relly macho and worry about it , better look for options
1	my sony dscw100 camera is small but very functional and user friendly , it makes photography an easy and interesting hobby .
0	bag is ok but you must be careful if your moving around a lot . with extra batteries in the top zip compartment it is really top heavy and tips upside down while on your shoulder if the camera is out of it . the velcro does not hold it closed well either . my memory card fell out of the bag during one of these episodes , thank goodness my husband noticed
0	i have tried everything . firewire , usb . there was an insert in the guide that mentioned that you have to connect the cable first to your pc then to your camera , then turn on the pc then turn on the camera ... then wait for the stars to align in the right order . if you do anything in a different order then your camera can get damaged . what kind of a crazy world does panasonic live in ? well , i followed the instructions to the tee , downloded the right drivers and all and yet my pc does not recognize the gs19 or the gs9 . i have used both . the gs19 is a new purchase so this is definitely going back . i thought , this model would have gone away with the kinks but , no ! so , my panasonic recorded dvs are gon na remain on the tape . i will never be able to put them on dvds . what a joke , this camera turned out to be
0	if you want a quality product , this ai n't it . the dreaded `` remove the cassette '' error is true and in full force . do n't take my word for it , search the net and find the hundreds , upon thousands of unhappy consumers who purchased this piece of junk and discovered it the hard way . i highly suggest the panasonic ag-dvx100 . it costs a bit more , but well worth it . before reading other reviews , make sure that they are comparing the gl-2 to another cam , like tony l. shores . he compares the canon gl-piece-of-junk-2 to the sony hdr-fx1 . sure , the sony is much better , but it is also a high-definition cam . if you want hd , check out the panasonic ag-hvx200 . do your research , read the reviews
1	photos were excellent . but photo print quality depends very much on the print shop . for the same photo file , it can look like a 4m photo when taken to a below quality printer shop . photos taken indoor with marginal lighting ( no flash used ) turned out to be yellowish . battery life is very long despite its large 3 '' lcd . battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long . photos files viewed on computer looks just great . 8'x10 ' prints are great but have not tried larger prints . touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set . date on photo is red ( would be better if it is black ) . and the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner
1	for less than $ 200 this is a great camera . it is by no means spectacular , but for the price , it does a good job . i own a canon powershot s60 as well , and the canon outdoes this camera in some ways , but it 's not pocketable . the f20 is easy to use , the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive , it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly , and shutter lag seems average ( close to the s60 ) . however , the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a dslr . the `` anti-shake '' mechanism is not really useful at all , it merely boosts the iso to 2000 which makes the image unprintable ( at least indoors ) . i have yet to try it this feature outside . i 've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights , especially outdoors . manually setting the iso from 100-400 will , i hope , make for more printable , usable pictures . i had actually thought of returning this little camera , but then realized that i could find nothing , for the price , that would be able to compete . i really wanted a 28mm lens , only found on more expensive models like the canon sd800is , or lumix 's ( which apparently have tons of noise at low iso 's ) . it 's pocketable , portable , and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it .
1	this is the same charger came with my digital rebel , however , i like to charge two batteries at a time . so , i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip . the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact , flat and easy to take along with you . it 's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with .
1	the flash works very well , i do wedding photogrphy so i need a good flash . it works great . i am very happy with this product
0	i purchased this set , and upon arrival , i found the circular polarizer to be defective . amazon quickly replaced the set , and this polarizer did not work either ! i returned the set , as i am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works . i 'll pay more , and get a quality product from a different maker . i will say that amazon is second to nobody for customer service . i appreciate that , and will continue to be an amazon customer . however , i ca n't say the same for tiffen .
0	with this pup it is simple to record video or images and almost impossible to download them successfully ! in standard mode , the playback of video is anything but smooth . looks like an old time movie . the software could best be described as , `` user hostile '' . i have n't been able to download any videos without getting an error message before the transfer is complete . the normal video is n't as good as my dv camcorders and downright sad indoors . the photo portion is slightly better than my cell phone ( a pocket pc ) . still pictures have n't downloaded successfully either ( approximately 11 out of 185 have made it across the wire before error messages start interrupting the transfer ) . it 's a handy size and easy to operate . after you 're done recording you 'll likely spend a lot of time with the manual ( i have ) and then you start getting frustrated . if i could return it , i would
0	i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e . same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product
1	i 'm new to the digital slr world . i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt . the built-in flash had done alright , but was nothing to write home about . since i had spent most of my money on the camera , i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done . this flash met both requirements . if you are an advance user , you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features . yet , if you a newbie like me , this flash is great ! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly .
1	the power-2000 xp-333 charges batteries in pairs , with one led per pair , not as described . the xp-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster ( 3 vs 4 hours ) . the xp-333 charger is very lightweight , the xp-555 is slightly heavier . they work on 110 or 220 v and includes plug adaptors for round european type plugs . i have used the xp-333 in the usa and overseas . power-2000 makes several other charger models as well . the xp-333 and 555 aas are 2500 mah , and there are xp-33327 and xp-55527 versions now available with 2700 mah batteries . aaa batteries charge faster as they hold less charge . aaas from power-2000 currently come in 850 and 1000 mah capacities . i believe that these capacities for aa and aaa from power-2000 and other nimh makers are twice as great or maybe more than alkalines . as i recall , some years ago duracell copper top aas have 1100 mah . i have not found recent figures on the web , but got the old figure by calling the 800 number on the duracell packages . duracell ultras appear to have a bit higher mah figure , but i do not know that that is . the 1.2 v for nimh vs 1.5 v for alkalines seems to make no practical difference as i am told , and i believe it is correct , that alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 v after initial use while i understand that the nimh holds its 1.2 v value for some time .
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her . this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon . it was , in my opinion , not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was . i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i 'm not satisfied . in this case i did not have time to find another camera case . thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion . linda sutto
0	have had it for a few weeks and glad i brought it great procuc
1	i read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit . i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try . the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty . the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2.8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp . be carefull with this lens though . the dof at f2.8 is extremely narrow . do n't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp . focus properly and crank up the aperture and you 'll get some very satisfying macro shots . the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer . canon , how about a 100mm macro with is ?
0	this adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my a700 , so much so that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identical to that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens . thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter . canon , normally a responsible firm with many excellent products , is beneath contempt in marketing this lens . i called canon customer service and spoke with a sympathetic representative who took the matter up with `` someone else '' . the outcome was that they admit that there `` is very little increase '' in the non-vignetted field of view by using this adapter . she said she would put my comments on a company-internal problem compilation called `` customer voice '' . i can only hope it reaches someone high enough to do some good
1	i am a busy mom of two young children . this camera is perfect for capturing all of their cute faces and happy moments . i love the fast cycle time . i love that i can take multiple pictures in seconds . would recommend to anyone
0	the camera is just plain cheap . takes nothing but fuzzy , low resolution pictures . the thing weighs a ton and even for all that the binoculars are only mediocre . a great idea , maybe someday someone will actually do it right
0	this bag is very small . my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens , but you can not fit more than one lens with the camera body . we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag
1	i am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera . i 've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots . the winding mechanism is easy to use . finally i have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember . it 's even suited for kids over ten to use . mine had lots of fun with their own quick snap
1	this lens is great . i 've been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful ! the only downside is the lack of ability to zoom . other than that it 's a great lens
1	after 2+ years , the camera 's original battery was losing its ability to hold a charge . this replacement battery arrived promptly , fit easily and was fully charged in a couple of hours . i wish i had replaced the battery sooner , instead of constantly worrying about running out of battery power
1	this is a very powerful flash unit that works as a master to other canon flash units . you can get very nice results with a small amount of experimentation . it does what it suppose to . i used it with the 420ex i 've had for several years and it worked fine . mounted on the camera it 's a larger version of the built in popup on the 30d with some extra niceties and lots more power . thinking of the 430ex ? cough up the few extra bucks for this baby , you 'll be glad you did . it 's a one shot deal , [ no pun intended ] , you 'll be using it for years to come . i bought the 420ex for my elan ii e about 6 years ago . it 's been a great unit . this one recharges faster and has gobs more power . you 'll love it ! do n't let all the dials and switches scare you , read the instruction manual
1	is an product of great quality , is a kit complete kit of accessories for hp 435i digital camera
1	i just got this camera a month ago and i am satisfied with it . it has a lot of features despite its size . and for point and shoot i can say it 's a great buy , comparable to other power packed cameras , it even takes better pictures sometimes . but i just had to give it a 4 because i thought i could do more with it . but you ca n't do much with the settings since it has it 's own default settings for certain conditions . but over all it 's a great camera . if you 're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek , this is definitely a good buy .
1	i purchased this camera online one month ago from amazon here [ ... ] and i have taken pictures from alaska to florida and in washington i love how the mark ii captures images imho more clearly than any film slr could ever take . best camera i have every use
1	to my knowlege , there simply is n't a better equipped camera for the professional investigator . it 's ir-sensitive mode ( nightshot ) is in b ( rather than cheeseygreen ) , far superior quality-wise to anything sony 's got , and it 's the only 3ccd that i know of with a low-light mode . the image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade . time/date stamps can be `` burned in '' so they xfer via firewire - again , the only camera i 'm aware of with this feature . the audio can be turned off which we know is a must . and best yet , you can disable the sleepmode so it wo n't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on . it 's built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand , but it 's still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame . finally , it 's totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing . the only downside so far as i can tell is it 's size - it 's a big camera compared to the handicams i 've had , and would n't be well suited for close-proximity work . however , the black casing dos n't print/siloutte terribly , and the 16x optical lets you set back quite a bit . highly recommended !
1	i purchased this battery as a back-up to the one that came with the camcorder . the great thing about this is , once charged , it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power . i discovered this last week when i wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but ... surprise surprise . its recharge time is very fast . the only negative part ( if i must have to give ) is , it 's a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder . i say go for it .
0	we have had this camera for about a year . we wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake . the picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working . we have a canon powershot a60 as well and have been very happy with the performance . i would not recommend this polaroid camera to anyone
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day . they are comfortable , easy to focus , and a great choice for the price . these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel , concerts , sports , etc
0	polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some `` pop '' out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , `` it is canon , it must be quality . '' since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance
1	just like any other minidv tape . good pric
1	i needed a tele lens to complement my d50 purchase . a did n't want to spend too much money on it but i needed one that a least matched my lumix fz10 in sharpness . this certainly did and the vr really works , i am able to take sharp pictures up to 1/40 . my d50 flies on it
0	just returned the mobicam- had poor reception , even in adjacent room ! smallo screen not stable - falls easy seems like would break very quickly with a 3 yr old in the house !
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera . the colors and the features are amazing . is very easy to use . the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button . if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out .
0	i wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as i can to help keep the shot stable ( i shoot birds at 700mm ) . the first thing my friend and i did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc . - one with , one without , the extender . result : - the image appeared the same size , and the extender slightly blurred the image . in other words - completely useless
1	if you 're a professional photographer , you can probably ignore this review . but then you probably wo n't be thinking about buying this lens anyway , as you 'll be off to purchase a nice l series . however , if - like me - you just happen to have a nice canon digital rebel camera ( or equivalent ) and enjoy taking decent pictures , this lens will probably work out very well for you . i 've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks , and it has performed very much as expected . for the price , it 's perfect for a go-everywhere lens . a few main points . okay , it 's not the best image quality . even on low/medium iso it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive canon lenses . it struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit , but for well-lit outdoor shoots it 's works very well . of course , it would be nice to have a nice l series with is , but if you ca n't afford that then this is a very good value lens . not for the real professionals , but great if you do n't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and , let 's face it , who does n't want a but more zoom

0	i loved this camera but i have had to send it back 3 times for the infamous `` system error 2 '' design fault which plagues many of these . the repair service is slow - the camera has been in repair 50 % of the year i have had it
0	i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera . i only have 2 lenses , but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables , batteries , etc . i think this is a great unit , for the beginner ( like me ) or the pro .
1	got the lowero slingshot 100 about 2 months ago , and it is really coming in handy . in the main area , it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted , 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens ( 80-320mm ) , plus a sigma ef-500 super flash . it 's packed in there , and the flash just barely fits , but i do n't need much more room . the top compartment holds extra batteries , recharger , etc . really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back ... just by pulling the case to my front ( no need to take it off my back ) . well made . zippers are strong so i do n't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out . perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer .
1	the case is great ! it fits the camera perfectly and is exactly what i expected to receive when ordering . the price was right but the shipping was a little higher than i expected
1	i got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer , and it 's great . as much as i 'd love to have a canon powershot , it 's a bit out of my price range . all the people who think that using the lcd screen runs out the batteries after 2-4 pictures are lying to you . i bought rechargable batteries from radioshack , and i 've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed . this is a good camera with good quality in good lighting . in dark or overcast situations , it can look a bit grainy , but that 's easily photoshopped . i recommend that when uploading , plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter , because uploading sucks all battery power right out . i recommend this for someone who has n't owned a digital camera before , or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price
1	i was able to scout out the different case options for my sony dsc-n1 . after much review , i asked my wife for her opinion and she picked the lcs-nb . it holds the camera nice and snug but you could work in a memory stick or battery . so far , so good
1	i am totally satisfied with product features . for me still it 's better than any available product from other company in this segment . i ranked this product 4 because it manual dial malfunction very often . if i select album mode it still thinks to be in snapshot mode and vice-versa . it 's out of guarantee and i 'll hv to live with it . anyway there are many products present in market in this series to go with like w50 or something like that
0	it was n't obvious to me which battery to purchase for the olympus stylus 710 . this is not it . i had to send it back and get the li-40b
1	everything was excellent . the digital camera , the delivery . thank you a lot ! ! ! !
1	being in hawaii , i spend plenty of time in the water ... so having an underwater housing for my camera is almost a necessity . i have been very happy with the results , shooting in the water ( snorkeling , etc ) and above the water ( surf footage-just watch out for water spots on the lens ) . some of my photos are up for view in other parts of the page for this housing . i treat things pretty roughly , and have been using this for about a year with no problems . and i am in the water with it on an almost daily basis . i like being able to use all the features of the camera ( minus downloading images or changing the battery or cf card ) while the camera is in the housing-something you can not always say when looking at aftermarket housings that are non-canon manufactured . everything mates up cleanly and works great , i am very happy with my purchase . just remember to rinse it off/soak it in freshwater after taking it in the ocean or the pool to keep the corrosion at bay , and put a little light silicone grease on the o-ring for trouble free use
1	i got this bag for a samsung digimax i got for a friend , and is a very nice , and usefull bag , she can put there , the camera , her cell phone , replacement batteries , memory stick and some keys :
1	i bought this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it ! definitely a good buy
0	the battery lasts for about 10 minutes even with a full charge . i made the mistake of buying two of them for my husband 's dvd player and they were useless . what a waste of my money
1	i am not much of a photographer . i found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great . believe me , it 's the camera . the stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time . i can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily . i 'm thrilled . you do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb . memory card when you buy the camera .
0	description or product is wrong . there is no quad independent power/charging indicators . they are set up in banks of two . one light for two charging bays . batteries must be charged in banks of two . tried e-mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger . e-mail came back as undeliverable . can not find any reviews on the internet for this charger
0	i ordered this item about a month ago ... i got the package in about 2 weeks and was so excited to open it i was like a 10 year old who just got their first bike ! ... i opened the package to only find a the charger for the camera ... yes ... only the charger ... no camera to be found in the package ! ! ! ! ! ... i was so pissed i called amazon and asked them where the hell is my camera ... and this is what they said `` oh im sorry ... we probably forgot to put it into the package '' ... what kind of @ # $ % @ # $ @ # $ % is that ... so i asked the guy to ship me a camera ... and to my luck their were no more in stock ... so i told the guy to forget it and for him to send me a return slip so that i can get my full $ 220 dollars back because of your horrible/terrible/ridiculous service . it is now feb and still no money back ... i keep calling them and they say the returned package is still in transit ... .ive never heard of a package taking over a month to get to its destination ... but i could be wrong right ? i wouldnt be surprised if i never see my 200 dollars again ... if i wanted to waste 200 dollars like that i could have flushed them down the toilet ... .what a rip off ! ! ! ! ! ... it was an amazon vendor as well ... @ # $ % @ # % $ @ # q^ @ # $ ^ @ # $ % # $ $ % ^ @ ... never again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	before i get k10d , i experienced with olympus e-500 , canon xti , nikon d80 . i used olympus e-500 to take lots vivid color pictures that i love very much , but no water resistance and no second display window , also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable . same thing happen to canon xti , no water resistance and no second display window make it little hard to use when you need to change settings . the nikon d80 is a great camera but also have no water resistance and shake reducer build in on camera , the color tone of d80 is n't the kind that i would love . finally i bought pentax k10d , the feeling of the body , the water resistance , shake reducer , auto dust remove , vivid color tone , etc ... makes me feel the k10d is the way to go . only complaint would be the limited edition lens are hard to get . get it while you can
0	i got to the tip of alaska , and none of the four batteries worked no power ! i missed getting a day of once in a life time pictures . david highe
0	when i tried to install the software , my antivirus said it was infected . i tried to install on a different machine with a different antivirus program and got the same result . i e-mailed celestron over a week ago and no reply .
0	although easy to load a smart card , this viewer was disappointing in quality . my pictures look fine on my computer , but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc . ( although i found that it the picture could be adjusted , it was never mentioned in the manual ) . the manual is , because of the comment above , disgustingly incomplete . if not going through the bother of returning it through amazon because i purchased it on line , i would not have kept it . i actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse , otherwise i would have given it only one star . i could have purchased a unit a circuit city or bestbuy and been better off
0	image quality is pathetic . it generates ludicrous amounts of noise even at the lowest iso ( 80 ) . rest assured , you will be disappointed . i returned mine within a day
1	i was amazed on how well this battery has performed . i did make sure when i got it i did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since . i can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder ( sony hdr-hc1 ) . it is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but i use the lcd when shooting anyway , and almost always on tripod
1	good camera for the $ 129 i paid . does everything pretty well , and your picture modes are pretty customizable . only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than i wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card . might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures -- but probably would n't be doing it with this type of camera anyways .
0	if you 're looking to capture `` the decisive moment '' with the nikon coolpix 8400 , stop -- -do not buy this camera ! ! ! for that matter , carefully check any digicam or other camera with which you want to capture `` action , '' because what you think you see , may not be what the camera has the ability to capture as an image . let me briefly explain where i 'm coming from : i made my living as a field photojournalist for 40 years . by the time i retired out of the business i had probably created something like a million color and b film images . i owned and used mostly nikon equipment all those years ( although i sure liked working with leica rangefinder cameras and short focal length lenses ) , starting with the original nikon f slr ( which i still have ) and finishing up with the n90s and probably ten different lenses of varying focal lengths . i like nikon equipment a lot . i decided to begin working with digital images last year . i was attracted to the coolpix 8400 because the `` spread '' on the zoom lens was the 35mm camera equivalent of 24mm -- 85mm . when i worked with film i probably used my 24mm and 105mm nikkors more than any others in my bag , so this little coolpix beauty had just about what i was looking for in one package . let me say that while the problems with the viewfinder and shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless for editorial photojournalism , it is , nevertheless , a marvel of human ingenuity . for many other uses -- -such as taking pictures of fire hydrants or cows standing in a pasture ( put another way , things that do n't move ) , it works wonderfully well . seriously , i shot an assignment here in tucson that was essentially architectual in nature . the images can only be described as superb ( if i do say so myself ) . i worked only with the camera and a tripod on the shoot . working inside i simply changed the light balance within the menu on the 8400 ( which you can pretty much do on any digital camera these days ) , did not have to check the scene with a separate exposure meter , etc . point being that with film i often carried a bunch of light balancing filters and sometimes a separate gossen exposure meter and all sorts of lights to shoot an assignment . even then , i 'd sweat blood until i could get the processed film on a light table . of course with digital , i ( you ) do n't have to worry about any of that stuff . one can check the image immediately and know instantly if you 're good to go . alas , the shutter lag on this , and many other digital cameras made these days , is the `` downcheck '' which makes me unable to recommend the 8400 . there is also the delay in the electronic viewfinder to deal with . the combination of shutter and viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible to capture an image , the precise composition of which lasts only a split-second . i have taken many good pictures of people working , `` action '' shots and the like , but it was only by taking large numbers of images of any given activity and then retaining the one or two that said what i intended that i achieved my purpose . essentially , my shooting eye ( which is pretty damned good ) had nothing to with it . it 's like a soldier trying to kill an enemy with a machine-gun -- -if he fires enough rounds , one of them is going to hit the other guy . marksmanship has nothing to do with it . same-same shooting with electronic viewfinders and shutter lag . if you shoot enough images , statistically you 're probably going to get a good one . but it 's not a very good way to do things . so if you 're looking to capture what henri cartier-bresson ( i 'm not sure i 've spelled his name correctly ) so artfully described as `` the decisive moment , '' look at a digital single-lens reflexes , or wait for improvements in digicams .
0	i bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda . it was ok . felt sort of cheap , but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to . big drawback ... .there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture is n't being shot , so the danger of scratching the lens is immense . my son was so afraid of scratching the lens , that he barely used it . some of the few pictures that he did take were ok , but others were not of the best quality . i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get , and i 'm surprised , because i usually love samsung products
1	for an all-purpose color film , i nearly always shoot fuji 's 200 speed . it has the cooler tones that i prefer in my images and a good saturation level . the only drawback that i 've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over-priced ! the only place that i 've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets . any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less , and you wo n't have to wait for it to ship
0	bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page , so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality . but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one . in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on , and in good lighting it is barely adequate . wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory card ... should have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer . you get what you pay for
1	i wanted to buy a compact slim d-camera . those with larger zoom are quite bulky , you ca n't carry around all the time . i think a slim camera is a better choice . i slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it . you ca n't do it with a huge camera . after i made up mind about a slim camera , my choices were either casio exilim or sony dscw series . casio exilims are very sexy . they have a lot of mode scenes . they also function as voice recorder . you can take pictures of book pages etc . they have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images . i was almost buying a casio exilim . being a diligent person i wanted to search more and more . i found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus . many people found it useless . that was a good reason to choose casio . then i found the picture quality of exilim is not really good.i found some pictures taken with exilim . they were soft , not crisp colors . search the web reviews made by photo professionals . casio exilim is rated significantly less than sony in picture quality . with iso 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . those same reviewers however found sony dscw doing a better job . there was no noise with iso 400 which means even in lower light condition sony did a better job ( less granularity in pictures with low light ) . big difference ! . one feature of sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro . it is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch ( 2 mm ) close to an object ( say a bug ) and still take a brilliant picture of it . now comparison of exilim and sony to summarize : casio exilim anti-shake ( it 's a bogus ) slim lower macro ( 2.5 inches ) lower picture quality ( detectable noise at iso 200 ) a lot of scene modes quick shutter sony dscw series slim ( in fact it is slimmer ) higher macro ( 0.74 inches ) higher picture quality ( no noise in iso 400 ) not a lot of scene modes quick shutter so ... ..i purchased a sony dscw 7 mp . i took lots of pictures . they are all brilliant , detailed and crisp , true colors . i tried macro and took pictures of bugs . you can see the hairs on the legs of bugs . absolutely no noise whatsoever , no blurry . it 's a marvel of technology . i took pictures of fireworks in july 4th using high iso setting . they came out brialliantly like professional pictures . it also uses a different kind of battery that you ca n't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable . so you may wan na buy a spare one ( about 40 bucks ) . but you can always recharge it . and it lasts much much longer than aaa or nimh batteries . it was a perfect choice . i highly recommend it .
1	it was n't the easiest thing to transfer photos from a computer and to delete the `` samples '' on the frame was no picnic either , but once learned it becomes easier . i went from frustrated to happy , soon enough
1	i bought this underwater housing in anticipation of a trip to the galapagos . it worked perfectly , and i obtained some really incredible shots , both still and video . the combination of the canon sd550 and this housing were amazing . i did make sure to lubricate the primary o-ring each time i opened the housing . but the need to do so was reduced by using a larger , 1gb memory card - both card and battery would last a little over two dives , before i need to change one or the other
1	i had 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses . while i had owned other digitals i keep going back to my old rebel , until now . we got the back up battery pack . my husband and i love it
1	if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt , you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor . if you love the fish eye style and have that camera , you 'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip . i was disapointed with this lens for that reason . the sigma 8mm is great . a note to the reviewer below . sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones . this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy . it happens often enough with sigma gear . with this lens , its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want . bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out . decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy . i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge . sounds like you got a bad one
0	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $ 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .
0	i bought my canon a95 in november 2004 . a little after 1 year just after the manufacturer 's warranty expired , the infamous e18 error struck . i called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate , and they quoted $ 89 plus $ 8 shipping handling . i bought the camera for $ 300 online , now it 's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it . for all i know , it might break down again after the repair ! the repair comes with 90-day warranty period , but it could break again after 90 days . and then ... there is an upgrade option . canon offers a program where you can upgrade a95 for a610 for $ 125 plus $ 10 shipping and handling . this comes with only 6-month warranty . again , it could be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires . i would really do extensive research before buying another canon .
0	at 300mm this lens is very soft , it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus . to do so , you need to shoot at about f/11 , and then since there is little light available , you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed . of course , the high iso then introduces other artifacts . the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on . this is a lens that i have constantly fought with . do n't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either , as it 's only marginally better . buy the 70-200 f/4l . it 's a far superior lens
0	the case looks exactly as in the pictures above , and the camera fits perfectly in it . however , the case is hardly a protection , it 's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag . the velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so i 've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors . fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around , so my camera stays with me in any event . there is a little strap on the case , supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps , but it opens too easily , so it ca n't be trusted at all ( the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case , which is not much ) . there is also a small pocket in the back , providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries ( 4 aa batteries ) and the usb cable . again , the velcro on it is too easy to open , even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket . definitely , this is not designed as a practical solution . just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches . if you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun , while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents , do n't buy this one . spend some more money and get a decent carrying case . i will
0	these are not pioneer boxes . these are mbi boxes . i bought them and was very disappointed since i also have bought pioneer boxes before , and when i compared with the mbi , the latter one is much less sturdy and even the index cards are flimpsy compared with the pioneer 's . do not buy these . also , adorama 's customer service is very unfriendly in regard to making their customers satisfied . they insist that they are the same , that i need to return them on my cost , because of their mistake . they flew from one reason to another with blame from that they have never carried pioneer products , to amazon 's mistake in naming them pioneer . but then their own website also has named them pioneer . anyway , just reconsider about buying any products from this company . it 's not worth it , considering the shipping is outrageously high . it is my honest opinion .
1	i had to decide between this camera and a panasonic . we trust the sony brand a little more , so we went with the sony . we were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter ... nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later . i also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we would n't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations . here 's what i think so far : great camcorder to do exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside and out , very easy to use , and small enough to carry along almost anywhere . still photos are not fantastic ( only 3mp ) , but good enough for me . color and resolution are acceptable . not easy to understand the lcd touch menus , but you can configure the buttons once you figure out which buttons you will use the most . i got the bare minimums for accessories ... bought a 1gb memory card ( memory stick duo pro ) ... glad i did this since i will be taking stills and short video clips to email to the grandparents . also got a carrying case , dv tapes , and an extra np-fp71 battery . i 'll be purchasing a firewire cable soon ( i 'm sure you 've heard , the usb cable is inadequate for downloading video ) . handycam station does n't really bother me that much , but i can see what the fuss is about . all things considered , i 'm extremely happy with my purchase . i think this is a perfect camera for a first-time camcorder buyer who needs an easy button ( there 's one on the side of the camera ) . a little more expensive than some of the others , but the price is dropping . best of luck !

0	we bought three of these for christmas presents and two of them stopped working already . they wo n't turn on at all . one of them broke almost immediately , and philips sent a refurbished unit to replace it . that one is now broken , too . the units have not been dropped or mistreated in any way .
0	this camera will probably go down in nikon 's history as one of its most over-priced and disappointing cameras . i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january 2003 . from the start , the colors never looked right , especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones . i also bought the sb800s ( 3 of them ) , thinking the cls would be a great addition . but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments . the camera has a wonderful feel , viewfinder and reasonably good controls . but the results are disappointing . the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition ( canon ) offers . nikon finally realized this and on dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $ 1,200 . it just so happened mine was in melville , n.y. , with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty . these include bad af performance since upgrading to v2 of the firmware , bad color , overexposure , blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value . i would strongly suggest that you do n't buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers . indeed , forget nikon and go to canon
1	i took this with me recently to australia and shot landscapes as well as others , and the pictures came out better than the film cameras i have used recently , plus you do n't need a scanner . this camera works great , a must have for semi-pros . pros , wait for the new 1d . pictures come out great at 11x17
0	it 's a great concept , but my unit was n't recognized by any of my 3 pc 's , despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit . one of my pcs runs xp ( they had no idea why this computer did n't recognize the magpix ) and the others run win98 ( which they said sometimes has problems with the magpix , although they do n't say that in their marketing literature ) . they gave me my money back , but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised , and in addition i wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them . i suggest waiting for the next version , or even better , for a better company to introduce a similar product
0	i was happy at first when i got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out . i was ok with the memory card getting wiped out but when i tried re-formatting the card my phone , computer and laptop couldnt even read the card so i ended up throwing it away . i guess you really get what you pay for
0	the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2 . of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100 % ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too
0	it 's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs -- this hood . how can you pay $ 75 for a great prime lens , and $ 25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it
0	i received this monitor as a baby shower gift , but it was something i had particularly wanted . i was extremely disappointed when i found it did n't work at all ! there is so much sound interference it 's impossible to tell if the noises are the baby or the interference . we disconnected every electronic appliance in the house ( cordless phone , microwave , even turned off our cell phones ) and still the interference was there . the video reception is awful , supposed to be up to 300 feet , we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible . i swear it was supposed to have `` night vision '' - forget it , non-existent . i 'm off the video monitoring ; i 'm on-line now to buy an old-fashioned voice monitor
1	this filter is an excellent cost efficient way to protect your valuable lenses .
0	thought i 'd died and gone to heaven ; this lens was everything i wanted and more . three weeks after receiving it we went to the grand canyon , and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus - now it does a focus dance , clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus . it 's not my d70 , which still works wth other lenses . this one 's going back to it 's maker ! if they fix it , i 'll revise this review
0	sd card worked fine for a week . problems arise then worsens over time for one more week then it just does n't work anymore . problem is not the pda , nor software on it . tried to use the card on a separate flash reader/writer . tried formatting it to fat32 , create test directory , data stays on for less than one hour . i would refrain from buying this product .
0	i was so excited to buy a camcorder that recorded straight to dvd and took pictures ... ... .well , the picture quality is awful ! i have gotten maybe 20 nice pics out of over a 1000 ... ... ..the problem is its so low in pixels . we hear about 5mp cameras and up , this camera has less than 1mp ! ! ! ! i bought this before i knew anything about megapixels ... ... ..you have to have 5 or more for the prints to be decent . all of my prints from this camera are bad ! and they are only good for email . that 's it . the camcorder capabilities are fair . my problem is that it does n't work well on the computer , and it does not play immediately in all dvd players . you have to buy the very expensive ram discs for editing ... .overall , i definitely would not buy again and i would not reccommend to a friend . i wish i had spent all that money on something else ... .
1	works great on my s2is , clicked on silver on main page but switched to black on order form , did n't notice this but i like the black anyway . looks good with acc
1	i was really happy with the telescope - it was a good buy too . i bought one for a friend als
1	we had a canon powershot s50 3 years ago , loved it . so this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera , we specifically looked for canons . we originally were thinking of getting the sd700,800 or something like that . but after we compared these cameras together in a store near us . we found out sd900 has the finest lcd display , more opitions in control panel ... so we came back and bought it from amazon ( our favorite online store ) . we used it in our last trip to grand cayon , lv , sf etc . this sd900 takes very good pictures , especially in good lighting conditions . colors are also smooth and rich . the downside , as you may already read from others ' reviews , no battery indication , no raw ( it 's ok , my husband does n't do much editiing anyway , it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer ) , control panel is sensitive ... do n't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and could n't figure the way out during the time of shooting . stich is a great function which comes with , but when in a very bright area , you can not see the stich alignment very well on the lcd screen ( i guess it 's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on lcd dispay ) . overall , it 's a wonderful camera , we love it . it 's my husband 's camera , i uses canon 350d , but i borrow it from my husband sometimes because it 's tiny compares to my 10 lbs `` moose '' and it takes very good pictures .
0	so i saw that this product got 5 stars , so i ordered it ... ... when i got it , its like `` um ... is that it ? ? ? '' it 's really cute , and really well made , but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards ... also , there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it , also , the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all ... other than that , it 's cute , but not the best out there .
1	nice and compact . the tripod does n't really work as i expected . i am using my own tripod . overall is a nice little unit for the money
0	i bought this lens and was pretty excited about it , but i 've been disappointed . previous to this i bought the 50mm 1.8 for $ 70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame . i need a wider angle lens and went for this one , but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results . edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible , even at higher f stops . i shoot with a 20d . the usm is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens i choose to buy in place of this one . the focal range of 28-105 was also very nice , but to me the picture quality was not so good
1	i 'm surprised to see that a lot of people only give 1* to this camera ! i 've had it for 2 years now and i just love it ! thanks to it , i discovered i had a real passion for photography ... it 's very easy to use and my pictures are great ! when i show them , people usually tell me `` you must have an expensive camera '' ... and i just show them my little canon s500 and they are surprised with the result ! i 'm just loving it
1	out of the box this is a simple to use camera . the convenience of having the video or picture right on a hard drive is great . i did a lot of searching and this one was the most bang for the buck . just starting to use it so ca n't say much for now . my wife loved it for its size and weight
0	we had this camera for about a year until on thanksgiving day while out of town it broke . the lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera . we ran out to best buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad . ( 2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird . ) at first we liked the camera and it took good pictures . they look great when we got them developed ( costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up , super cheap too ) and the quality was good . within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap . evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems . inside or outside . i am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i know one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it . also the flash quality is horrible . it takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it 's of an object ( anything really , just not a person ) it comes out pitch black . inside the lighting is bad too . the camera can never focus and it 's just annoying . i also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by sony that for no reason just broke . one of them broke while in a store getting them developed ( in the little machine ) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing . the people said there was no way it was their machine , that it had to be a default in the memory stick . also the camera is pretty big and clunky . at the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market , now it is huge ! i am looking into now buying the canon powershot 6 .
1	this is a great product . i wish i had not waited so long to purchase it . you must be aware that it only works with l type batteries . i though that it would work with p or m types , which is what i have for 2 sony camcorders . i had to then purchase an l battery ( np-f970 ) . my old camcorder that uses p batteries is able to charge l batteries as well . do your homework with the batteries
1	after checking prices with all the usual pricing bots , i found a better price , including free shipping , by going directly to amazon . this lowest price did not appear in the other searches , so it pays to go to amazon first . i replaced my canon sd400 with the casio and find the controls more logical to use . this is important if you do n't use the camera for a while , because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual . also , the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera . you do not have to remove the battery in the casio to charge it as you do with the canon sd400 . the vga movie quality is superior on the casio . still pictures appear to be about equal . amazon delivered by ups in record time even with a weekend inbetween . i ordered on a friday and received it the following tuesday . go with amazon !
0	i will start off by saying , i loved my sony cybershot . when the alpha came out i could n't wait to get one . it died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through south america . amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days . i 've spent 3 hours so far dealing with sony . most people i spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to business support , computers , video . they also contradicted one another . when i did get to someone who knew the product i was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it ' not replace it . now i am stuck with a lemon , and i fear i have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera . i highly recommend you read all the customer reviews . other people have had problems with the camera , i ignored them because i had faith in sony and thought the other alpha owners ' dud cameras were unusual . if you decide to purchase anyway , i highly recommend you do not buy through amazon , but through a real store with a good and fair return policy , that stands behine their products . places like microcenter will exhange , no questions ask . i am kicking myself because amazon was $ 100 cheaper then microcenter . penny wise pound foolish . i love amazon , but , i will never buy anything other than books and dvds from them . lesson learned on electronics .
1	handy item for price . not a great telescope , but a very useful tool to look at roof shingles , broken tree limbs , bird 's nests , etc . must be stable , but can be carried in a pocket , weighs very little and is very clear . very good deal .
0	like others , mine will review pictures but shuts off almost immediately when in i turn it on in still mode . bought in december 2005 , it is now not working . it is scandalous that so many of us have the same issue and sony is not addressing it . sony should be forced to recall these cameras .
0	in theory , this camera is perfect . fits into your pocket . video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of mpeg-4 . pictures are good if you know how to finesse it . perfect all around anytime camrea , right ? here 's the thing . i got the camera mainly for video . i just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that i could always have on me . also , i did not want minidv because uploading to the computer is real time . i wanted the sd card as film , even if it would sacrfice some video quality . but the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor/ auotfocus nosie . on the playback i cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses . it sounds like someone smoking a hooka . and get this , it even says so in the instruction manual , page 35 , `` caution during video clip playback , the sound of a motor is audible ... .during recording , the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded . this is not a malfunction . '' awful . by the way , the take a picture while recording video function is worthless . it leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording , and the still image captured is usually blury . whats the point anyway , i think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video . or you can do it with whatever editing software you use . oh , and one last thing . i have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic . my hand shakes too much . there is a digital stabalization for the video , but no optical stabilization for the stills . its a big shame , too . the camera is very cool . if not for the audible motor noise , i would have given this at least an 8/10 . but the lens motor noise is unacceptable ! ps . all cameras today should have a built in lens cover . this is one has a cheap plastic one , that you 'll probably lose
0	i purchased a 510 powershot in summer of 2005 . after couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens would n't work anymore . i cound't take any picture anymore . i contacted canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix .
1	this accessory is very useful when taking group pictures with the photographer included
0	the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over . i brought them home and there is fog inside . also inside is some dark crap that you can not get to ... and it is on the lens . i called bushnell 's help line and they told me ... '' well , it is n't internally fog proof , just externally '' when asked about the stuff on the inside . `` that is probably fungus , that sometimes happens '' i just bought the binoculars ! ! ! he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out . avoid these at all costs ! ! ! they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
0	i ca n't say for sure that my experience was typical , but i can say that it was horrible . the short version is : i had to return it once for a screen failure , then i had to return the replacement for a screen failure ( and a refund ) . in between the returns , i spent a significant amount of time on the phone with customer support . the manual was inadequate , especially for the wireless stuff . i also had problems with windows ( network bridging , i think ) that further complicated things . for the brief time the two units worked , i was pleased . the picture quality was good , and once running , i had no problems with the software . i take a lot of digital photos . this would have been the perfect compliment . i gave the memory frame two stars ( instead of one ) because , in between failures and configuration problems , i was pleased with the quality of the display . too bad i could n't say the same about the quality control .
1	this product offers a realy equity between price and quality , and a good results in photos
0	after owning three other canon cameras i am through with canon . all my other cameras were fine . this cameras lcd broke within the first month of normal use . never dropped ! all of my other digital cameras held up for years . ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen . never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times . this is a product defect/design flaw and canon will not cover it under warranty . $ 150.00 to get it repaired and it will happen again , or you may start getting the e18 errors . this is a expensive paperweight ! poor design . very dissapointed . i will never buy another canon product again
1	i think is a `` must '' for any beginner , for a low price you can have almost all the different size of ep . try them for a few months and then when you will be completely sure what do you want and buy the ep that you need .
0	i was very excited to see this frame , and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek . i was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality - it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago . the resolution was similar to my first palm pilot ( iiix ) , just enlarged . i sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces . i believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better
1	i love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it . the product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at . the s2 is is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags . this bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries , chargers and extra media cards . there is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot . the correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens . given that limitation , this is a great bag . the bag is very well made and holds my canon powershot s2 is very securely . i lay the camera on it 's back and that means that even if i accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly . the material is great and the waist belt is very practical . the strap is well padded and after a day of use i believe it is one of the most comfortable straps i have used . buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it .
0	doesnt work even though the lenmar website says it does . i thought it was a pretty good deal for $ 26 . i wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work
1	since this is my first digital camera , i really ca n't compair it to others out there . however , it does everything i need it to do and has more features than i make use of ! i 've never had a problem with it
0	the bag is suppose to hold two cameras , i have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries . i recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here . might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not sl
0	i do n't see how they can recommend this kit for all dx cameras . the dx7590 would barely fit in that case
1	upgrading to the tz3 from a 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited a few months to purchase when i heard the tz1 was being updated . with the tz3 , panasonic has fixed the main complaints about the tz1 which were : no build in lens cover , noisy images at higher iso speeds . imo , the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the tz1 . as others have said , this camera has a great build quality , easy operation , and a high-quality look . i ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when i opened the box . it has the look of a retro 35mm cartridge camera , which is cool . the chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , is first rate and looks great with the matte black case . the lcd is huge and bright . the camera 's `` simple mode '' does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable . the zoom is fantastic , but you need a really steady hand at full zoom , even with optical stabilization turned on . i did take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way in from my car as i came across a herd of deer . shot to shot speed is really great , unless you are using the flash . the red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i have used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you are looking for a great zoom camera in a small form factor , you should seriously consider the dmc-tz3
0	very disappointed in this product and amazon 's response to the problem . item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until i complained that it was not included , this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed . they have told me they ca n't supply the missing part ( the metal neck strap showing in the photo ) as item comes from a freight forwarder . i did not get what i paid for and unable to return because item has been forward shipped out of the country
1	i am really enthusiastic about this lens because it is an excellent accessory for my camera at a very convenient price . i add it and use it for landscapes , mountain views , nature images and such , and also for group pictures in family photos . it does what is supposed to do : it increases the field of view while keeping the whole image very clear , and in this way the pictures appear more natural -- a whole view and not a narrow frame -- with perspective and deepness also , quite similar it seems to me to what i see with my own eyes . a very useful additional tool
1	product is excellent . however when using in motion , whether on bike or vehicle , it is difficult to grip and falls off hand . in addition , the `` mode/menu '' button is accidentally hit or depressed by your thumb while in motion
0	someone earlier had complained that this lense was suggested to them by amazon and it was the wrong size . well , that person is n't alone . the camera i purchased is a canon s2is , which i love . the lense does n't fit it . i even bought the hood/lense adapter set and it still does n't fit . this simply is not the right lense for a canon s2is , no matter what amazon suggests . now , too much time has passed for me to return the lense . i 'm stuck with it , and i do n't like that
1	picked up a bushnell yardage pro 1000 laser rangefinder used online at another site for alittle less than half the new price . works very good and was worth every penny i spent on it . easily ranged objects and animals well past 800 yards .
1	it is light ; has 6x magnification ; and easy to use . this little tool is great for any golfer . you must know the yardage before you can select the correct club . how far is it to either the top of that bunker next to the green or the flagstick ? next , you just then need to pull the club that will get you there . fits on your belt through a loop in the safe carrying case or use the supplied clip to attached the case to your golf bag . these new laser rangefinders are better than ever and at a lower price than previous models . love it
0	the camera came with no memory chip . the online store had no more of this camera or chips so the only thing they could suggest was to return it for a refund . not a great experience
1	this lens works really fast . it is a great lens . captures the color in real depth and detail with my canon 20d camera
1	aside form the fact that canon charges an arm and a leg for a 1 dollar piece of plastic , the remote switch does work well . it does not feel very sturdy and does not seem nearly as well built as the canon cameras . people with big hands may have a little trouble using this product . overall , a `` must have '' addition for anyone interested in long exposures , images with excellent sharpness and depth of field
1	this is the first slr camera that i have ever owned . i bought it because i was going on a trip around the world , wanted a nice camera , and had it recommended by a camera shop owner . it is extremely easy to use , so easy that i could hand the camera to someone in one of the countries i visited , point to the button they needed to push and i ended up with a great picture . i did n't need to explain a thing . i also did n't mind carrying it around all day , it is very light for its size . i have owned the camera for four years now and it still takes beautiful pictures . i have taken all sorts of pictures with this camera , from landscapes to action shots and they all turn out great . the action shots are never blurry ! the only complaint that i have is that the autofocus does not work well in low lighting , sometimes it is slow and sometimes it wo n't work at all . in these cases i just turn on the manual focus option . all the options that the camera has are great , but to be honest i rarely use them . i 've found that it is often easier to use manual focus than to adjust the camera so it will autofocus off center . if i know that i 'm going to be taking action shots or landscapes i will set the camera to that mode , but often i forget and my pictures still look great . i think that this is an excellent camera , especially for someone that is used to a point and shoot but wants the extra quality that a slr camera can give them . there are also many choices when it comes to additional lenses , so when the photography bug gets you , this camera can stay with you
0	i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it . the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out ( displaying blue and green pixels ) . i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all . overall do n't waste your time and money
0	ok , i was hasty in this purchase . at first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case ... about $ 14 , shipping included . then i got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera i ordered . you see , the dimensions listed under `` more details '' are for the outside of the case , not the inside ( but it does n't say interior nor exterior , just gives dimensions ) . turns out , not only do you have to click `` more details , '' ( fine print ) you also have to click `` more technical details . '' ( finer print ) wish i had now . just wasted $ 9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case . electrogalaxy will not refund shipping charges , and they charge a % 20 restocking fee . so , at most , after i pay return shipping , ( the case is only $ 4 ) i might get back $ 2 . so , yeah i was hasty , but i was also robbed
1	was pleased to receive the kodak schneider-kreuznach xenar 1.4x 55mm telephoto lens and at a huge discount compared to other merchants . i do freelance photography and purchased this lens to use with the kodak p712 . the kodak p712 is a great camera and takes excellent pictures . by adding the kodak schneider-kreuznach xenar 1.4x 55mm telephoto lens to the p712 , it makes already great pictures even better , and what clarity . i recommend this product to everyone !
1	i love this backpack ! it is just what i needed to safely carry my camera gear and keep it organized
1	this can be a very easy to use camera . simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good jpeg images . it also can be about as complicated as you want to make it . it has many advanced features on it . i have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years . my most recent before this one being an elan ii e about 7 years ago . it 's still working also . the 30d is my first digital and i absolutely love the camera . i generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 iso when shooting landscape . but , the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod . i like to shoot raw so that i can tweek things a bit , but the jpeg images are very acceptable . it also works extremely well for portraits . it actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher isos . 1600 looks about like 800 film to me . this is a very good value for the money in my opinion
1	this spotting scope from bushnell is an excellent buy if you are an outdoors person or if you like watching the world from your window . you can even view the craters on the moon . plus it 's waterproof and comes with two cases and a tripod . the amazon price is the best deal on the internet
1	i 've had my d2h for 9 months now . i 've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great . it seems this issue plagued a minority of users . camera is very fast , exposes well and delivers results . it 's primarily designed to be a sports and photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts . it 's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it 's true it only has 4 megapixels , but they are 4 great megapixels . images upsize wonderfully . i love my unit , and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup , or wait for the d2x . the price of the d2x is making that decision a bit easier and i 'm leaning toward another d2h .
1	bought this camera to replace my 35mm camera . am pleased with the trade up that i made . the shape is similar to my old film camera . thought this would make it easier to adjust to the smaller size of it . it has made the transition relatively smooth . i 'm sure there are smaller cameras out there , but this one is small enough . the display is also a good size - bigger than most that i looked at . i am not a genius at computers , so i was concerned that i would need to adapt to downloading pictures from the camera to the pc . but , all i need to do is plug in the cord and click a button . very easy to follow any instructions . i did notice that the display `` freezes '' for a second or two after a picture is taken . this is not generally a problem for me as most pictures are posed shots . i did run into some lag time during an easter egg hunt this past weekend , but still managed to get about a dozen good shots . overall , i like the camera and only wish i had gotten up the courage to go digital sooner
1	with these weights i was able to send my canon powershot s70 to the bottom of the atlantic , and i have great faith that they will keep it there . reliable , and more professional than a brick
1	the camera is great because it is small enough to slip into your pocket and take wherever . i have been the main picture taker on our family vacations and get-togethers . we had a 10x optical , 5 mp kodak camera that worked well , it was just big and bulky , never to fit in a pocket . the 10x optical zoom on the v610 also works well , the lenses never protrude from the camera when i use the optical zoom . the viewing screen is large and very clear . the menus are very easy to navigate and the on camera editing tools are great . it would also make a fine camera for a beginner . the panorama function works very well also . i have used it multiple times with ease and it created great pictures . the camera turns on quickly and the time between pressing the button and the photo capture is quick . i have had the camera for about a month now and the best thing is the small size without having to compromise in zoom , picture quality , or functionality . the lcd screen does take up some more battery than other cameras just because it is larger , but do n't let that stop you from getting the camera . you will be able to take at least 70 or so pictures on a battery and a lot more if you are conservative . my only small frustration was when going skiing , i attempted to video my brother coming down the slope using the 10x optical zoom and the image stabilizer . it was at night and only the lights were on , the camera would n't focus on him until he was close , but that may be just because of the low light conditions and glare from the snow . otherwise the video has worked flawlessly . there is even a terrific function that allows you to pause the video at any time during playback and create a picture from that video frame . ( very useful ) my brother bought the panasonic lumix® dmc-tz1k , ( a very good camera also ) before i got the v610 and now he wishes he got the v610
1	i 'm a former 35mm photographer who 's a little older and not as spry as i once was and i eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere i went . i got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more . digital slr 's are pricey and as a friend pointed out i 'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her . she recommended this model and the more i looked at it the more i liked it . it is a fixed lens model , but with a 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need . it start up fast , zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to . it has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want . it does macro . and it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised . so far i have n't come across anything that it ca n't do . this is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi-pro who does n't want to go full digital slr yet .
1	this is the first is lens that i 've owned . i had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that i took the step up . keep in mind that tis is an ef not ef-s lens . this makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my digital rebel . i love the zoom range ( great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces ) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots . just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under `` share your own customer images '' . pete leclair http : //www.agentz.com/digitalimagesbyjpl
1	i fried my charger in mexico and needed to replace it . this was the exact replica and it works great
0	i purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend . i will start out by saying that when i first purchased this frame , i loved it . the display , contrast and brightness were great . however , after 5 short months , the display 's pixels started acting funny . they get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage . turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it 's back to bad pixels . myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue . in conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons .
0	if you are going to lay out $ 500 for a camera , you should expect a fair amount of camera . however , i have a few gripes here . first , there is no remote control for it which makes setting up a shot tough . all the nikons in the d series can use a wireless remote . you can buy an underwater case for those magnificent nikons so you can shoot underwater . you can get over 10 megapixels in a d80 , or d200 and you get that great nikkor lens . you do n't get much of a lens on the dc500 , and 5 megapixels do n't get you very far when it comes to printing and publication quality images . lets face it : this is an expensive point-n-shoot camera for a tourist , not a serious camera . nuff said . -
0	i read other review , and decided to give it a try . as soon as i recieve it in the mail , and opened the box , i realized this was a mistake . cheap quality binocular with `` high power '' being a selling point . it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place ! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation . you will be constantly ajdusting the focus . your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors are all cheap crap , and annoying to have it all on~ ! i am taking this back , and buying made in japan `` nikon eagle view '' 100 times better . you get what you pay for~ ! ! ! ! !
1	compare to the price of the product i highly recommend to any one who own canon eos camera ...
1	multi-element add-on lense used with kodak dx-7590 provides good wide-angle capability . note that this is a very large add-on lense ( screws into dx-7590 extension-piece which costs an additional $ 20 ) . does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications , however two caveats : ( 1 ) slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide-angle shots ( ie , corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus ) . suggest cropping to 95 % of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane . ( 2 ) size of lense will render pop-up flash and outside the lense focusing system ( ultra-sonic ) less functional .
1	i bought this camera to replace a casio exilim ex-s500 that was sadly stolen from me . it 's the same size , which i love , and as convenient , which is awesome . it has a large bright screen to see the pictures you are taking or have taken . it 's one of my favorite things ever
1	this can be used in lieu of a replacement battery . plus if an electrical outlet is convienent , like when shooting inside , you never have to worry about running out of power . also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc/ac converter . but not as overall convienent as an extra battery . i thought it would also trickle recharge the battery , but it does n't . nikon should add this feature in
1	fits my canon sd550 perfectly and no complains abt that . the quality of the product is pretty good . when used with the belt clip , its easy to open and easy to put the camera back . camera seems very secured when used with the belt clip .
1	over the years i have been using quantum turbo and later 2x2 units ( no turbo sc yet ) to power various canon speed-lights from 540ez to ex580 . with some skepticism i picked this unit as a trial on one wedding assignment . well , although quantum units still have a place in my kit to power metz unit , i love the convenience of cp-e3 . one recommendation . buy couple of extra battery inserts , if you do lot of fast shootings , and keep them loaded with good quality duracell nimh 's
1	i switched from the digital rebel xt . since i already had l-glass lenses , i did n't run into problems with the 5d `` exposing '' cheaper lenses . the 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor ! the burst rate is simply astonishing . missing flash does n't bother me , heck it 's a $ 3000 camera , i do n't expect a built-in flash . i have the speedlite 580ex , which of course is wonderful in itself . i also have the battery grip which i recommend , as well as the rs-80n3 cable release . image quality is superb overall - the 5d really shines in high iso numbers - more so than even the 1d from what i 've read . even at 1600 there 's hardly any noise . it allows you to take great , crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash . the camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time . the 3 fps might bother some , but i prefer the incredible burst numbers .
0	i 've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but i am not having the same experience . the quality of the photos are horrible so i started thinking it was me and i tried it with different settings , tried being very , very still etc but , i only get one good shot out of about ten . i have a fuji 4mp that i bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this . i bought this so i could give my old one to my daughter but i 'm gon na end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my fuji . we recently had snow here in tucson so i took pictures with mu fuji and compares them to the canon and the 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down . i do n't get it , did i get a defective camera or am i doing something wrong or does this camera just suck
1	i wanted to get a macro lens and everyone told me this was the one to get ... i 'm so glad i did . with the smaller sensor on my 30d , the 100mm is more like 150mm or so , so it 's a nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens as well . i 've uploaded a few photos i 've taken w/ this lens to show what it 's capable of in macro and telephoto . i thought the 17mm-85mm is usm lens that came e/ my camera was sharp - but compared to this lens , the kit lens might as well be from a diy pinhole camera . my less than perfect rating is that there is no image stabilization available for the macro lenses . when i 'm trying to hone in on bees pollenating a flower , there is a lot of shake . i ca n't practically use a tripod when the insects are bouncing from bud to bud , so i have to take 100 shots to get one that 's not shake blur - and i miss some really cool shots . in addition to the lack of image stabilization , i am frustrated w/ the sometimes unpredictable focusing that will happen as the lens is trying to decide whether it should be focusing at telephoto or macro . i wish there was a switch on the lens to make it macro only or telephoto only , so it would n't be bouncing from one focal length to the other all the time . i 've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro . the telephoto focal length is a bit long ( for those of us who can not afford a full-frame sensor camera ) for most casual photography . i recently used this lens to shoot some promo shots of some massage therapists in a small eatery . i practically had to set up in the restaurant 's bathroom to get the photos i wanted , but opted for this lens because it 's much faster ( 2.8 ) and i wanted to use natural light over flash . the lens is long and heavy for its range . with the addition of the battery pack grip , this lens added on is very weighty , so i may not take it w/ me in my kit bag on every shoot . once i add another short fixed focal length lens and a moderate telephoto to my kit , my guess is that this lens will be pulled out for only special occasions . it 's tack-sharp , but it can be frustrating at times
0	i am not satisfied by this product . the calrity is not good . also this is the most battery consuming device i have ever seen
1	i have just purchased my second m407 camera , yes that 's right i said the second one . i purchased the first about a year ago and have used it in the wilds of idaho taking pictures in all kinds of weather at every elevation imaginable . all the pictures have turned out great . i recently had a reason to take more pictures indoors , new grand daughter . again the pictures have been fantastic , have had several blown to 11x17 for matting and framing , great quality . i would make several suggestion to folks , buy digital camera batteries , every camera i have owned eats batteries , this hp is no different . if you spend the money and get good quality batteries they will last ! second recommendation get a sd memory card , if you are like me you will not be happy with the interanl memory and want to take lots of pictures . so , this photographer says you ca n't beat the price , for the quality and service you get from hp . i forgot to mention i had a camera that did n't work , and hp replaced within 2 days with a new one , no questions asked . good service goes a long way in my book . buy one you wo n't be sorry !
0	as a professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year . my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often , i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it . i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera . these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them . eventually , the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground . ( this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit ! ) the cord is indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months
0	i 've purchased seven items from amazon in 2005 , so i 'm not a complete rookie . this item 's ad title includes the word `` battery '' in big , bold letters . i purchased this kit advertised with a `` used price '' , but `` condition : new '' . the ad picture clearly shows a battery . i had looked at several ads and did not read the individual seller 's comment `` battery missing '' in uppercase , though in regular font . to me , a missing part warrants more of a warning than a `` comment '' . that 's my `` lesson learned '' , but i still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big , bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing . lesson learned : read the whole ad for the specific seller , especially the `` seller 's comments ''
1	i love this camcorder . it is very easy to use , the piture quality is great . you can record wide screen or full screen . light weight , fits in the palm of your hand which is more stable and less shaky when taping . the controls are within easy reach while taping . it is so easy to use that both of my kids have even been using it and they are only 9 and 6 . it is also a great price . ca n't wait for all our summer vacations to start taping . i bought this camcorder two weeks ago from best buy . i just wrote my review and then read the others and i had to add this in , there were comments being made that you can hear the tape while recording and then in the play back . i slightly hear the noise when i am taping , but i can not hear it when i am playing it on my dvd player . to hear the noise while taping you have to have it right next to your ear . but not noticable on the playback on computer or through the dvd player
1	i was looking to expand my lens collection without breaking my budget and found this 50mm to be an excellent first choice . i love being able to shoot in low light situations which this lens has allowed for me to do . however , the auto-focus leave a lot to be desired as far as speed and accuracy goes . i 've found leaving it in manual focus allows me to get more shots faster , at least in low light .
1	wow..okay so i was thinking this was a screen about the size of a smaller camera because i didnt read the dimensions before i bought it here on amazon so i was a little disappointed in the size . this is about half the size of an ipod mini . it is by no means big . read the dimesions well before you purchase . the photos are really good quality and clear ..just small lol .
0	the eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable . but of course you can 'buy ' the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer . the whole thing was a waste of time ... i gave it to my five year old to trash . at least he will have some fun with it that way ... .it 's realy just a childs toy .
0	i bought two one time , but there was no vedio on lcd as opened for both ! they could not recorded vedio but audio only . it seemed that they had n't ccd at all ! i had to mail them back to repare just the day i got them , and the jvc even would not cover the charge
1	i bought this camera to replace a high mp sony pocket camera , and i am thrilled with it . the picture quality is absolutely gorgeous in any lighting . the red eye reduction really works , and gets rid of the red-eye before it ever gets to the memory card . it has a compact flash card memory system , which is great because big compact flash cards are much more afforadable than the other types of cards . this camera is better than my brother 's canon slr in terms of picture quality , but not nearly as bulky and cumbersome . the battery life is fantastic . one other nice feature is the screen at the top of the camera which lets you see how many pictures you have , and the batter life , mode , etc without opening the screen . the only drawbacks to this camera are ( 1 ) not the biggest zoom lens , but plenty enough for the typical photographer , ( 2 ) the screen could be bigger , but still acceptable , and ( 3 ) when you have the screen open , you ca n't use the viewfinder , which is a little annoying , but not a big deal . i have owned 4 other high-end digital cameras and this is by far the best one i have ever used .
1	i was a little skeptical on this product because of the cheap price and the lack of reviews . but it is just what it says it is , and i am really happy with my purchase . i would definitely buy this again
0	the camera is decent . the fact that it does n't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable . what do they expect 90 % of consumers are going to do with it
1	this is the only tripod that i have ever owned , however , i do agree that it seems to be a very nice piece of equipment , especially for the very low price . it suits my needs well for a small digital camera . the only downside is that it does not come with a carry bag . this was an oversight on my part when i ordered , and i 'm sure i would have to pay just as much as i did for the tripod to get a bag for it , so i will live with it as is
0	this camera has major problems . do your research . go to any digital camera forums and you will see tons of post of the `` black screen '' . after using our camera about 5 times the screen became black . apparently had to do with defective lens housing or something . sent it to their customer care service . took 1 month to get back . 3 days later black screen is back . sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera . they just want me to keep sending to customer . care . sanyo has a very defective product and they do not want to admit their mistake and replace the defective cameras . see for yourself . go to the forums and see what others have been saying . do n't make the mistake i did
1	loved this ! it is awesome because it is both land and sea camera , so you need just one ! you can get tons of accessories and flashes for it . it is easy to use and the program it comes with allows you to do all kinds of cool corrections including making your photos more in focus in case you shot them blurry ! i can not wait to use it again , well underwater for diving i mean
0	this case looks good and protects the camera adequately , but is too bulky . it has n't got a lot of room inside - i was unable to fit an extra sd card in its little case and a spare battery . the belt clip is difficult to use , and i end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time . there are better cases for this camera
1	this review is for the coolpix 5900 with 5mp . you will not be displeased with this camera if you are in the market for a compact digital camera . this little baby lies comfortably in your pocket until you want it and rarely fails to deliver , no matter what lighting obstacles you throw in it 's path . the footprint is amazingly small for a 5mp and you 'll be amazed at the functionality . i found the video/movie feature to be a real useful tool that surprises most people with the great clarity and utterly blown-away at night shots in poor light . think of las vegas lights on the strip , or a crowd of people in thin night light . this camera handled it all . the sd card is easy to access , and i recommend a 1gb size so you can take your time with movies . otherwise a 512mb card will give you about 300 photos . but i warn you , you will be bitten by the movie bug and want to use this more and more ( provided you have disk space or burn the excess to dvds ) . i also recommend the san disk ultra ii sd cards for fast recovery speeds , so you do n't have to wait for each shot to record before going to the next shot ( this is 5 mp and that 's a lot of pixals to store ) . the roll on the side of the body enables you to keep a tight grip on it with one hand shots- a feature many small cameras lacked . the battery life is exceptional , but as always , buy a backup for travel . the hit of one star was for the frustratingly small on/off button . i know they designed it so that it wo n't accidentally turn on in your pocket , but my fat finger is not the best tool ... . the 2 inch lcd is not protected like others too , but so far seems pretty tough , rolling around in my pocket with sunglasses and other things that so far have not scratched it .
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera . the camera does not come close to fitting in this case . the camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case .
0	these glasses should not have the bushnell name on them , which misleads one to think they are good quality . i bought them for my son , and by the time i got around to sending them , i discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in , so the lens was misaligned . it was past the 30-day return date , so i glued the crack and kept them for my own use . they are still not right , but i keep them in my car for occasional use . my advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair .
0	made the mistake of taking this camera on a trip to the pool ! ! pictures were horrible . eye piece is the biggest pain ! ! do n't buy this piece of junk . if you want great , good , wonderful pictures , buy the fuji quicksnap camera . kodak could have done much , much better
0	i gave it two stars because it was great ... when it worked . i got it sometime in january , and it lasted until about june . i take good care of my things , so i know its not me . it just suddenly *stopped* working . i 'm more than just a little miffed . i 've tried getting all different types of batteries- i 've tried letting it sit for a while . i 've taken it to my friend who works with cameras for a living and had him take it apart and clean it and all sorts of stuff . its dead . i just threw it away
1	my 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera can not keep up with him . and i also do n't like the washout look when i uses flash . so i researched about which slr will best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments and low light photos without flash . the canon 30d comes up top on the list . it has the best high iso performance in its class ( better than nikon and sony ) . and when i combine the 30d with the fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/2.8 is , the result is amazing . i can stop any action in daylight , capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode , and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even the dimly-lit decors of the disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there for the halloween party at night , without flash or tripod . this is really an important factor for me to buy this camera , as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old . but you will need a good lens to make this work well . if you use a cheap kit lens , then it will probably not matter which camera you pick . remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens ( not the kit lens ) and crop the pictures to magnify the details . the sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and do n't need low light performance ( use flash and save money ) . the nikon has more custom function than canon , and it is really as good as canon . they both have their strength and weakness . canon just happens to have slightly better high iso performance and that suits my need better than nikon . to be fair , i should mention that the nikon d200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year , beating the canon 30d overall . but the d200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me , better suits someone more serious about photography . the d80 is like a `` mini '' d200 , but slower . so it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend . shooting in low light without flash will need good high iso performance , a good fast lens ( with wide aperture , usually expensive ) , and image stabilization . if that 's what you want , the canon 30d with the ef-s 17-55 mm f/2.8 is will not disappoint you
0	so , you go out and plunk down nearly 600 bucks of your hard-earned cash for a panasonic pb-gs65 dv camcorder . it is a digital video camcorder , after all . that 's why you bought it . well , guess what ? it does n't come with a dv cable to plug it into anything . that is so pathetically stupid i take it as an outright slap from a company that must think i 'm just some sort pain in their shorts . it cost me completion of a project that i had to put together as soon as the camera arrived . so , panasonic , i 'll post a negative review of as many of your products i possibly can over the next few weeks and make you pay as much as possible for being about as stupid a company as i 've ever had to deal with . oh yeah , and you 're camcorder is being returned . go buy a cable and have a ball
0	i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it . the quality of the pictures is very poor , showing large grain , even at shq and low iso settings . no combination of settings seems to improve quality
0	just for the record , my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier casio models . presently in iraq , i do want to have a camera with me , but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service . sad . it looked to be a great camera
0	i found a case that 's almost exactly like this one , except it 's $ 10 cheaper . it 's made by samsonite . model # tm90blu ( there is also a black case ) . but like i said , exact same thing . unless you care about your camera case saying `` lumix '' , save yourself some dough and get the one from wal-mart
0	there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . `` if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . '' read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !
1	the lenes work on the factory lens only with no feature to add additional lens . it works as advertized , i would have like to add the wide/tell lens to the filter for better out door videoing
0	the camera worked fine ; however , after six months , it stopped working . i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism . my use was in no way abusive . i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage , until i gave it away . i guess i should have stayed with canon . i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight , but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it
0	this camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box . one mistake i made was to not take my own sd card to the camera shop and look at the output . i thought the blurry image i was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera . i 've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this . casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work . and point and shoot is definately not an option . i thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping . i 've taken over 200 pictures and i will not print any of them .
0	bought this as an xmas present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel . i 'm now on the 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w/phillips ) , and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external ( in my case , sony memory sticks ) . the internal memory is pitiful , and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it , you are not going to be able to hold very many internally . i 've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work , and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device , it 's certainly not always mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with , and the directions meager . i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag , the fact that the support stand ca n't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course , no mention of this in the product description . also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - no support for the new , ms produo sticks ( and no mention of that in the product descriptions either ) i thought i would get a quality product from phillips , and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately , it 's turned out to be a piece of junk , one i 've been screwing around with for so long that it 's probably not returnable . do n't waste your time and dollars ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..
1	i have several different binoculars from small hand held to a large pair of nikon 's i use for wildlife spotting . i have never had anything that performs nearly as well as these do . i am a serious nature and wildlife photographer that has used high end canon photography equipment for years . when i saw a image stabilized binocular was available with `` l '' glass , ( this is the symbol that canon uses to identify their finest optics in camera lenses ) , i bought them immediately . these binoculars are a little bit heavier than a non stabilized pair , but the weight is easily compensated by the stabilizer . once you press the stabilizer button , the scene will lock , and the effect is amazing . i tested them by looking at a sign about 100 yards away . with my normal hand shake i could not read the sign at that distance . as soon i engaged the stabilizer , the image locked into place and never once moved . it performs as well as my camera lenses . as far as the optics , they are , in my opinion second to none in the world . the image is significantly brighter than any other set i have , and the calrity and sharpness is incredible . the night viewing capabilities are incredible . finally , a huge plus is that these binoculars are completely fog and weather sealed . change amibient temps , use them in the rain , and the will not allow condensation to get into the unit . a wonderful feature for those of us that use our equipment in other than nice weather . things to be aware of include : these are relatively large , which suit a medium to large hand size . if you have very small hands , your may not like the feel of the unit in your hands . second , the lens caps do not perform well . they simple do not stay on the unit . although for me this is not a serious issue , it is the one area that canon could have done a much better job . you can get around this issue by attaching a good uv filter to the lenses . ( you should probably do this anyway to protect the glass ) finally , the strap the the carry case comes with is poor . it is too thin to be comfortably worn for extended use . i would recommend you find a really comfortable aftermarket camera strap to use with these . summary : outstanding performance and quality . a little larger fell in your hands than some people may like , but once you learn to use them , i do not believe any serious birdwatcher or sports fan would ever let them go ! i give the canon l binoculars a 5 star rating .
1	pros : compact and complete , this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it 's reversible backdrop ( gray/blue ) . i also have used the black back panel for some shots as well . construction quality is good ( i found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel , which is fabric and held in place with velcro tabs ) , sturdy enough for its intended purpose . i like the output of the lights -- seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight . cons : only one complaint : the output of the lights could be stronger . requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture
0	i bought htis from amazon , and have troubles in playing back the video clips . almost evrytime , after a while , i do see `` system error '' on the screen , and then the firmware is hung . after a power-cycle , the last recorded clip is gone ! some issues with the basics ... so i called sanyo service , they said this is happening because i 'm using a 4gb plain sd card . acc to the support guy , max of 2gb of plain sd is supported , for more gb , a sdhc card is needed . i could not find this info on the manual or spec ... so i 'm not sure how true is this . if anyone of you know about this , please let me know . video is okay for my need ... still is too bad . firmware is just about average..not too great . there is much scope of improvement to be more user friendly and more informative with lesser use of buttons . battery did not perform as promised in the spec . also , there are way too many components in the box for such a specialized product . i would expect those many in a robotics kit .
1	i use this film just normally for everyday stuff . it is n't grainy when you enlarge the photos , and the colors are just outstanding . i use the 800 for the really important stuff though because i think the colors are more vibrant . but , for just vacations , stuff around the house , the 400 will do a great job . anything less it basically a waste of money . i shoot at least a roll a week just of everyday life and this is the one that i choose all the time . i have a basket full
1	great product , great price , great company , quick delivery . we love the small size
0	very slow storage even with a fast card ... .small but too thick for comfortable handling . i ended up selling it on ebay and buying a canon sd600 which is a great camera , thin enough to fit in your shirt pocket , fast storage of images and the battery lasts a very long time . i 've charged it once and have taken many many holiday pictures . do n't buy the nikon without first checking out the canon sd600 .
1	this is not a high-tech digital frame . it does n't play mp3 's . it does n't come with a remote . it simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode . there 's an `` on '' button and an `` off '' button . there is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame ( though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet ) . it 's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off . if you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location , or choreograph your pictures with music , then this is not the frame for you
0	i purchased this product about 2 months ago , the resolution is not the best but it 's acceptable . after a month , it turned off by itself and would n't turn on again ! ! i sent it to repair and had to pay $ 50.00 ! ! ! somenthing to do with the power button . i have it on a ups with battery , also freezes for no reason . i do n't recomend it
1	this product offers a realy equity between price and quality , and a good results in photos
0	first , i want to defend this camera 's lack of an lcd viewscreen -- really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point . what 's wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it does n't do the one thing it needs to do well -- i.e. , take a picture with the push of a button . this product would be much better if you took out all the settings ( what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera , for crying out loud ? ) and simply put in an auto-flash . as it is , you must consult the manual , push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash ( which is not intuitive , so you 'll need to carry the manual with you ) , press the shutter button to turn the flash on , wait for the little red light to come on , and then you can take a picture . then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity , and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it all over again ! oh , and did i mention that it wo n't take a picture if there is n't enough light ( there was n't even in the brightest room in my house ) , so you must use the flash ? clearly , the makers of this product did not test it on real children . heck , my digital camera is easier to use than this ! we never even got to see the picture quality -- after trying to get it to even take a picture , i knew this was going back to the store asap
0	i bought this in august 2005 , when the original battery that came with my nikon coolpix 880 ( late 2000 ) started running down fast . on the page i ordered from , it appeared to be a genuine nikon battery , however , when i received it , it was not . it was made in taiwan , and does not have the nikon brand name anywhere on the battery ( or packaging , as i remember ) . this battery has never held a charge well . it 's about as bad as the original battery is now , and i 've only had it a few months . maybe i just got a lemon -- but i 'd recommend you buy a genuine nikon , if you can find one
1	2 years of heavy use - not even one little bitty problem . they 've traveled well under harsh conditions , and they still function wonderfully . there you go
0	nice look , good feel , turns on fast , takes great pictures . really great , with ridiculous depth of field and resolution , you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the lcd back , which is huge . so , what 's my beef ? slow pictures , double flash , slow slow follow on shot , slow . okay say cheese , one second , two seconds ... . i only got thiis camera because i thought that problem was solved . yes my battery is charged , no i do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all ... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye ? slow- i hate it ! ! ! ! ! ! still , its awsome , slick , and a fair price
1	our firm uses our powershotsd500 camera daily and often takes long videos of our work for our clients and material processing . long battery life is very important . we have over a dozen of the canon batteries . pleased with them all .
0	gosh , i would really like to review this adapter , but -- - amazon has put my order on indefinate hold , as thier supplier is unable to get any more . but wait ! what 's that blurb on the product page - '' availability : ususally ships within 24 hours '' and `` want it delivered tomorrow ? order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes , and choose one-day shipping at checkout . see details . '' so they ca n't deliver it , yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow ? do n't order from amazon
0	i bought it for my 18-55 ef-s , and it looks like it is not very efficient - but i guess it is normal for a 18mm ( x 1.6 ) . i would have prefered a `` tulip '' design like those of sigma
0	but the stitching was irregular on the front . i thought the company produced good products , but i was mistaken when i bought this item . next time i 'll just go to bestbuy for a camera case
0	attention ! i got this lenmar from amazon . however , it is not compatible with my latest model of sony 's dcr-hc96 camcorder ! the camcorder warns you to use infolithium battery , and then shuts down . that 's it
1	i have had several digital cameras and this tops them all ! ! ! ! everything they say about it , is true . i love not even having to think about batteries , i did n't believe what people said about the battery life , and i was just happy i did n't need to think about batteries , but i just got married and my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures with this camera and her pictures are almost as good as the photographer i hired and yes the camera battery lasted all day and thru the next 4 days on our honeymoon with another 200 pictures taken , no low battery light ! ! ! ! ! i even going to buy my parents one . also , one more note i love how fast you can take pictures , no wait 4 seconds between shots . i had a kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old and hated it , i hated the download procedure , it did n't put your pictures onto your hard drive , but in it 's own little cubbyhole and trying to attach them to your email was absolutely a nightmare , you 'd have to identify the picture copy it to your desktop , remember what you called it and then attach it your email . this is the main reason why i purchased this camera . i will never own anything else , especially a kodak .
0	this camera is incredibly frustrating . i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day , the camera takes wonderful pictures . however , photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired . if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light , this is not the camera for you . the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect , the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably . since the camera does not have very good image stabilization ( if any ) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon . of course you can use the flash , but then your subject will be overlit , while the background is pitch dark . and forget about taking long range pictures indoors ( i.e . at a graduation ceremony or wedding ) because if the flash is on , you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance , it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on . if it is off , your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds . since i take alot of indoor pictures , this camera is worthless to me . if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light , this is the camera for you . if you want to do any natural light photography , forget it .
1	i have no complaints . i have had this camera for over a year and a half and it has been reliable , fast , and gives me crisp , quality photos ! the only option i wish this camera had was a better stabilization mode to prevent blurred pictures , but the software edits the blur without reducing the quality . blurry pictures are not a problem as long as you know how to aim and shoot . everyone loves playing with my camera because it has many cool features to make your photos fun ! i highly recommend this camera ( especially to beginners or for those who just want a simple camera that can capture those precious moments , with high quality photos ) . excellent camera overall ! ;
0	use less than 3 times , the touch screen does n't work.do n't know why~
0	bought this case along with a digital rebel xti , my first slr . instead of the 18-55mm kit lens i opted for the sigma 17-70mm lens . sad to say , but the case fits only with the kit lens.. the rebel xti with the 17-70mm lens barely fits . so a word of cuation to everyone , if you 're planning on anything other than the kit lens , then do n't get this
0	i have many pet peaves about this camera . a ) the video showed untrue colors and came out rather dark -- -- do n't try to record indoors b ) did n't fit into my hand naturally and had to use two hands to navigate the menu and even the record button . not good c ) did n't start up fast enough -- -i always missed the shot d ) the camera photos are n't of good quality e ) microphone not that great -- -you could n't even hear people that were standing ten feet away from the camera . f ) if your laptop is over 3 years old , even if you 've got windows xp , do n't expect the software to be compatible . g ) the zoom lens zoomed to fast at the movement of my finger . i 'd lightly press the zoom button to one side and it zoomed too fast and it did the same for zooming out . i felt like i had to just manually zoom -- -- ie . walk up closer to the subject i honestly say stay away from the samsung 's and the sony 's are n't much better and they have a monopoly on the matching accessories , ie . only sony products are compatible with the camcorder . i finally bought a jvc and they are awesome -- -- the take more light in , better acoustical recording , better zoom function , quicker start up , and lighter . you can even buy the cheapest model ( which is pretty much what i 've got ) and the picture is great ! my parents commented on how they thought i must have a camera like the news reporters , as it 's the same quality
0	i bought this product from a nearby retailer . the packaging is deceptive . the photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer . the battery is $ 35.00 with shipping , and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring . this frame has no on-board memory , so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts . this is an additional expense . after purchasing the photoframe i discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should . i took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before i found one which had an unbroken frame . i took that photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described . i then went to another of the retailers ' locations to exchange the device ( the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer ) . with the retailer 's very helpful clerks i tested three more photoco photoframe devices , none of them worked as described ( they would not scroll through and album of photos ) . i returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device , then by email i requested a refund for the price of the battery . photoco replied that if i sent them the battery they would refund its price . i mailed the battery on may 6 , and then inquired about my refund on may 14 . photoco replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick . on 3/17 i sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund . photoco said that my credit had been processed but that i might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days . i still have not received my credit for the battery . if you want to avoid a headach , avoid doing business with this company . read the other reviews before considering this product
0	the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over . i brought them home and there is fog inside . also inside is some dark crap that you can not get to ... and it is on the lens . i called bushnell 's help line and they told me ... '' well , it is n't internally fog proof , just externally '' when asked about the stuff on the inside . `` that is probably fungus , that sometimes happens '' i just bought the binoculars ! ! ! he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out . avoid these at all costs ! ! ! they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
0	i bought this camera like 7 months ago since it was so small and i liked the design ... .but the pictures it takes suck , specially in the night time or with flash , you can barely see what you are photographing . the video feature its ok even though you cant change the zoom while making the video , but the design doesnt suit well this feature since the audio-in is in the exact same place where you are suppossed to hold the camera ... so most of my videos dont have audio since i was blocking the audio entrace ... its small and portable , and i could fit it in any pocket , so thats good , but its so small that the battery lasts only aorund 90 min ... that 's what it says , but it keep going down like 5times faster than a regular min , so it only does last like 30 min
1	this just arrived thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far . i am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so i wo n't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls , etc . i agree closely with the other two reviews so i wo n't repeat their details . i 'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the hc7 to the sony hc90 , an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 mp stills . i have taken about one hour of hd video so far , and have viewed it through an hdmi cable on a sony 46 '' xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured a few indoor scenes , a few neighborhood outdoor scenes , and some footage at harper 's ferry in west virginia - river , mountain , and two trains passing by at close range while i was at the railroad station there . i can say comfortably that you wo n't confuse the video from this camcorder with standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they are n't kidding . if your tv can show the video off to advantage and you 've grown fond of hd , i think you 'd be pleased with this camcorder . in my case , the overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders was to get the hd video , so this has made it worth the steep expense . my second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so i only have to carry one piece of equipment around . i already had this in the sony hc90 at 3mp , so going up to 6mp was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself . my only output criticisms so far are that the west virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than i remember . i did n't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt . these camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which i have not explored . one or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage , and i 'm not unhappy with what i think i noticed in the slightest . the stills look very good to me so far , but i 've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the tv . i normally view stills on a pc . i do n't have a telephoto lens yet so i ca n't report on the quality of the stabilization . i used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video . i was very pleased , by the way , with how well the camera did with the moving trains . very crisp where i expected a fair bit of motion blur . lcd size and controls have been mentioned in first looks . i 'm perfectly happy with a 2.7 '' lcd instead of the larger one in the ux7 . so this was n't a negative for me personally . the controls ( menus ) are highly similar to those of the sony hc90 i already have . if you have n't seen them before , there 's a learning curve . if you have the hc90 or another camcorder with those menus , you 'll be right at home with the hc7 . one note : you can configure p [ ersonal ] -menus to include the things you use the most in your own order , in addition to the camcorder 's menus . one thing i forgot is that each mode ( video , camera , play/edit ) has its own configurable personal menu . so i was looking for things to add to the play/edit personal menu that i was sure should be configurable , but could n't find them . that was because they belonged only to the filming side , not to the playback side . so you 've got three personal menus you can create , not one . battery : check the sizes on the batteries . the hc90 batteries were very thin . i think three of the batteries for the hc7 fit entirely within its case . the fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that i thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1/2 '' or so . the other three will fit flush into the back of the camera , though they 're not behind a door or anything . battery life : my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate , but the batteries drain faster than that of the hc90 . this is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones . the ccds and the stills and everything are all `` more '' than in the hc90 . so i think i 'm fine with the battery life , but you 'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery . size compared to the hc90 : this struck me as being about 10-15 % bigger overall than the hc90 . it 's maybe 1/2 '' longer front to back , and wider as well . i think the hc7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder i see in best buy . but it 's noticeably smaller than last year 's sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i do n't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like i did with the hc90 , but it 's pretty light and still fits in the case i used for the hc90 if i do n't load other stuff in there . fit in the hand : i found a best buy with an hc5 and ux5 on hand and played with both at the same time . these have the same footprint as the hc7 and ux7 as far as i can tell . the hc5 's tape case is maybe 3/8 '' wider than the ux5 's dvd case . the ux5 's dvd case is maybe 1/4 '' higher . so i found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller ux5 and it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found that the hc5 's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb . as i played with this in the store , i realized it seemed like the hc5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this . absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you . just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ) : i spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year 's avchd ux camcorders would still be present , and if i would care in any case . the detailed reviews still are n't out , so i do n't know whether there will be a noise problem there . but i can say i noticed nothing in the footage so far that i 'd call noise , so my decision to go with the tape and hdv format looks very good to me right now . i have never had the problems people report with mini-dv tapes , so that whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) did n't weigh on me much . the noise discussion did have an effect on my decision , though . getting the video to your tv : `` how much money do we have ? `` , apparently . i played the tape back to the tv directly , but that 's not a long-term solution . i have heard that you can capture the hdv video and then will be able to transform it on a pc to formats suitable for blu-ray or hdv burners , if you have the money . then you need a blu-ray or hdv player attached to your tv . for now , it sounds like many people are archiving the hdv video to dvds as data files . then they burn playable dvds where the hd is down-converted to standard definition video . so they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce hd versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied that hd files captured by ulead software could be moved to a ps3 hard drive and played back to an hd tv from there . so far , the easy and cheap path we have for sd video to dvds to tvs is not quite there for hd based on what i 've read . the one extra feature i wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20x optical zoom . i 'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively , so i `` understand '' . but that would be # 1 on my wish list . overall , i am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now . i know we 're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago . but it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around , take some video , and then have play it back on a high-quality hd tv looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it 's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new tvs so beautifully .
0	i picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake . the class came chipped , scratched and smuged ; tiffen filters are of very poor quality . do yourself a favor , like i did , and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe , oh , 10 dollars more . this tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting
0	i purchased this camera in august 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is november 2006 . kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired . is that right ? it takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time . you try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a can not read device message . i have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives . i now have to go to my local photo place to get a cd and prints made and then download them into my easyshare software . oh , should n't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera . also , i had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock . when i put the camera on the dock , it does n't charge the battery or print pictures , the screen just goes grey . this camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me . the cost of shipping , cd 's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me . kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email . what are they afraid of , they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers . do not purchase this camera , it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera
0	overall , i was entirely disappointed with this camaera . the packaging and description were deceiving . there was no view finding screen , only a teeny , tiny window as in a regular camera . this was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera . i bought it because i wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen . the construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground . i would not recommend this to anyone
1	this replacement battery is half the cost of canon 's yet offers longer life . i bought it when i first got my sd10 . when one battery runs out , the spare goes in . the lenmar still works great while the canon is near end life ! i am buying two more since they are so cheap ! do not buy no name batteries on ebay . they do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money ! do n't do it..
1	this is a good , affordable uv filter for protecting your expensive lenses . i leave it on my lens all the time . this particular filter ( l-39 sharp cut ) is especially good for wide angle lenses ( 24mm focal length ) , because of its ultrathin profile , which prevents vignetting . i have used regular filters on wide angle lenses , with very bad results . although this filter is not multi-coated , i have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures i 've taken . multi-coated uv filters can cost 2x or 3x the price of this one , which i do n't think is worthwhile . all in all , i recommend this filter for canon or non-canon lenses
1	some reviewers below have said that this microphone does n't work with the sony hot shoe . wrong . click on the `` technical details '' on this page and you 'll see the sony camcorder models that this microphone works with . failure to look at which camcorders are compatable with this microphone is the fault of the customer , not any fault with the microphone ! so do n't give it a low rating based on your own lack of research when buying a product , please
0	we bought this camera two years ago . we have loved using it , until last week . the camera showed an `` e18 '' error in the middle of a special event . we researched the error online and found that almost anything can cause this error , from turning the camera off while it has a low battery to having something in front of the lens while turning it on . we 're not sure how ours developed the e18 ( never dropped or damaged . ) our camera has been rendered useless and canon 's only response it to have us mail it in for $ 100 repair
0	i really wanted to love this camera . the camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans ! i did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so i expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews . the 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it 's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video ... but the unit fits into my pocket ! another huge plus is that each `` shot '' is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a pc using a usb cable . no further processing - the file just copies and plays in quicktime , etc . another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie , which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do . now the sad part ; amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the lcd and ccd . the bad pixels on the lcd , according to the manual , are expected and `` not a malfunction '' ; i disagree with that . for the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the lcd monitor . the huge problem is the bad pixels on the ccd ! this results with white pixels being recorded on the files ; this is compounded by the `` image stabilization '' . the image stabilization shifts the image the ccd receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great ! however , as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well . it 's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record . the bad ccd is the reason why i ca n't love the c6 ... i gave up hope and sent both back to amazon . i 'm not sure what i will buy now .
0	i was super-excited to get this camera , and very disappointed with it once i did . the pictures are blurry far more often than not , even when resting the camera on a table or solid object . additionally , it 's so slow at taking them that any movement ( eyes blinking , etc ) likes like a massive blur . and the video skips all the time . it just misses entire parts . i would highly recommend not getting this camera .
1	this camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera . i too was disappointed after converting the raw files with c1 pro and acr . was it possible that my d-rebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like swartzenegger 's arm ? even with l glass the results were dissapointing . the problem is not with the camera but with the workflow . after using it for 2 months i am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results i am looking for . i had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves . once i got over the fact that i would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before i was content and have never touched the d-rebel ever since . ps beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any l zoom lens . buy the hand strap or a better neck strap . some photo samples can be found here : http : //www.trekearth.com/members/nbournas/photos
0	i bought this camera for its great price , good reviews , and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter . i returned the camera after three weeks , however , due to abysmal low light performance among other things . the catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child . i took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor/delivery and follow up . unfortunately , when we returned home to view our footage , much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes . the camera does include a light and a magicpix option , but unless you 're using a tripod , you 're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect ( perfect for recreating `` thriller music videos , '' but not much help otherwise . ) i also found the image quality with the gs31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated . granted , you get what you pay for , but i was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage . that being said , the camera did a lot better in good/outdoor lighting ( albeit still somewhat pixilated ) , and the zoom is incredible . the camera is very light and smaller than i anticipated . in the end , i returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment ( ... ) i will say that amazon did a great job with customer service throughout . also , if you do buy this camera , make sure to buy the dv cable ( firewire for macs ) through amazon or some other online retailer . ( ...
1	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens . at $ 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars . the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses
0	i got this lens in a kit with a nikon d80 camera . this lens failed to deliver the goods 99 % of the time . why buy an expensive camera and then use a cheap lens like this ? its silly to spend big money on the camera and have only blurry pictures to show from it . it was only tolerable in very bright situations and using less than 100mm focal length . a cloudly day or all of the 200 mm zoom would result in a picture that had significant distortion noticeable even on little 4x6 prints . very few pictures came out when it was used in the fullest zoom ( 200mm ) . i disliked this lens enough to return the entire camera kit and purchase a different camera ( d200 ) that came with the highly ranked 18-200 vr lens from nikon . if your interested in nice sharp pics , then pass on this lens . if you want to save a few bucks and like blurry photos , this lens is for you..
1	from all the reviews i read , i expected certain pros and cons from this lens . i was not disappointed . pros : very sharp lens with very good colors cons : vignetting at wide open , and a little too contrasty for myself , the pros outweighed the cons for the price . it is ideal for the 1.6 multiplier cameras , where it becomes a 38mm lens
0	i lost the weights the second day of use . bottom line the motion of the water as you swim unscrews the weights from the camera body . save your money on this one .
1	this is the first is lens that i 've owned . i had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that i took the step up . keep in mind that tis is an ef not ef-s lens . this makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my digital rebel . i love the zoom range ( great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces ) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots . just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under `` share your own customer images '' . pete leclair http : //www.agentz.com/digitalimagesbyjpl
0	a close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera . honestly olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $ 400 . i 've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10 . if you 're going to spend that much on a camera , get the d70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with . the pictures are better and it offers more mp
0	just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted . never used . returned it
1	this is enough of an instrument to show you new things in the sky for years to come . it is sturdy and simple to operate . it has enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) to reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , and galaxies and good enough optics to show you the surface of planets like jupiter , saturn , and mars . some advice on selection . dobsonians like this one come in a range of sizes . a 114mm ( 4 ½ '' ) is a bit on the small side but still a fine instrument , especially if your ability to carry large objects is limited . a 150-200mm ( 6-8 '' ) scope is right in the middle of the recommended range . a 250mm ( 10 '' ) like this one is on the big side , and you should buy one only if you are able-bodied . some advice on use . viewing through a telescope is less like playing a cd and more like playing a guitar . finding objects takes a little bit of practice . the 9x50mm `` crosshair '' finder supplied with this scope is great for fine searching , but i recommend supplementing it with a red-dot finder to aid in initial pointing . you will also need to buy an atlas ( sky telescope 's pocket sky atlas is the best available ) , a red flashlight to view the charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , and a guidebook to lead you to interesting objects . these investments will greatly add to your enjoyment . what more can i say ? this is the kind of scope that experienced observers have been trying to steer novices towards for decades . although , i recommend that you do your homework before buying any scope -- learn the sky and get to know experienced stargazers who can advise you -- when it comes time to purchase , you could hardly do better than this scope . for more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here on amazon , `` so you want to buy a telescope .
1	this case fits the camera perfectly . you hardly notice it when it 's attached to your belt .
0	for quite sometime lured by media publicity i thought sony a good brand . but this was not at all true for digital cameras . i bought this p73 for myself and an hp 4 mp camera for my cousin much cheaper than sony . both 3x optical zoom . the hp one was far better in image quality . main problem is that photo quality is not so good . it lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy . this fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a cannon or an hp camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions . also , in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom , say 5x or so in other brands . also during video , every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off , another irritating fact . not recommended
0	like most people i got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image . i 've been pleased with the image quality when it works , but from the start it 's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment . sure enough : * the shutter cover has often stuck open or shut . * sometimes it refuses to start at all . * it sometimes powers on as you 're putting it into your pocket , which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera . * finally , the lcd stopped working altogether . this is after 8 months . casio has decided i 'm not under warranty ( no explanation as to why , no phone number to argue with them ) , and is charging me $ 97 to repair it . do n't be seduced ! it 's a poor quality product
1	if you take lots of photos , rechargeable batteries are the way to go . carry the other charged batteries with you in case you need to swap them out
0	i had an older canon camcorder that i was very happy with , so i decided to get this new one . i ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud . i even tried the same model at best buy to make sure it was n't just a defective camera . but compared to a similar sony model , the canon was noticeably louder while operating . way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions
0	i admit that i 'm far from an expert on digital cameras . i did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years . i purchased a 510 powershot in july of 2005 . it was n't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens would n't work . i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them . i can understand them saying , 'we 'll charge you at first , but once we establish that the fault is due to us , we 'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera ( in the mail ) and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back . ( i also emailed them the same request ) . neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon 's behalf . that in itself was enough for me and i 've been bitter about that ever since . i 've also told every person that i 've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident . i 'm pleased to say , i 've steered most away from this company . what else can i say about this camera : this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture . i 've missed out on some good shots due to this . it eats batteries like there 's no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa 's to even make this camera worth its while . i 've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a 3 minute movie ( with this camera ) in my home during the day and go outside , most things outside are very white . almost like looking at an infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during the day , everything is dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras are this way ? i would n't recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think about that . you have to pay the shipping for a camera that 's barely a few months old and still under warranty . that 's disgusting , that 's all i have to say . there should be a zero for this , not a 1 star
1	this was one of the first lenses that i purchased with my rebel xt . now after taking several thousand pictures with it i can honestly say it was well worth the cost . i very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod . i also have the 180mm f/3.5l macro lens , which costs about 3 times more than this lens , and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4x and 2x tc 's , it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod . the 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your iso up a little to do so . i have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results . all-in-all , given it 's small size and light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot
0	good : motor drive speed . grip feel . takes nikon lenses . reacts fast to pressing the shutter release . bad : skin tone renditions a color other than skin . white balance does n't balance well . noise at anything above iso 200 , looks like 3200 . cf card door tough to open . screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot . battery cover is not part of the battery . button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 . 4.1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements . dumped mine a month after i got it
1	a really cool digital picture frame , very simple to use and supports all types of memory cards even a pen drive
1	i have own this camcorder for 6 month it 's a good camcorder , esay to use , easy to bring as it 's design purpose , pc-55 is enough for home use only one thing i want to mention here , before i buy this camcorder , i thought that i can record video on ms duo in mepg format , and it 's easy for post-edit on pc , you know , tansfer a minidv tape to computer may need a huge space to save . however , when i replay the video which stored on ms , the sreen was full of mosaic fortunately , when use dv type to record , this situation never happens . good quality . the one press photo button also becomes useless because the bad quality
1	i looked at this camera the panasonic hvx200 , the sonys , the jvc 200 , and even canon 's bigger brother the x1 . i found this one to have fantastic reviews on dvinfo.net , a great video forum . my concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction- there really is n't a difference . i like tape vs the hvx 's expensive storage solutions . one concern i had was , will it look like a pro camera ? that is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent . as soon as i opened the box i was in love ! this is a really substantial camera . especially with the opt wide angle from canon and the matte box provided , this does not look like your mama 's camcorder . i really like the manual controls , so that you do n't have to go thru menus to change parameters . the layout of everything is great . i really like the dual on/off and zoom controls- top of handle plus rear right side . holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very , very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned . only down side- and it is incidental . the matte box is a bit flimsy- lightweight plastic . that helps with weight , but i worry about breaking it . some may say that hdv codec is not as good as dvcpro , but my eye does not see it . the colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light . if you are looking for point and shoot , this is not your baby , but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price- this is it
1	now , this is n't the fastest card on the market . but it is a solid , reliable card . the camera itself is the bottle kneck , and typically not this card . however , if you are using a canon dslr of a recent flavor , i would check if it needs to be rma 'd . a known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images . scary . however , i 've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or rebel xt . i 've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my pd70x , and definately not with my rebel xt
1	i 've been waiting for this technology for years . so when i found out jvc was planning on coming out with their 4 gb microdrive version , i had to have one . the $ 1500 price tag was too much though . then i found out the gz-mg50 was coming out , and would be about a $ 1000 . i thought it was still a little pricey , but i could n't wait any longer . so far , the camera has performed great . it 's been easy to use and easy to transfer the files to my computer then to dvd . however , the video editing software that came with it seems a bit cheap , but it gets the job done . maybe the next gen version will be an improvement . the movie quality is very good . i wo n't give it a `` great '' because i occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned dvds . do n't bother taking pictures with this , unless you only plan on emailing them . the quality is far too low to use to capture those precious moments . i recommend getting an additional battery ( the three hour model ) . the one hour battery just does n't cut it , especially if you want to review your scenes while you 're out shooting . if jvc gave the camcorder a larger ccd and included better software , i would have given this a 5 star rating , otherwise i think they are on the right track , and in a few years , the minidv may be as forgotten as the eight-track .
0	be warned , if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive , you simply can not transfer your video files to your computer for editing , sharing , whatever . ca n't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step . i was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks , but could n't find one . i searched all over , asked in several places on the apple web boards , talked to the 'geniuses ' at the apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive . talk about crazy !
1	better than a photo album for showing off a series of pictures . buttons are fairly intuitive , instructions are understandable , and there 's nothing like being the `` first kid on the block '' with a new toy . getting all sorts of comments about my picture show
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel ( grey body ) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level . one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation . i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall
0	i purchased the wp-dc700 underwater case for my a70 and followed the directions exactly , oiling the gasket and cleaning it after each use . it leaked and ruined my month old camera . customer service was rude , blamed me and then tried to bargain with me to fix it for $ 190 instead of the $ 280 that they initially requested . the underwater case has a 7 day waranty and the camera is not covered for water damage . my father had a similar problem with his $ 1000 nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason , they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $ 500 . so beware of bad customer service . canon 's customer service has all bad unreasolved reviews at the better business burea
0	this product will only display 142 photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card . this little fact is n't mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual ( hidden from consumer ) . i initially loaded 1,400 photos onto a 128mb card and was shocked to only see 142 displayed . a firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to 250 , but i could never get the file to load into the frame . another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music . it would have been nice to hear a random music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on . definitely not worth the price . shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback
0	i have had this camera since jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings . do n't expect much from it and you will be happy . as an entry level dslr it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions . i find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light , provided that they are not moving . cons : in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well . battery dies fast . the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting , especially when shooting in raw mode . i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode ( approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge ( over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day . i can not tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike . so i always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . the viewfinder is very dim . when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d , it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d 's viewfinder . in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap , especially when having to resort to manual focus . autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible . when shooting indoors , the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject . i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur . this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus . the 420ex flash is supposed to `` talk '' to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed . however , with the 300d , this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed . after about five months , the shutter button started sticking . i would click it and then it would remain depressed . the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little . another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button . and since there is only one thumbwheel , it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed . for example , if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature , then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel . when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera , this is a real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you are a casual point and shoot person , it 's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos . but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately , look elsewhere
1	when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery . they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes . now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime , a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good `` business '' choice . so i said no . so i got the camera , charged the battery until the light went green ( which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it ) and started taking pictures ( oh i also got a 2g cf ) worked great ... .so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots . keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong , still have 200 shots left for the trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button . so all in all , i think the battery life is great , now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point , the original will work fine . as for the quality of photos ... ..i love them
1	the philips 8-inch digital picture frame is an excellent , high-quality device . very easy to get it going - the included cable and computer software make it simple to select digital pictures already stored on your computer and copy them onto the device . no need to mess around with memory cards - although the device accepts those as well if that works best for you . everyone who has seen ours loves it . it looks great and the picture quality and size are excellent
1	i bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it . it has all the basic functions her older coolpix had abut more and they 're a bit more user friendly . pros : compact and easy to hold . i 've had a few other point and shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand . this one feels pretty good . cons : before buying i read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be . i will agree . that is the cameras only real big down fall . though my girlfriend may not notice it so much , to me it 's a little more aparant . for the most part , overall i really like this little guy..
0	... unless you want to have trouble focusing , have difficulty using them indoors at a sporting event , or have the neck strap bracket break off , etc . i wear glasses and these never did focus well for me . i was not happy when the bracket broke off the day i received them , just as i was to leave for an africa safari vacation . the biocs kept slipping off my neck the whole trip , and it was frustrating . even more frustrating was trying to get them repaired . suposedly there is a warranty on these . hah ! when i sent them to bushnell for repair , they wanted [ ... ]
0	i ordered this product from amazon.com and when it arrived i fully charged the batteries . when i went to use them they were dead . i charged them again and when i went to use them a few days later the batteries were dead again ! i want my money back
1	i 'm not a professional but this lens makes me feel like one . it is a very versatile lens , working well inside or out , low light or extremely bright . am looking forward to taking sporting pictures next spring
0	i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod . come to find out , this model does not have a fluid head , meaning , if you do any panning with a camcorder , it wo n't be as smooth as you 'd probably like it to be . also , at the end of a pan the head tends to `` unwind , '' causing your panned image to back up a little ways . thus , i think it 's rather misleading to label this as a `` photo / video '' tripod . additionally , i do n't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters . finally , mine came with a few , very minor cosmetic blemishes , almost as if it were used . instead of video , i 'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount . if you want to do video , please buy a tripod with a fluid head . you 'll love it , i guarantee that . that 's why i give this one 2 stars
0	i have owned several digital cameras , and this is my current digital camera in hands . i would write a short review as a critical person with concentration only on important things to watch for . pros - uses only 2 aa batteries . - battery life is very good . - small camera size . easily fits into a pocket . - can set '+ ' flash level , which forces camera to make a stronger flash . i use it almost every time . cons - resolution . the images are not sharp in terms of that you ca n't distinguish individual pixels when looking at the real size picture . i would say , there is no much difference in quality between 4 mp and 50 % ( 1 mp ) scaled down version . the same problem exists in sony dsc w1 camera . - i had many problems with `` on '' button . sometimes camera refuses to turn on . it can be fixed by shaking camera and trying again . ( it could be a defect in my camera only ) . - some camera parts are painted plastic , which can be scratched . - camera can lose all settings and preferences if left with discharged batteries ( ~several hours ) or without them at all ( 10 minutes ) . - video quality 640x480 is pretty good in high quality mode , but eats flash space very quickly . windows 2000 did n't have the right codec to view the file . i had to install it by myself . - camera is performing slightly below the average in low lighting condition with auto settings
1	i had a chance to compare it with a tokina glass . canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion , same or even slightly worse on a sharpness , and complete looser on a build quality . if you are ok with 12mm - get tokina
0	the camera worked fine ; however , after six months , it stopped working . i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism . my use was in no way abusive . i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage , until i gave it away . i guess i should have stayed with canon . i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight , but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it
0	should have listened to the reviewer before me . unit arrived dead . neither ac power or car charger worked . tried replacing the 4 batteries that came with it with my other known batteries and unit still did not work
1	this is a nice bag , but do n't buy it for a canon s2 is it will not fit . the product compatibility lists the s1 is since the s2 and s1 are very similar i purchased this bag . i ca n't even get the thing in the bag . it is a nice bag however and have put my smaller kodak camera in it . there is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it 's accessories . good quality
0	my cheap 10x50 rugged exposure brand binoculars give me a better view . the rubber eye cups did not stay folded back for use with my glasses and i could n't get my glasses close enough to eleviate the round `` binocular effect '' . i did a side-by-side comparison with my cheap binocs and liked the cheap ones better - my vision is not that bad either . maybe with perfect vision they would work for , but i doubt it
1	i just got back from vacation . i have a bad back , and it was sore . i was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs , i could carry my nikon d-70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably . gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses . i have other bags which heft lots of gear , and they 're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot , but if you 're looking to hike ( and have a separate way to carry a tripod ) , then this is a wonderful bag
1	i 've owned the p-73 for about two years now . one thing i 'm noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews , is that after a year or so , the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely . for me , this has n't happened with this camera . it 's always been great , and it has a lot of really convenient features . when i bought this camera , i knew nothing about cameras . i just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was pretty . i got really lucky -- i mean , i only bought it because it was pretty -- i knew nothing about it . but , nonetheless , i got lucky and bought this camera that takes aa batteries , came with a battery charger and its own usb cord . it had a ton of settings on it . now that i understand more about photography , i really like the manual setting -- the slowest shutter speed is 30 seconds compared to 10-15 seconds of even newer cameras in its class . like i said , i never had any problems with it . batteries always lasted long ; took little time to recharge . i never even bought a memory card for this camera -- i use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that 's all the given memory card can hold , and my pictures are still decent quality . i 'm now looking into a new camera because i do want excellent image quality , and , ironically , ever since i 've been shopping for a new digital camera , my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about 20 percent of the shots i take ; weird . anyway , if you 're looking to buy a sony digital camera , based on my experience with this one , i 'd recommend the brand
1	overall , i am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the canon a 710 is . this camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old hp 935 -- the old guy still worked fine , but was very slow and did n't handle low-light situations very well at all . i was also looking for a bigger zoom range . after weighing the options , i decided that the a 710 is was the way to go . pros : - uses standard aa batteries . invaluable when you 're on the go and need more juice . also , the battery life has been very good - i 'm using the same aa rechargables i used for over a year in my old camera , and i routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge . - huge lcd screen that does n't suck power . fast response , too . - digital zoom that actually helps ! because the camera is 7.1 mp and has an image stabilizer , i can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom . very impressed . - very wide range of available settings . you can customize almost any aspect of this camera , from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed/brightness to focus to ... . - big enough , and small enough . it will fit in my back pocket most of the time , but it 's big enough to remind me that it 's there before i sit down . - fast processing time . taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me -- my old hp took forever ! the fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly , and also jump to an image very quickly too . much better than previous canon models even . - memory backup battery . remembers what day it is , time it is , and what image you 're on -- even if you take the regular aa 's out . very useful . - fast start-up time . it 's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on , especially if you bypass the `` welcome '' image sound and screen . - cool features , like color swap and color select . also , there 's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer 's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera . the camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video , a nice touch . - you can change lenses and add filters very easily . cons : - as i mentioned earlier , one of the reasons i upgraded from the hp was to have better luck with low-light situations . i 've had the camera now for just over a month , and i still have n't figured out the best setting for clear , low-light photos -- something that was very easy to do with older canon models , say , the a 510 . as mentioned , there is a wide range of settings available , which can also be a negative if you do n't know quite what you 're looking for . - no `` action '' setting . similar to above , the one setting i miss the most from other canons is that action setting . this camera requires you to set it manually . - video file sizes . a typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 mb -- making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online . also takes up a good chunk of a 1mb memory card , really quickly . canon would have done better to use mpeg-4 here instead of avi . - similarly , the video quality does n't reflect the large file size in most cases , though the sound quality is very good . - the big lcd is great , but is very hard to see outside in the sun . it does have a backup optical viewfinder , but using that puts your nose up against that lcd and leaves a nice smudge on it if you 're not careful . - buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use , but that 's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time . - bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images -- i have to go back through the old hp software if i want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600 ! overall , as mentioned , the camera is a huge improvement from my old hp , and even with all of those little annoyances , i 'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog . it 's no slr , but it 's getting there . and , you certainly ca n't beat the price
1	i have enjoyed using my camera . i have been able to get some great pictures . the stabilization feature work well
0	straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality . plug into wall and does not work . after trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord , it finally powered on . after putting in a card , the pics were ok , passable . the mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more , and i was only playing very quiet jazz . this is not worth the money even though it is cheap . pay a little more and get one that is of better quality
1	just as advertised , very small , very useful , great video , great photos , just what i needed this is the second jvc camera i own and both satisfy my needs
0	cheaply made and ill-fitting , this `` deluxe '' case is n't worth half the price . there is no handle or wrist strap provided ; your camera 's strap becomes the carry handle . a small , snap-strap is provided , but i ca n't figure out what it 's for ... the snap is easily unfastened with light pressure , and i would n't trust it to hold the weight of the empty case , much less with the heft of a camera inside . do n't buy this item : amazon will not reimburse you for the return postage , because it 's not their fault you do n't like it ... and you will be returning it . save yourself the trouble .
0	i owned this sony for a single day before i returned it to amazon . first off , it records in mpeg2 format which is fairly compressed , and looks it once you upload to your computer . it is also not natively supported on the mac without a 20 $ additional quicktime mpeg2 plugin . which has to be converted before editing . which makes it a slow , tedious affair . also , the included software is , surprise , pc only . other problems , not computer related - the chroma shift in `` night mode '' is intense , making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly . i 'm not expectant of miracles in night modes , but it seems like a simple solution on the production side ( sony ) . the auto white balance could also use the same attention . like the previous reviewer pointed out , not a bad camera for the money if you 're not serious about editing and you 're using a pc . the lcd touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use . all in all , i would go for a canon
1	it is working well , and it is sturdy . i dropped on the ground when playing frisby , but nothing happened
1	i was looking specifically for the magic combination of an all-around video and still camera that was compact and built very solid that i can travel with easily . i have had this camera since dec 19th , 2006 . i had very bad luck with my previous camera , a canon elura that used minidvs . when it worked , the videos were great , but the cassette mechanism kept falling out of adjustment and failing on trips or gatherings , and i lost many unrecoverable moments ! i had an extended warranty and sent it back 3 times , but they were never able to fix it properly . perhaps this was an unusual lemon , but i did not want to take the chance again ! of the many media types , i 've been told the sd cards are the most durable and almost indestructable . i liked the idea of no moving parts for recording videos . in addition , i was tired of having a separate digital and video camera , and the technology has finally arrived to combine the two . for the non-professional camera person looking to catch candid home and travel shots and videos , i 've found this is to be a great little camera . it is amazingly small , and really will fit in a coat pocket . extremely solid , it is also a snap to use , yet still provides powerful manual override abilities . the camera turns on within a few seconds . the video colors are extremely natural and not oversaturated in any way , and the resolution very fine . the microphone works well , and of course there is no `` tape hiss '' since there is no tape . the still photos are of fair quality . i printed some at 8 x 10 and they looked decent : however , if very-high quality photos are what you are after this is not the camera for you . again , this is definitely for the snap-and-shoot-for-memories crowd , not for people who want to win photography awards . the miniscule pop-up flash is amazingly powerful . i also looked at the sanyo which has a competing sd model with a higher still photo resolution ability , but it does not have any motion compensation ability . given how small these cameras are , it is not possible to hand-hold without jiggling it a lot , so i ruled the sanyo out . okay , now the negatives . there are quite a few , but for what it does i still found this to be the best camera for my purposes : ( 1 ) the camera does not record well in low-light conditions , i 'm sure due to the light required for 3ccd color processing and the small size of the lens ( cost of being compact ! ) . filming indoors requires pretty good light to ensure decent videos . my christmas tree light pictures were disappointing , and my backlit scenes came out looking like shadow-puppet plays . ( 2 ) the cost of buying additional 4gb cards is high , and i am worried about misplacing them because they are so small . ( 3 ) i experienced wide swings in over- and under-exposed still photos using the flash , although i was ( usually ) able to balance the brightness and contrast with my photo editor . i 'm sure this is partly due to not being used to the camera yet , but the whole idea is not to have to worry about such things . flash fill-in on backlit subjects works amazingly well . ( 4 ) the lcd display on the camera is not synchronized to the same level of brightness and contrast as your tv set or your pc , which you will have to adjust upwards during playback . thankfully , my sony tv allows custom adjustments for each input source . ditto when you are creating dvd 's ... you will need to increase the brightness and contrast to match what you see when playing back a scene through the camera 's own lcd viewer . ( 5 ) there is no still photo zoom playback on the camera ( at least i have not found it yet ) . frequently , i think a snapped photo comes out okay , only to realize when `` zooming '' the image on the pc to review the details that it is slightly blurry and i need to retake it . ( 6 ) you will need to use the included software to view the mpeg2 videos , as mpeg2 is not an included driver in the editing tools i 've reviewed . ( 7 ) there was no still photo editing software included , only video software . i supposed panasonic assumes everyone has their own photo editing software already , but i did n't . my canon photo editing software works for these photos , so i am using that . ( 8 ) finally , the battery fits inside an enclosed compartment , so you are not able to buy an extended battery pack . since there is no energy required for running a hard drive , dvd burner or tape , admittedly the batteries seem to last longer before recharging , but i still ca n't see taking a trip with less than 2-3 packs . i guess i will be spending extra on more batteries ! even with these drawbacks , there is no doubt that this is an amazing sleek winner with really no competitor in its class that i intend to use heavily at home and on my travels
0	overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your panasonic lx1 or lx2 camera , but it has a few major flaws . first , there is no simple way to attach it to your belt . there is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it wo n't fit any belt more than 1/2 '' wide . also , there are two zippers on this case , one on each side , which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket . finally , the velcro tab that closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own . this might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase , but not for carrying around for everyday use .
1	as a novice astronomer i really enjoy the sharp , steady view with these binoculars . the view is fairly steady even with the i.s . off - depending how stable you are of course . my binoculars cost more than my telescope ! ! and my telescope is a decent one too . but i think they are worth it . you see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see - by far . they are of course great during the day too . their weight is not much of an issue for me , although each person is different depending on their viewing habits . i think a hard carry case would have been the best but it 's not a big deal for my use . i recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance
0	looks nice . unfortunately did not power up the camera , so i ca n't say much else . going to cost me return shipping at the very least . sorry i did n't buy the canon product instead
1	after buying this camera i was pleased for the most part , as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good . it 's a sleek , smooth design with minimal buttons , thus little confusion . there are 3 things , however , that i 'm not happy with . one is that it takes double a batteries , and eats them up really fast . the second thing is that there 's no secondary viewfinder , just the lcd screen . the lcd screen is large , which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low . you ca n't turn the lcd screen off , so batteries go fast . the third and final thing i dislike about it is that there 's no ac adaptor , so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the tv , not using it to take pictures , you have to run it on batteries . that is , unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt ac plug , which is neither on the vivitar website , or anywhere else online that i can find made specifically for this camera . i 'm a little upset that it came with no adapter , as that would be so useful for a camera that eats up batteries . i reccomend rechargibles if you 're going to get this camera
0	just for the record , my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier casio models . presently in iraq , i do want to have a camera with me , but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service . sad . it looked to be a great camera
1	i bought this for my wife so she could pull out the camera , turn it on , and take a nice photo . flash works well , unlike some reviews i 've read . battery life appears to be fine also . this is a small , light camera , measuring 3 1/2 '' wide , 2 1/4 `` tall , and 3/4 '' deep when turned off . not exactly a credit card , but likely as close to one as you 're gon na get . camera opens up instantly , takes a nice photo whether with or without flash , battery life appears ok , and controls are easy to use -- either in figuring them out or using your fingers on them . nice big screen 2 1/4 by 1 1/2 , so you can easily see what 's going on -- a nice plus . this camera also has a nice `` reminder '' listing on the right of the display , so you can see flash setting ( on , off , etc . ) , iso setting for those of you that use that , and very nice way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus , self-timer , antishake , iso sensitivity , white background ( am i losing you yet ? ) , and so on . one point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most-likely-to-use to least-likely , so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera . i 've gotten some nice pictures with this , with and without flash . a nice pick . why not 5 stars ? cuz i 've also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices , although for the price this camera is fine and it 'd be one i 'd buy again , but it is n't the equal of dig cams with 6x optical zooms , separate iso settings , and all those other techie things that , frankly , are n't that important to a lot of users but which do need to be considered in a rating . do buy a carrying case , as i have done , so the camera does n't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small . i do n't have any `` special fear '' about this but it 's also easy to buy a small carrying case to stash this into , so why not do it ? as in all my reviews , i have no financial interest one way or the other in what i review . also , do n't forget you are likely to want a bigger memory card to store pix , and maybe a second battery to swap out when needed . consider these additional costs , but also consider these additional costs apply to any camera you buy .
0	very dissappointed . my son ( i bought this for them ) hooked it up and there is so much interference it can not be used . audio just static and noise . i did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might not work . try telling this to me before i purchase thank you . this is the last i purchase equipment on-line . i will stick to books thank you very much
0	i recently ordered a kodak camera from amazon.com . with that i also ordered this battery the camera bag . everything was delivered as expected , except the camera . over 2 weeks later i was notified the camera is not available . now i 'm stuck with a battery camera bag that i ca n't return because they came from another seller . the camera i bought from a different seller came with the bag uses a different battery . now i 'm out the cost of the battery , the bag the shipping charges ! thanks a lot
0	if you want to load directly from your camera 's memory card the system takes forever to copy photos to the internal card . there is no `` copy all '' function . loading information from a computer did n't work . the usb connection was not recognized by windows xp and i could n't find any drivers on the web . a setup cd would be a nice addition . btw the screen was not as large as one might think . it is very wide but not tall and it crops the top bottom of most pictures making it great for shots of the grand canyon but not for portraits of people
1	i absolutely love this camera . i 've told everyone i know to buy it . the picture quality is amazing . there are so many options with this tiny little camera ! you can edit pictures before you even print them . zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way , and so much more . i take pictures of everything ! i charged the battery when i got the camera , which was about three weeks ago , and it 's still going . i have 7/8th of battery life left . i have n't had to charge it again . i am so happy with my purchase ! i hope this helps you
0	i purchased this camera after reading reviews and tech specs about the camera . it 's either not enough , or it 's too much ... i 'm not sure which . i returned it and purchased a 10 megapixel powershot a640 which has a swiveling view finder ( which is great ! ) and will suit my needs just fine for about $ 200 less .
0	for nearly $ 100 , this adaptor provides very little ( 1.5x ) magnification . it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly . this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor , which is used infrequently by me , but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance . it is lightweight , but cumbersome and does n't accept filters . for real telephoto capabilities , get an slr with interchangeable lenses . i sent this product back .
1	i love the new digital canon . the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin . i had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working . the canon people have been great , and very helpful , but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory . the photos , however , are wonderful . film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable . ( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it , so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos .
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera . the camera does not come close to fitting in this case . the camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case .
0	it 's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs -- this hood . how can you pay $ 75 for a great prime lens , and $ 25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it
1	great product . good value . maybe a little slow for focusing , compared to my old 18-55mm canon lens . good quality pictures . great all in one lens
0	i was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood . given that the cost is about 10 % of the cost of the lens for which it was intended ( the 70-300 is in this case ) i expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate . -positives- fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare , etc . the bayonet locking system is excellent , much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods . that 's about it . -negatives- the polycarbonate is so thin i half expect it to be translucent . the hood must be gripped by the base to remove it , as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it ; or at least it feels like it may break it . its very long . especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens , this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long . that 's pretty conspicuous . it 's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ( $ 50 vs. $ 5-10 for rubber or metal ) . i traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood . 2 stars for the great bayonet design , but the rest of it is weak
0	panasonic offers a usb driver however no video driver . this means that anyone using windows xp will be unable to transfer video to their computer . when talking to panasonic they just said they didnt have a driver and were not developing one . they offered no suggestions or alternatives
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit . the glass itself was intact , but something underneath was clearly broken . mailed it in to the factory service company for sony , and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost $ 181 to repair . this is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially . i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera .
1	this is a replacement for an identical battery pack that i lost . works great , long life , no problems
0	i read all the reviews and comments on this kodak printer i could find . many gave glowing reviews . i 'd just purchased a new kodak digital camera , and thought this printer dock would make a perfect setup . i was never able to get the printer to perform as kodak says it should . it caused some odd conflict , and my computer would not boot into windows xp with the printer attached to the computer . i ended up having to disconnect the printer , turn on my computer , and then reconnect the printer in order to use it . windows then had to always reinstall the printer drivers . it was made even more frustrating by kodak 's tech support . i called and emailed multiple times for assistance . in one conversation i was literally told `` i do n't know what 's wrong and ca n't help you . '' now that 's tech support ! finally the printer refused to print telling me that it was out of paper . i tried all kodak 's remedies , none worked . no matter how much or how little paper was in the machine , it said there was no paper . i even opened a fresh pack to find it still fussy and not let me print . i ca n't recommend this printer . i could give a better recommendation had kodak itself , through its tech support , at least have provided my with some competent assistance . i got about 2 dozen prints , quite a large cost for printer and supplies for a few prints before the machine just failed to work at all . about the only positive i can give is that the prints i did get looked good , the color was nice . i gave it an extra star for print quality alone . kodak was a name that had some strength behind the name once upon a time . it was synonymous with home photography once upon a time . they 've lost something over the years , and that is quality
0	i got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message . i now find out that was a design flaw . anyway , i spent hundreds of dollars on this one , and now , just over a year after i got it , it wo n't hold a battery charge . i loved both cameras while they worked , but i ca n't afford a $ 400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so . i 've written to canon tech support . unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge , i 'm moving on to another brand camera
0	i received this filter and it had been used , seals were open and case that holds filters cracked , piece of plastic floating loose inside , smug marks on it . i was shocked , i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this .
1	i purchase this on december 2006 i have other 10x50 binocular but when i look at sky through this binox..it 's amazing ! ! ! i recommend it for astronomy and birding trip..
0	this is my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports . after a few months of ok pictures ( the macro setting is not very good though ) the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it . i would manually open up the lens cover each time . then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that . but now the camera is almost completely dead . it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps . i 'm not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this . i will not buy another canon camera . this camera was made too cheaply . i wish things were not made to break right away
0	this is a complete waste of money . ( 1 ) it 's clunky and hard to carry around . ( 2 ) not really a good value for money based on the mp 's it offers . i would recommend you spend the add'l $ 50 and get a nicer camera ! this one is crap
0	i own many sony products , including a sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed by this camera , the sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present . it is small , lightweight , portable ; easy to use ; and stylish . it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months of use , a few problems have become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there is horrible red-eye ( and white-eye ) artifact in many pictures . the so-called `` red-eye reduction '' setting does nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography is very grainy , with lots of noise . night-time photography is impossible . these problems are not unique to our camera ... you will find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed in this camera , and wish i could exchange it for something else . do not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( and they are still small pocket-size cameras ) .
1	i going to write the for non techs out there ... i can use it , my wife can use it , my mom can use it and my 5 year old son can use it . it is just that simple to use . you do not need to know anything about taking shots , other than how to zoom and pick the right settings , and if you play with the camera for a few days you will know them . one other reviewer said to get the following : 1 . at least a 512 mb memory stick pro duo to take 160 or so pictures in one go 2 . rechargeable aa batteries and a charger 3 . case and i must say yes , yes and yes ... to all , they are a must ... this camera , feels good in your hands , screen size is great . you can see the screen in both sunlight and at nights . the menu is very easy to follow and the quality of the picture are clean and clear . i ca n't comment on the software that comes with the camera as i have a apple computer and i use iphoto . for the price , i felt like i got a $ [ ... ] sony ...
0	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times . last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed . i have n't changed anything or done anything . i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera , but given the price i 'm pretty annoyed and amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days
1	i 've used all types of film thoughout my photography days and by far kodaks treated me the best . if your out to capture rich , vibrant colors this is the film for you . so far i 've shot 4 rolls of it and i 'm amazed at how much the colors stand out . its definatly the film i 'll be using
0	even though amazon specifically recommended this bag for the panasonic lumix ( dmc-fz20pp ) camera , and even though i had to return it because it was too small , and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer 's review , amazon annoyingly continues to recommend this bag for my camera . to add insult to injury , amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault . ( it took two emails to get the full refund , and that was even after i put a large message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh ! ) regarding the bag itself , construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories
0	this item does not charge your camera . it does provide power to your camera while plugged in , but it does not recharge your camera 's battery
1	i used the product at victoris falls and was very pleased . at this time i have not gone under water with it .
0	ordered one new from b in the 1x mode the top light came on , no worries . turned on the bottom setting of the switch , 2x , nothing . neither light came on . pitiful . sending it back
0	i am not impressed with tiffen filters i got in this set . the finish of the rings are poor . despite of previously poor reputaion , i recently purchased some 67mm quantaray filter from the local ritz camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of tiffen filters . i never got tiffens before , had good experience with hoyas . i will probably stay with those from now on . now come to think of it , ritz camera indicated the quantaray they had were made by hoya . the glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the hoyas and the quantarays . not a good sign . the circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off . quite frustrating . all of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them , not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame , but none of the other filters i got before had this kind of problem right out of the box . the set might be cheap , but it sure is for a good reason
1	this case is so well made , and just the right size to give the canon elura , a nice snug paddeded cushioned fit . plus secondary compartments for all the accessiories that you need to carry for your video photography ... ... .
0	i got mine today , and it is being returned today . i had high hopes , given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity . i was hoping for an all-in-one device for stills and video . here 's my results : 1 ) stills . pictures are not too bad , but do not compare with a similar 7mp canon sd500 which i own . the zoom works well , focusing is ok , but slow . the pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them , flash or not , like they are all taken at a high iso setting on a regular digital cam . so slight disappointment here . 2 ) video . if this is improved low light sensitivity , i would not have liked to see the results on the hd1 ! video does not even come close to comparing to my regular sony dv camera . focusing is hit or miss , and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my sony . i really was hoping for the be all end all combo device , but the hd2 does neither very well . ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well . the finish is great and the buttons are well placed . but it does n't justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves
1	i received the tripod ahead of the expected schedule . i 've been looking at tripods in stores in and around the greater boston area . you ca n't get a better tripod for the money . in fact , you ca n't get anything `` decent '' for under $ 40-50 and even then i 'm not sure you will get something this good . i had it shipped to my job and a few guys in the office ( which i did n't know ) had purchased a tripod in the past and where really impressed when i told them i only paid $ 25 for it . conclusion : is the tripod perfect , no . the head looks a little like plastic . but it has nice rubber feet and rubber grip in addition to everything listed on the website . this tripod is perfect for the beginner to enthusiast photographer .
1	this item worked , allowed me to use printer and docking station from another kodak camera . would do it agai
1	because of it 's non-intrusive red lighting , and especially because of its size and brightness control , this is the perfect little light to bring out in to the field for observing . one caution ; make sure you have the lanyard securely around your wrist , especially if you 're shining the light down a tube to collimate . one slip , and it 'll be headed toward your primary
1	i purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera . this is my second point and shoot digital camera since i have abandoned film . it is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures . it has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me . i have used it on an entire week long vacation without re-charging it . kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less
1	outstanding camera in every respect . i 've owned several digital cameras in recent years ( sony nikon ) . the n2 's giant 3 '' lcd , the touch screen features , lens optics , and overall ease of use top any of my previous cameras . i use it for both land and underwater photography and it performs flawlessly . good job sony
1	i needed a lens hood for my 50mm lens and paying $ 25 for a hood on a $ 75 lens might seem ridiculous . however , that might be because the $ 75 lens is so inexpensive . if the lens was $ 250 then paying an extra 10 % might not seem too bad . i just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for $ 100 and that 's good for a terrific prime lens and its hood . however , please note : the lens hood is rather shallow ( 1 star reduction ) and it is a screw-on two piece kit ( 1 star reduction ) . one piece is the adaptor that screws-on where the filters normally go ( uv filter ) in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor . the adaptor ring retains the same 52mm rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor . ( 1 bonus star ) because $ 100 is still a bargain for a 50mm , f1.8 , super fast , super sharp , super clear , light weight beginner lens and hood kit ! i hope this helps rather than confuse . : )
1	proving that there 's life in the old dog yet , bushnell have come up with this , the successor to the out-dated , poor-performing trophy splashproof spotting scope , and i have to say , it 's a fantastic improvement . as soon as i took it out of the box i was impressed with its styling , shape , colour , and of course , waterproofness . i set it up in my front room and spent a happy couple of hours watching my neighbours coming and going , and they were oblivious to my surveillance . it 's not the most subtle 'scope out there but stick a blanket over your head and you 're laughing . any one who has been caught out in the rain will appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing , as water really does roll off it like , erm , water off a duck 's back . stunning
1	15 years of photography experience here ... the sigma 15mm fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites ( go ahead and search ) and this is a very good product . the canon has a tighter focus and a *touch* faster in focusing , but with the massive depth of field with this lens , it 's not a problem at all . be aware that if you use this on a 1.6 crop factor digital slr that has aps sensors like my 20d or digital rebel , then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or 1.3 or full frame digital slrs . watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also ... but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses . this is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more . if you search around , you can find much lower prices on this lens
1	works better than i could have hoped . i have used it for about a month and it is very simple to execute -- but you have to be able to hold somewhat steady which is not a problem for me . if you are someone who has the shakes -- may be a problem . i have compared the accuracy to gps devices with guys playing with me . this is better since it gives you the actual yardage to the pin . also , you can get yardage to another golfer in the field , and yardage to any object , bunker , tree etc. , which the gps ca n't . a lot of courses are not marked correctly , and , of course , yardage changes depending on how far off to the side of the fairway -- or even out of the fairway -- you are . this is where it is especially nice . there are times when without this device you are just flat out guessing . this is an awesome piece of technology . it was well worth the price for me .
0	i returned this item . i have not received notice that they did receive it back so i will have to wait and see if my credit card account is credited
0	i bought this camera because i 'm going to jamaica and i needed a camera , the video camera was a bonus . when i first tested it , it was during the night time , however in a well lit room , but i could n't see anything . i figured i could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day . when i stepped outside , which was very bright and sunny , all i could see on the screen was white . i tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen . the only time i actually saw anything on my screen was when i was inside during the day . i brought it back right away , thankfully i had bought it at wal-mart and they were happy to refund my money . i hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera . i would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option
1	it was time to upgrade my 2.0 mp canon powershot s200 which is more than three years old ( ancient in a digital world ) to a camera which takes higher quality pictures . the newer canon cameras had a larger screen , but it was basically the same camera . after a month , i am still pleased that i purchased the nikon coolpix s6 : + push button to switch between camera versus play modes ( versus a toggle slide which is hard on the nails ) + easy-to-navigate mode and menu options with flywheel like an ipod + no telescopic lens = no annoying zoom sound during focus , on/off , less wear-and-tear on the most vulnerable component
1	after owning and using the camera for a month or so now , i am delighted with it . i have only replaced the batteries one time , so do n't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for . small lightweight , many features . choice of 6 meg , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , and 1 meg photos at fingertips . what i really decided on this camera for was the macro capability as i take photos of very small coins , and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that . it preforms magnificantly . my previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle . i love the samsung digimax s600 .
0	i just got this printer dock with a camera , and the printer feature is a real pain ! the paper will almost never feed no matter what i 've tried . when it does feed , it ends up jamming . i only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone . i 'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back
1	the case with battery and filter is well worth thr price paid
0	i bougt this camera because i had had a sony coolpix 3 , which took great pictures . with this camera , you can never get it adjusted right . if you use the flash the pictures are to light , if you dont they are too dark . it is a constant battle with this little cute camera . worse camera purchase i ever made .
0	this is a poorly designed camera case . you have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures . i expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot . i was very disappointed . this is rather a leather box than a camera case
1	this tripod was a total shock ! i was amazed at the quality , stability and portability . the heavy duty denier carrying case is a great bonus . the level and quick release were also a welcome surprise . this was the best $ 9.00 i ever spent for photography accessories .
0	i loved the camera , absolutely loved it . i was using it one night and it died . i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened . the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying . the second time i used it , i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger . i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures . as i was looking at the pictures , it just shut off . i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose . i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine .
0	i found the product to be made very poorly ... .all it too is one drop on the floor and the camera battery door cracked and that was is for the camera too ... .not a kid friendly camera at all
1	this camera is perfect for me i have a [ ... ] an a [ ... ] an it always seems there doing something ide like to catch on film . this camcorder is small enough that some days i have it in my jacket pocket an the instant on makes it really easy to catch them moments that are usually gone by the time you get them big cameras out of the bag an ready to go . also it can extract a still picture out of a video clip so them candid shots are never missed . the settings for this camera are really easy to understand an use . it takes really good video 's an pictures although ive not taken alot of still pictures because i like to extract that perfect picture out of a video clip . this camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc . ive got a few 2 gig cards so ive always have one in the camera ready to go . the battery does not last a long time so i recommend a couple extra , there pretty cheep here on amazon an it usually takes one battery to download onto pc if you have it hooked up to your pc for any lengh of time . i dont know anything about camera 's an how they work i just like to take the pictures an so far this has been the easiest camera /camcorder ive seen
0	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times . last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed . i have n't changed anything or done anything . i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera , but given the price i 'm pretty annoyed and amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days
0	i 've had this battery for half a year and i agree with a fellow reviewer 's assessment that the battery does not hold much power . i am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory , but this delkin model 's life span was noticeably short . now i am going to buy a new charger/battery altogether because i do n't want to buy another delkin battery
0	this monitor worked pretty well for 4 months . we purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver . however , when we were downstairs ( baby 's room upstairs next to our 's ) the monitor was fuzzy , and had static and lines running thru . we were still able to have audio recpetion . after 4 months , the picture disappeared , audio was still operational . not a good camera for long term
1	this is a camcorder for the digital age . tiny , multi-functional , and flexible . no ancient-technology magnetic tape . as with any product on the leading edge , there are many shortcomings . let 's dispense with the obvious . this device is all about compact go-anywhere flexibility and ease . for best image quality , a dedicated mini-dv camcorder and dedicated digital still camera is the only way to go . in fact , buying a separate camcorder and still camera may likely be less expensive than the sanyo c6 while resulting in superior quality . overall image quality is best described as `` ok '' . the poor lens zoom and aperture is more befitting a $ 100 digital camera than a $ 400 device . the flash is weak and will not light many scenes that any other still camera would light . in addition , since the flash is not offset in any way from the lens , red-eye is virtually guaranteed at any range . this is not a problem with digital touch-up being common practice , but plan on touching up more often . low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically in video mode . virtually any digital camcorder at any price will outperform this sanyo in video mode in any situation , but a little day light goes a long way towards improving video quality with the xacti c6 . also , to be clear , the video quality is still superior to anything seen in the best of analog camcorders . for all these negatives , the convenience can be truly revolutionary . one can wear the tiny vpc-c6 around the neck all day . this causes an amazing change in attitude towards video . since the sanyo is so compact , no one would think twice about bringing it along on any minor travel . being freed from the chore of `` packing up '' a camcorder means a corresponding willingness to bring the sanyo on so many more occasions , such as a visit to the park instead of just weddings and birthday parties . and whereas a mini-dv camcorder requires one hour to transfer one hour 's worth of video to your computer , the sanyo transfers video as fast as the sd card and usb 2.0 interface will allow . that means five minutes or less to transfer one hour 's worth of video to a computer . this ease increases willingess to create video and share video . no more procrastination over dragging out the camcorder wiring and the manual task of initiating video transfer to a computer . with the sanyo , just place the camera in the docking station and pictures and video files are available just like files on a usb flash drive . it is difficult to overestate the significance of this convenience . video becomes an everyday pleasure , if one so wishes , rather than a special occasion chore . if one values this convenience over absolute image quality , this is the product to own . this is a leading edge product . to get the most of this product , i highly recommend doing the following : 1 ) sanyo has provided an updated firmware on their website . this fixes a fatal flaw in the audio processing that some people have noted as excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive with other camcorders . in addition , this firmware update adds compatability with 4gb sd cards ( the limit is 2gb without the update ) . kudos to sanyo for the continuing support . ( note that the instructions are a littled distorted in the translation - what they meant to write is that you need to push the set button to the left to enter the firmware update screen . ) 2 ) the video is in mp4 format and is playable only with quicktime . for windows users , this limits video editing to the included programs or quicktime-specific programs . there is an easy solution . first , download the divx codec ( a freeware commercial product ) or xvid codec ( a free open source product - my preference ) or ffdshow ( a free open source product ) - use your search engine of choice to find these . second , download a utility called `` mp4cam2avi '' ( a free open source software found easily with your search engine of choice ) . with these two programs , the video becomes compatable with any windows program , including just about any media player ( such as windows media player ) and any video editing tool ( such as windows movie maker ) . i look forward to seeing how this market segment evolves . the freedom from bulk and digital tedium is addicting and i am sure the image quality will continue to improve . for now , i am happy capturing the memories that would have otherwise been lost had i continued to own a conventional bulky tape-based camcorder
1	hi have a rebel extreme , and needed to use the high-speed mode ... but the flash could n't even vaguely keep up . i was taking pictures of dancers , so needed a flash system that could keep up . the speedlite really does this perfectly - i 'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos , and this flash system is there each time . i do n't know if it really helps when taking a single photo , but if you want a flash that can keep up , this one is great ! i like it so much , i 'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot , to run in slave mode with this one .
1	i purchased this camera for my son . he is a doctoral student and needed to photograph items for his research . he was able to learn to use it quickly . the battery life is phenomenal
1	the enclosure has a solid feel to it . i dove with it three times with no problem at all . it would be nice if the weight does not cost extra . the only compliant i have is that the enclosure is a tight fit , so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure
0	i have an r717 camera . i bought the dock too . each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical . hp labels both as an r07 battery but the l1812a has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera . the other battery is the l1812b and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera . i bought a `` clone '' battery ( not hp ) and its edges are rounded too . maybe hp could explain the difference . just thought you would like to know
1	this is one fantastic flash . i had it on my canon a2e for four years , and was ambivilent , but if you match this lens with one of canon 's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550ex 's features , you have an awesome , powerful , flexable flash that can change the way you shoot
0	yes , it does provide a bit more eye relief , and can make it easier to see the whole frame ( by making it smaller ) , but there is a major problem with this . the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this , and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you . this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses .
1	bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting . easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights , with the crank , make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope , no matter how tall they are . compact and lite to carry , makes it easy to transport to and from the range
1	this lens does exactly what it should . the overall quality is extremely good . take a look at my photos : - first photo is without the lens - second photo is with the lens and flash - third photo is with the lens and without flash there are a few things to note about the photos : - there is a substantial amount of barrel distortion . this is normal . try not to have straight lines near the borders of the photo to make it less obvious . - fringing is exaggerated . you notice fringing ( purple or blue tints ) along high contrast edges of objects that are near the borders . you can see this on regular shots but is more exaggerated with the wide angle lens . - the lens makes a shadow when using the built-in flash . you can see the shadow in the photo with the flash . in a darker environment , it is very obvious . the external flash is the only way to fix this . a couple details : - you can get an extender that is a nice brushed aluminum here : http : //www.lensmateonline.com/s2.html - the camera has a setting ( converter ) to indicate that you have the lens attached . it 's not obvious what it does but it is indicated by a change in the image stabilization icon so i assume that it affects the way that image stabilization works . overall , i recommend this lens
1	the case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only . then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses . it makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera . you can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack . my digital rebel xt fits with the canon battery grip and my macro lens attached , however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached . my canon speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag . the lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them . i bought a regular lowepro camera bag , but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached . this bag is designed to have the camera with a lens . if you search google images for the lowepro slingshot 200 you will see what i mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal .
1	despite reading glowing reviews about this lens , i was still surprised to see how well it performed . the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes , from a distance of three quarters of a football field away , shooting hand held , with late afternoon light , which will print a 5x7 and still look like a pro took them ! if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and ca n't afford , or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures , then you should give this lens your serious consideration .
1	the optical x6 zoom on the canon a710 is is already better than cameras in it s range ( i.e . non slr ) . however , the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size ; the tele converter lens really does make a difference . firstly , if there are any negatives , they are very minor ; the lens and adapter are black - would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera . erm , that 's it ! the main quality of canon is the lens , which they always do well . the clarity of this lens is very good , with very little fuzziness at the edge . it also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected . the electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment . the tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want .
1	i received one of these for christmas ... so i 've had it for 6 months now . i 've taken thousands of shots with it , on both a canon digital rebel xt ( 350d ) and a canon eos 20d . the bottom line ... i really like the lens . although you must learn to to optimize its use at 200mm . specifics ... 1 ) at 200mm ( max telephoto ) , you will see some blur if you do n't use a high shutter speed and hold it steady . this means that just placing your camera on the green `` point and shoot '' mode , or even `` p '' mode may not give you a fast enough shutter speed to keep from having blur unless you are in bright daylight . so ... .here 's my technique : at 200mm you may want to bump up your iso ( film ) speed to 400 or 800 , then use tv mode ( canon settings i 'm talking about - manual shutter speed control ) to get a fast shutter speed . i also hold the end of the lens ( the petal filter ) with my left hand and lean against a solid object or have a good foot stance - or use a tripod . all of this is not any sort of lens defect ; rather , it is typical of using a long tele lens that does not have image stabilization ( is ) . you can get is from canon , but be ready to lay down some $ $ $ and carry multiple lenses ... more on that later . 2 ) noisy autofocus . yeah , true , it is louder than other lenses , but so what . it is not any louder than the fake autowinder sound my rebel xt makes . i find its focus quick and accurate - except in low light . although , i will say my 20d does much better than my 350d did with this lens in low light . but , honestly , i do n't think the low light autofocus is any worse than the canon 18-55 kit lens i initially ised . it hunted a lot too in low light , and often would not lock - necessitating manual focus . perhaps it is the camera , not the lens . regardless , manual focus on the sigma works great in low light , or , to keep autofocus , you can use an external flash for ir focus assist and it locks right up . other than the tamron , you will not find as versatile a lens as this one , especially at this price point . optical quality is great on my lens . you can do better - but with two lenses . my solution to have this kind of range if $ $ $ was no object would be the canon ef-s 17-85mm f4-5.6 is usm and the canon ef 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 do is usm ... this would add image stabilization and 100mms more range , but at much more cost , and you would have to carry two lenses . i specifically bought this lens to have a compact , one lens solution . if you read all the reviews you can find , the general consensus is that the sigma is better than the tamron 18-200 . plus , the end barrel does not rotate , so you can use a circular polarizer . show me a lens that has better bang for the buck in a one lens solution , and i 'll buy it . until then , i love my sigma
0	was dropped onece and it broke . computer doe n't recongise software with windows xp . kids were disappointed they could n't see there pictures . called the company and they were no help
1	buy this cable through amazon and you wo n't be sorry . i looked all over the internet and its sometimes hard to find a good company online to buy through and after the manufacture was sold out these cables , a friend told me about amazon , i typed in the cable number and amazon had it in stock . i decided to order this and hope for the best well sure enough the cable arrived on time just like amazon said . i know have a great working usb cable for my digital camera . i order three since all my friends and family always ask to borrow mine and the fact that i need a replacement . if i had the money i would buy five of these . its the fact that me , my family , and friends are always misplacing are cables or losing them . so i order this cable through amazon . its nice to know if i lose my cables i can buy more . ever since i bought these cables i have been making sure i know where i put em . be happy and buy with no worries
0	gosh , i would really like to review this adapter , but -- - amazon has put my order on indefinate hold , as thier supplier is unable to get any more . but wait ! what 's that blurb on the product page - '' availability : ususally ships within 24 hours '' and `` want it delivered tomorrow ? order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes , and choose one-day shipping at checkout . see details . '' so they ca n't deliver it , yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow ? do n't order from amazon
0	i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months , but i was happy with the picture quality . i replaced it with the s5100 , it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 ( in particular shutter speed choices ) while on a trip to niagara falls , i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt ( and i mean slight ) after that it would n't power up . i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable .
0	use less than 3 times , the touch screen does n't work.do n't know why~
1	i had the tokina 12-24 f4 and it was a great sharp lens . this canon focuses faster and is wider . if you 're worried about full frame in the future do n't be . just buy this lens and enjoy the ultra wide images . it light , fast and sharp . `` l '' quality pictures . the build could be better but i do n't see any problems down the road .
0	i had this camera for about a month and the first time it broke , i do n't know why it broke . i set it down and when i turned it back on , it had cracked . i then bought another lcd screen and repaired it myself , but two weeks later , i had a case for it , and put it in my purse . i carried my purse around and had not set my purse down . when i took it out , it had cracked again . i would not recommend getting this camera
0	the leather case has a magnetc latch , the magnetic force is strong enough for an sd card to stick onto it . i have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire , but i decided not to chance it . i am surprised that canon cautions against placing the camera in strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature ! although constructed of fine leather , the case is also very bulky , making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse . the neck strap is ok , it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing , making it look quite cheap and stiff , again increasing the bulk of the camera . the battery works fine , but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money
0	it takes around 3-4 seconds to take the picture after i click the button ! ! and then another 8-10 seconds just to store that picture on the sd card ! ! so basically , i cant take another picture until atleast 10-15 seconds of one picture ! !
1	wow is all there is to say no problems with it perfect for a casual picture take
1	i use this gem on my 20d along with my 24-105mm , and as far as i 'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there . my 24-105 is n't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens ( although it is sharp , just not quite long enough ) the 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with is to boot ! the photos i 've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers . if you can afford it , do it , you wo n't regret i
0	i bought this camera for myself during christmas 2004 . it was suppose to be a utility camera , ebay items and class projects for the kids only -- i do n't trust digital cameras for family photos . the kodak cx7300 seemed to fit the bill ; inexpensive , easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp . the flaw in this camera did n't appear until i pulled it out of the drawer some months later . the camera would n't turn on . i checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape . i eventually tried replacing the batteries and , sure enough , that worked . the next time i took out the camera , the exact same thing happened . and the time after that . at first , i thought the cx7300 was eating the batteries . but eventually i came to the conclusion that the camera does n't eat batteries , it nibbles at them . it wo n't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries . the kodak batteries that came with the cx7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight , going strong . i contacted kodak about this flaw . they wanted to talk about what kind of batteries i 'm using -- kodak -- or the option of my purchasing a camera dock and some rechargeable batteries . a solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent . i thought that buying an optional ac adapter would be the simple , and cheap , solution . surprise , surprise , the cx7300 is one of the few digital cameras kodak makes that does n't take one . so , now that i 'm way past warranty , what do i do with it ? i 'm shopping for another camera
0	i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first . i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out . firstly , the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought . it still could have worked for my but for one thing : this bag is not designed for those with a , er ... ..womanly build . it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me . so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online . just a word of warning to the ladies ; -
1	the fisheye lens is a lot of fun , and i enjoy using mine . however , i find that the practicality of the lens is minimal . i do n't usually want my `` serious '' photographs to have fisheye distortion . i do n't tend to like the 1.6x crop on canon 's lower-end digital slr cameras , but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit : it 's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide-angle lens , since most of the distortion is removed by the 1.6x crop . you can still get distortion , but it 's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1.6x camera than a full-frame camera . either way , lots of fun . buy one for the enjoyment , or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it , but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these
1	i highly recommend the raynox dcr 1540pro teleconverter for the canon s2 instead of the canon branded one . hoya makes a 67mm uv filter for this and both are available at lensmate.com . the canon wc-dc58a wide angle converter however is really good . tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore . by the way , the function that the s2 provides for settings using the lens adaptors and teleconvertors are to adjust for the autofocus function of the camera and are necessary unless you wish to try to focus yourself using the manual focus which , in my mind , because of the lcd both in the screen as well as in the viewfinder with a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder , is iffy at best . trust the camera ... ..it really does an excellent job . one final note , i would recommend using the focus bracketing option in lower light situations as the auto focus is weak in those situations .
1	this is my 5th digital camera . it is the best i have used in this size camera
1	up front : if you 're considering this lens , stop considering - and buy it . i had occasion to try the tamaron zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the tamaron 's highlighted-texture areas . none of that is a problem with this canon beauty . i am using it as my normal lens . the contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with . it 's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a tv camera . it 's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical abs ... . tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges . and there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges . photoshop nails the latter dead'er than britney spears ' career . i 've had a need for reasonably large blow-ups , with most captures cropped , yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally 13x20 . at that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject 's pores , but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters .
1	i 've bought several lenses from adorama , two of which include a new 300/2.8 is and the other , this 500/4 is . all of their deliveries were prompt and well packed . i have zero complaints with them . i dealt the john ( green , i think is his last name ) via email . i highly recommend them . as for this lens , it is incredible . wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background ( good bokeh ) . af is very fast . this lens is extremely good and will still af when used with the 1.4x converter . ( af works up to f5.6 .
0	i bought this almost exactly 2 years ago , and i turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash , and the flash would not work . it was set to automatic flash . using the auto setting , i thought there used to be 3 flash settings ( auto , forced flash and no flash ) , but now there were only 2 . i took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash , and the flash went off outside ! something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused . thinking i hit something and changed a setting , i reset it to the factory defaults and it still does n't work . it will probably be too expensive to get it fixed , and it 's weird but i just upgraded to a nikon d50 . i must have known this camera was about to die . even when it worked , half the time pictures came out blurry . i either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed . maybe the camera was defective the entire time i had it . no more canons for me
1	i have not actually taken this underwater yet , but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases . it keeps the over-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a bc pocket . on the downside , it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons . you can zoom and telephoto , change from camera , playback and to movie mode and shoot the picture . you can not do any of the setup functions while it is in the case . regarding a stobe , sony makes one that looks a little cheezy . there is a `` universal '' strobe by sea life ( sl 960d ) that fits , but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera . i 'm waiting to how this works . one replacement o-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive . color-correcting ( red ) lenses are about $ 100 from sony , but not needed if you use a strobe . ( unless maybe to shoot movies ? )
0	i made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera . the color and noise was terrible . if you want a great point and shoot camera get the canon powershot s50 while they are still available . the camera has pro features , it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag . if you want to see s50 pictures go to [ ... ] and search my gallery cathreen styles . all most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50 . i am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks . by the way , i did end up buy a pro camera , mainly because of the look . i got the canon 30d and love it
0	canon 's 28-135mm with is ( image stabilizer ) is a far better choice for the money
1	i 'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera , the aiptek zoom dv-6 mp image stabilizing camcorder w/3x optical zoom . i see the claim that it has 3x optical zoom and can not help but question this because i am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since july 30th , 2006 . am wondering what gives with that ? please someone , post a review of this model and hopefully , some picture results too . let us know about this 3x optical zoom , please ! i had to pick a rating , so the four star rating was based on the mpvr version of this camera -- which i own and find to be a very decent gadget . mine is over a year old and still going strong - no problems with that model . mp3 's sound terrific . i convert movies for viewing on the camera while on the go and ... `` wow '' for its quality . i have recorded sounds and more . very decent ! just drag and drop my files from my pc to the sd card and i can switch out movies and mp3 's . i am happy with that model , but it does not have any optical zoom - just digital . still get pretty good pix tho , just use the various settings ... my little homemade movies are good , very decent , but without additional lighting , indoor movies will be dark . this camera doesnt handle well in strong sun - i use an umbrella over my cam as i film . big diff . so , is this newer model really all that much better ? ca n't wait to know ! 3x optical sounds good..
0	i ordered this digital frame for my husband for christmas , with the assurance from a `` tech weenie '' that it would work , based on the advertisement found at amazon . still uncertain whether the ad ( also found in philips cursory literature ) is really true . my husband is working with the `` phone people '' at philips to determine whether it will or will not interface with mac . if it does eventually work , the process has not been easy
1	there 's no question that paying $ 100 or more will get you a better monopod . but for $ 16 the sima smp-1 is a tremendous value . i have a sony dsc-w5 digital camera and have done everything i can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos . this monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry . the key is that it is small enough and light enough that i can take it almost wherever i go . and because it 's so small , i can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod . a monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod . but this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that i take on trips
0	boy , this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens . it 's a great a lens , but this is hardly worth the price
1	i 'm pleased with the purchase . i bought this camera just under two years ago when i was getting ready for a trip abroad . i spent six months in england , with five weeks travelling around europe with this camera in its case on my belt . it 's very sturdy if nothing else , between the trains , planes , hostels , and general bustle i 'm very pleased with how well it held up . nothing on it broke . i probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip , if not more . sure i 've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years i 've had it , but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well . the zoom on this camera is very nice . it 's one of the better zooms i 've seen on a simple camera of this type , or at least it was back when i bought it . it also has several features that older film cameras do not , such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture , or settings to take `` portraits '' or `` night shots . '' i know that this camera can not compare to professional cameras , i know that it does n't have all the frills of the new digital cameras , and i am not trying to compare it to those . i 'm not a professional photographer , so i do n't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot . i do n't want a digital for personal and professional reasons . for a traditional film camera , this one is the best i 've ever used . bottom line : good quality photos , a sturdy build , excellent zoom lens , useful and easy to use features , and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks
1	i purchased this case for my canon a530 camera . i find that it does a great job of being light , durable , and compact . it keeps the camera clean and scratch free . however i wish the case had a better carrying capacity . i would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips . i use different ones for different pictures or video . batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy . the case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn . that can be a bit akward . otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well .
1	the seller was super fast , the product well packaged and as described . thank you
0	it seems as if every time i want to use the camera , the battery is dead . i find that if i charge it and try to use it the next day , i should expect very much . i 'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes , but i should n't have to do so
0	there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . `` if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . '' read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !
1	i got this bag for under $ 15 and it is worth every penny . it fits my canon zr850 and accessories . it looks nice and it seems to be a great quality .
0	this s80 used to be the only wide angle compact point and shoot digital camera on the market . it has now been discontinued i 'm told . but , we 're in luck ! there are three other digital point and shoot cameras with a real 28mm wide angle lens ! these are : 1 ) the panasonic dmc-fx01 for $ 250 , and the 2 ) canon powershot sd800 is for $ 400 . and , 3 ) the kodak easyshare v570 for about $ 350 . so , you ask , `` who needs a 28mm lens ? '' you do ! most people concern themselves with how long is their telephoto lens . but , most people who `` know '' know that it is the wide angle lens that is most important -- -most of the `` best shots '' are made with a wide angle lens . for example , you 're in europe and you are trying to `` get a shot '' of that cathedral of notre dame over there . you need a wide angle lens . you are in the california poppy fields and you want to get the expanse of the golden-yellow poppy flowers with the huge blue sky filled with white clouds above -- -you need a wide angle lens . you are sitting at thanksgiving dinner and you want to take a photo from the foot of the table with everyone sitting on the left and right -- -you need a wide angle lens . you are in the garden of the california mission and you want to take a photo of the entire garden surrounded by the mission walls -- -you need a wide angle lens . it 's christmas day and you want a photo of the entire group of visitors in front of the christmas tree -- -you need a wide angle lens . this is where the 28mm lens on this camera comes in ! so , you need this camera ! otherwise you 'll be cutting off heads and leaving aunt sylvia out of the `` christmas group photo '' this year -- -and she 'll disinherit you and as a result of not having a wide angle lens you 'll live a life of poverty and misery everafter ! : o ) if you agree or disagree or know of any other digital point and shoot camera that has a wide angle lens please write , email : boland7214 @ aol . here 's one more wide angle candidate : kodak easyshare v705 7.1mp digital camera with 5x ultra-wide-angle dual-lens optical zoom
0	i was attracted to the cannon zr800 due to the very small size and very low cost . however , you get what you pay for , although you get much more in other brands for just a little increase in cost . i 've already returned my cannon zr800 and replaced it with the sony dcr-hc38 . the smallest problem with the canon is the continued motor noise , which you should be aware of it if you have read any review for any of the zr800 predecessors . the problem is that the motor is very loud , and you will hear a very annoying whirr if you are indoors . this could be forgivable given the low cost , but the problem with the zoom noise is not . when you zoom in and out , a very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go of the zoom switch . it is a loud click and when you play back your video this click is amplified on your video . it is impossible to watch a video and not notice this click . it is annoying , unusual and a big flaw with these new zr cannon camcorders . i called technical support , the person took a zr800 and tried it out and then acknowledged that a problem does exist ( she seemed stunned that this noise was occuring ) . bottom line , this camcorder is absolutely unusable due to this clicking noise and would not be worth using even if it were free . do not but it . btw , i love the sony dch-hc38 which is a bit more expensive and , like the zr800 , just recently came onto the market .
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel ( grey body ) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level . one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation . i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall
0	this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it does n't seem to fit my mark ii body properly .
1	at 10mp , this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures i have ever taken with a digital camera . the clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera . the display , although pooh-poohed by others as too small , is quite large to me . the cameras small , lithe design is another selling point . nothing bulky about this camera . you can put it in your front pants-pocket if you needed to . do yourself a favor and get this camera . you wo n't regret it .
1	this digital camera is the best . i can not complain about any aspect of it . it has a huge amount of modes and settings and additional features to add to pictures as you are taking them . it 's small enough to fit into your pocket and not think about it ( it 's smaller than a wallet ) . it takes excellent pictures that come out looking great , all very high quality . the huge screen makes it easy to view what you are looking at and has great image quality . the videos are equally good , with great sound and good picture . it looks better than just about any other digital camera that i have seen . even though i said i can not complain , there are a few things that slightly annoy me occasionally . the first is that it flashes twice . remember to tell this to people before taking their picture ! after the first flash , people tend to look away , and by the time the second flash comes and the picture is taken , the moment is lost . this only occurs when the camera is set to `` auto '' mode . i usually press the menu button and choose a mode . when you do this , the flashes occur very quickly ( you barely notice a gap between them ) . some of the features are very useful . i use the `` backlight '' mode quite often . it allows you to take a picture of something even if there is a bright light in the background . my only other complaint is for those of us with large fingers , the circular button that operates pretty much every feature can be difficult to use ( sometimes i push 2 buttons at once , or the complete wrong one ) . but everything else that this camera can do cancels it out . this camera has more features and better quality than many larger and more expensive cameras out there
1	good basic set of inexpensive filters . nice case . great for a beginner/starting set . if you 're willing to spend more money on filters , getting b+w or hoya will suit you better .
1	i have the white one ( black was unavailable at the time of purchase ) 1 . the camera will not slide out even though the clasp is magnet . it is made snug enough that the felt holds it in the case even with a shake or jostle . 2 . durable . no scrapes or scratches in 7 months . 3 . have n't missed the belt clip option , its small enough to fit in my pocket 4 . well constructed/durable . people think its some sort of ipod case/holder
1	very clear , bright day , strong magnification quality seems to be good . very well priced at around $ 100.00.i will know more over the passage of time .my firstimpression is good mj schra
1	not much to add to the other positive reviews posted , other than i am another user that loves my d50 . have had it for a year now and shot over 10,000 photos with excellent results ( mostly landscape and wildlife ) . excellent image quality and the hand grip fits perfectly to both my hand and my husbands . the only con i can think of at this time is that there is no backlight on the top panel - this makes it difficult to adjust settings in low/ no light situations . also , for people that are used to the little compact point shoot cameras this might seem a little overwhelming at first and bulky to carry around ( which is why i have a little pocket camera for my purse ) . i also got the 18-200 lens and love it - perfect walk around lens
1	the camera handles very well - it 's light and drives my zoom lens and 18-55mm lens beautifully . i get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight , which it does not have . the view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful , showing photos as they are taken - with zoom on the back screen , which immediately gives me the idea of the photo i want to use in my books . i say this is an outstanding lens and camera .
1	i can not find anything negative to say about this camera . i wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as casio 's exislim . even though this camera is not as small as the casio , it is far superior of a camera . size why 's , it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it is n't awkward or difficult to use . the pictures from this camera turn out spectacular , the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera . the lcd screen is also very clear , unlike the casio and other camera 's similar to this one . you ca n't go wrong with this camera . highly recommended
0	this filter is fine for normal shooting , but if you do low-light work , beware ; you will see bad internal reflections on night shots , and will need to remove the filter
1	this is original equipment battery charger manufactered by canon . the performance of the charger is excellent as are most canon products . the price paid was comparible to non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites . the item was recieved in original packaging , 3 days after placing the order , was new ( not reconditioned with a new appearance ) . i am extremely pleased with the entire purchase process experienced , from the information given at the site to ease of ordering and fast shipping
1	me encuentro muy conforme con el producto , es de excelente calidad y muy buen precio . amazon es para mi el mejor sitio para la compra de cualquier producto
0	i ordered this dv cable in hopes that i would be able to use it to transfer my videos from the dv camera to my computer , however , my computer does not have a dv plug-in . i have not been able to use the cable since i bought it and i am truly disappointed
0	the picture quality is okay , but the battery life is horrible
0	the documentation is terrible . its going to take a lot of practice . if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine . however i want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x sb600s . just setting the d200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the sb800/masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail , in the manual . the sb800 is designed for this purpose . so why not include information on how to do this ?
0	i only wish i could return this camera . its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants ( what i do most ) and its manual focus is difficult ( very difficult ) to use . my much cheaper , and lower resolution , old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions . i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus . in addition , photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card . do n't buy this camera
0	bought this as an xmas present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel . i 'm now on the 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w/phillips ) , and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external ( in my case , sony memory sticks ) . the internal memory is pitiful , and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it , you are not going to be able to hold very many internally . i 've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work , and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device , it 's certainly not always mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with , and the directions meager . i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag , the fact that the support stand ca n't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course , no mention of this in the product description . also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - no support for the new , ms produo sticks ( and no mention of that in the product descriptions either ) i thought i would get a quality product from phillips , and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately , it 's turned out to be a piece of junk , one i 've been screwing around with for so long that it 's probably not returnable . do n't waste your time and dollars ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..
0	i was very disappointed in nikon 's service . this camera has a 2in lcd display that apparently is very fragile . when i returned for service , nikon claimed i dropped it ... which i did n't ! i was very careful in handling this camera , but the fragile lcd still broke . to be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing . they offered to repair it for $ 210 , nearly the price of a new camera . i will never by a nikon product again . if they are going to sell such a fragile product , they should at least include a hard case for it .
0	i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it . the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out ( displaying blue and green pixels ) . i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all . overall do n't waste your time and money
1	i wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case . if there was i would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what i was looking for in this product . great quality nevertheless
1	i recently purchased this camera and i 'm loving it . as a whole it 's very easy to use and carry . i 'm a college student going into photograpy and this is a great starter camera . i have a feeling this one is going to be with me for a very long time
1	i bought my canon a540 recently from amazon and am completely satisfied . i added a 1gb sd card for $ 11 from ebay and a charger with 4 2500nimh aa batteries from the supermarket . the images are clear and large . you have the options of full automatic , various manual settings up to full manual and a wide selection of preprogrammed modes . at work we needed a new camera to record tiny scratches and imperfections in our manufactured product , so i took my camera in to demo . using the standard lens ( a macro lens is available but i do n't have it yet ) we photographed a quarter using only ambient light . in less than a minute we had the image on the screen and were able to blow it up until the date filled the screen and still maintain good detail . as a result we are now buying one for work with a macro accessory lens . i totally recommend it as an excellent all rounder
1	i got this camera for my birthday present in january and i 'm extremely satisfied . i 'm very new to the entire `` photography world '' , however this camera makes it easy to get into . the camera is smaller than i expected , however it takes great pictures . i use it often for pictures while we are on trips . the picture quality is great , however screen quality is n't up-to-par with other brands . this is a great value and i really like it . my only complaint is that the easyshare software is bad . it 's slow , outdated , and does n't work well overall . i recommend getting a 1 gb sd card . i have 3 of them
0	do n't buy this camera ! ! ! prone to `` memory error '' e18 errors after warranty is up . cost min $ 150 plus shipping to fix . this camera was great until 23 months went by then i started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors . i switched memory cards and it happened again . then the `` memory error '' displayed after a month or so of losing pictures . now it does n't work at all . i called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem . minimum cost is $ 150 or i could upgrade to a refurb s500 for $ 199 w/6 month warranty . they have to be kidding , $ 250 get me a new one . for what appears to be common problem i was expecting more from canon . guess i wo n't be buying another canon . google this `` canon `` memory error '' e18 '' and see for yourself that canon cameras have problems .
0	i bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my rebel xt . amazingly , i find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit . i find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance ( 8-10 feet ) to be under-exposed unless i correct the exposure using the menu . would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430ex are better , but i can not recommend this one
0	i purchased this along with a sony dcrhc21 . this carry case was listed as an accesory so i expected it to be appropriately sized ( as other sony cases i 've purchased fit like a glove ) . this case is entirely too large to hold a minidv camcorder . the camcorder rattles around inside it . if you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one . otherwise i suggest you look at the product specifications , note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder 's size .
0	i used to have an canon elura 70 , which was an excellent camcorder but the firewire transfer did n't work so i decided to replace it with the elura 100 only to find that canon had discontinued the elura line . i really wanted an elura for the improved video quality over the low-end zr models . so as a compromise i purchased the zr 850 which has a 1mp ccd , not a good as the elura ( 1.3mp ) but better than the other zr 's ( .640mp ) . the video quality was n't bad but the motor noise was so loud i could n't believe it . i returned the first one but the replacement was just as bad . this is n't a minor hum in the background i 'm talking about , its a full-on whine ! i also found the zr camera to be difficult to handle with my small-ish hands and the video stabilisation was a bit disappointing . luckily i could return both cameras without incurring a restocking fee and found a reconditioned elura 100 that is much more satisfactory . its a mystery to me how canon can produce two markedly different cameras ( quality wise ) in the same price range and opt to phase out the better one
1	im a graphic design student in college , so i really needed a camera . i decided on this one and i am really glad i did . the pictures are nice and clean . the camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact . the only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick , but i just took them out when i wasnt using them . buy this camera
0	the roll of paper that i recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper . i am trying to get it replaced but adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old . i was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues .
0	i got this charger with my sd110 , and within a few months , it stopped working ; it was obviously a battery problem . the battery is n't the best quality either , but when i got a new one , the problem persisted . so obviously it 's the charger .
1	i absolutely love this camera . i got it about 3 months ago and i cnt imagine life w/o it . im 13 nd mega clumsy nd it still has not one single scratch on it . it eats up batteries but so wat ? i love it buy it
0	there is currently a known issue with many of the sony camcorders . this is being called the `` black screen of death '' . what happens is that the camera works great for 1-2 years then the ccd goes out like a light . the camera will not take video again . sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support . the fact is sony does not stand behind their product . if this happens to you , sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars . there is a lengthy thread on cnet on this issue . search for sony black screen . wishing you luck in the purchase of your ( not sony ) video camera , scot
1	this took my d-200 to the final level ... great investment ... went 2to 3 days while on vacation while shooting 4 gigs a day of stuff ... love this little guy ... plus it allows for aa usage in a pinch.. got ta love that..
0	ok , maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much . the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera . both my 30d and rebel xt . if i am lucky enough it will fall off , get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory
0	polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some `` pop '' out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , `` it is canon , it must be quality . '' since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance
0	i bought this lens and was pretty excited about it , but i 've been disappointed . previous to this i bought the 50mm 1.8 for $ 70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame . i need a wider angle lens and went for this one , but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results . edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible , even at higher f stops . i shoot with a 20d . the usm is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens i choose to buy in place of this one . the focal range of 28-105 was also very nice , but to me the picture quality was not so good
0	i have been working with this camera for about a year now , for product shots online , and while sometimes it takes great pics , many times the flash pops and whites out , or it goes off and you get a black picture . i take pictures of jewelry , and if i try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration , the color is not accurate . purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up . while you can fiddle with 4 different picture taking settings , in all different modes , you 'll never get the same picture twice , even saving the setting . the light has to be just so , to get a good shot . when it shoots clearly , it can take fabulous pictures , but often , pics are blurred as many others have said , when they actually come out . my old camera , the dsc p71 3.2 megapixel is much better , colors are accurate always , shooting is flawless and foolproof every time , and the greatest feature is re-sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading . this feature is completely missing from the dsc p200 , which was the biggest disappointment , as i figured it would be a given i did n't have to ask about when purchasing . why would sony eliminate this great function ? had i know that when the salesman at the large new york city photo store told me this was the camera i dreamed of , i would not have bought it . i prefer also to use the rechargable aa batteries instead of the lithium battery , which is super hard to load , and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with . it is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle . every time it takes me several minutes , and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem . i recently took this camera on vacation to take pics and get footage for burning to dvd . sound quality is good , but video quality can be choppy , and the monitor did not let me even see that my setting was overexposed , so all my footage is somewhat overexposed for the entire trips shootings i made . the monitor , while big , does not show you always what you are shooting , whether a still , or movie picture . overall , i would not recommend this camera and i actually bought a used second of my old camera , and got my original repaired , because this one does n't compare . this camera is a bit too complicated and not very user friendly . even after using all this time , i still am not sure what i am going to get when i use this camera . i 'd say the worst features to be aware of are for someone who needs accurate color , this camera clearly has trouble showing blue/green shades , and purples accurately , you can never show these colors are they are in life with this camera , and the lack of the `` trimming '' resizing feature , what was sony thinking ? next time , i am trying something other than sony cybershot unless i hear they have gone back to making a great straightforward , uncomplicated easy to point and shoot camera . this one is definitely not
1	i purchased the videocamera thinking i could watch my old tapes also . this videocam does not do that . i had to return it
0	i own several great digital cameras . it seems like i get one for each use - one with good zoom , another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others . this one i wanted for the high mp in a small compact size that i can put into my pocket . the first few photos were great , taken outdoors in my sunny patio . then every picture i took after that ( same settings - fine , hq , poster 10m etc ... and vertical lines started showing on the lcd screen and the pictures were all washed out . when i download them on the computer , they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white . i 've played around with the settings ( and i do know how to work them ) but still it does the same . so time to return to find a better one . that 's too bad since i read some good reviews and wanted to have it
1	very clear pictures , very happy with this camera . note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder , but this has n't been a problem for me as it 's pretty easy to use
0	bought this as an xmas present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel . i 'm now on the 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w/phillips ) , and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external ( in my case , sony memory sticks ) . the internal memory is pitiful , and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it , you are not going to be able to hold very many internally . i 've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work , and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device , it 's certainly not always mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with , and the directions meager . i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag , the fact that the support stand ca n't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course , no mention of this in the product description . also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - no support for the new , ms produo sticks ( and no mention of that in the product descriptions either ) i thought i would get a quality product from phillips , and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately , it 's turned out to be a piece of junk , one i 've been screwing around with for so long that it 's probably not returnable . do n't waste your time and dollars ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..
0	my coolpix 8800 lapsed into `` system error 2 '' mode within weeks of getting it . after taking 3 or 4 shots the error message comes up and i have to shut it down and start it back up to take a few more shots before the error 2 message recurrs . nikon says to try a fresh battery and different storage card ... no help . now nikon says says send it in and we 'll fix it- but do n't say what it will cost ... the shots i do get are n't as good as an hp camera we have that was half the price . the controls are ridiculously complex . the flash pops up and fires when shooting in bright light ... the whole thing is a piece of junk . the only good shots i 've gotten with it are inside shooting documents from 2 feet away ... but for any outdoor complicated lighting it is unreliable ... i would n't recommend this camera or any nikon product to my worst enemy ... .oh yeah , and they made the lens an oddball size so you have to buy overpriced nikon filters for it ... .
0	-- update 4/23/2007 - the vendor indicates a new firmware release is due in the 5/2007 - 6/2007 time frame , and it may fix the issue of the limited number of pictures mentioned below . -- picture quality is fair and adjusting brightness and contrast in the setup yields good results . appearance of the unit is good and the black and cherry frames are nicely finished , but the red rectangular sensor for the remote below the lcd display mars the effect somewhat . at 5.6 inches , this size frame is only useful where it can be viewed up close . the images are smaller than a 4x6 print that you would typically view in a book or hold in your hand . i found putting it on a book shelf to be too far away . on an end table next to the chair you would view it from is better . the size of the lcd also should tell you that resolution is not spectacular , true of any frame in this category . my biggest problem with this particular unit is that even after updating to the latest firmware ( ~3/2007 ) , it will only display up to about 250 pictures . i expected that what ever was on the memory card i inserted would be displayed . overall this is still a good buy if you do not want to display a large number of photos . i am very disappointed that the number of displayable pictures is not listed in the manufacturer 's product description so you know of the limit before you purchase it
0	wow ... now if you really want to see a rip-off , here it is . not to be damaging to amazon.com but hey for the 50mm just get some carboard and tape it to the front to shield it from the sun . the hood is definitely not worth it
1	celestron 's tool is easy to carry , easy to use , and ( at least in my case ! ) gives me quick , precision collimation with my newtonian . why pay for a laser collimator ( which needs to be calibrated ) when you can use this ? collimation is the most important part of your setup ; without good mirror alignment , all you 'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights . this combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless , and also fairly fast . highly recommended for any level of observer
0	the power cord that accompanies this charger is bulkier than the charger itself . you would n't get that from the picture . too bad , other manufacturers have learned to incorpaorate the plugging mechanism directly into the charger .
1	this camera is an exelent camara . it has plenty of effects , plenty of modes , plenty of scenery options . the image quality is 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . the pictures you take without the flash do end up getting a bit blury , where as if you take it with the flash , it comes out exelent . and sometimes it takes a long time for the picture to get taken with out the flash , and sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws are only with my version . but if you are looking for a good camera with a great price , this is your best option
0	i purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last march . i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support . they went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up . well i followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been . so they said i should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it . then i sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there . they sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing . well i just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem . they never fixed the problem . mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son 's life before the age of 2 . i called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor . she said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera . well i was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late august a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera , but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped . she said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera . i told i have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before i sent it in the first time . i started to cry that my son 's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when i got off the phone . the camera is worse than a disposable camera . do n't waste your time or money on this piece of junk . i recommend olympus . my olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk . i am planning on contacting the better business bureau regarding this matter . please do n't waste your time on this , like i have to ! i hope this helps people make better choices ! good luck ! i wish someone could have forecasted this for me
1	this is just a plain sweetheart of a lens . it covers the useful 18-35 mm range ( which is 27-52mm on a nikon digital slr , which is a very useful range ) . this lens costs less than half the price of the ( expensive ) professional nikon 17-35 , and does almost as nice a job . sufficiently nice , in fact , that most amateurs will not discern much , if any , difference . while not built like a tank , i think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent , and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros . on a nikon digital slr , which will use the center portion of this lens ( due to the size of the sensor in the slr ) you can expect excellent , even spectacular results . this is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots , portraits , or just plain walking around taking pictures . someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent , versatile lens . this one is great for parties , vacations , and the works . the images i have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast , are very sharp , and have beautiful color rendition . there just is not a lot not to like about this lens . i give it 4 stars for overall performance , but 5 stars for value and price/performance . some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers . this is one of those
1	i recently recieved my new camera , and i am thrilled . i have been researching which camera to buy since december ( when our last camera went capoot ) . there have been mixed reviews for the olympus sw series , but could not resist the appeal of this camera 's unique features . i can not wait to take it into the pool this summer with the kids . so far , the point and shoot options and pictures have been lovely . any person can screw up pictures with any camera , but this camera has so many features to avoid that . my husband and i had a wonderful time taking extreme close up shots of our garden . i have not seen that quality , and had that much satisfaction from a camera since we first switched over to digital . i am very pleased , to say the least , with this purchase .
0	i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years . i love everything canon does . however i do not understand canon 's reasoning behind producing this lens . the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the `` film '' plane . they can not do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens . they have indicated , however , that by 35 mm that advantage is gone . why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses ? i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper ; but this lens is only $ 60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro . as i said , if for $ 60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach ( 66 in 1.6crop cameras ; useful in macro photography ) and that works on all canon cameras , i 'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all . granted , you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon , but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr 's , so why bother with this lens ? the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup , but the 60mm macro does n't make any sense to me . my $ 0.0
1	i see a lot of people have had trouble tracking baseballs with this thing . i 've owned one for 3 years and it works pretty well . i will give some tips on it : ! ! ! if you throw at a respectable speed , and do n't follow the correct procedure it will not work - there will be no reading ! ! 1 ) do n't stand behind a metal fence . the chain links with the plastic coating over them will work , but for whatever reason exposed metal interferes with the signal . 2 ) the focus beam of the radar gun is very narrow . the whole idea is to keep the beam on the ball as long as possible . just having the ball pass through the radar beam is not enough . you need to keep the beam on the ball for practically the whole pitch . 3 ) use rechargable batteries ... and this is n't to save money . some of the better energizer rechargable are high amperage , 1350 ma and up . the gun tends to respond better to this , as its pretty power hungry . you will get more consistant readings with better batteries . non-rechargable batteries can not provide the same level of current ( usually 850 ma or less ) , which seem to effect the gun . so , how would you properly use the gun ? one way is to stand behind the mound as the pitcher throws . forget about using it during a game , behind the backstop . it wont work . try line up the pitchers release point and the plate , then situate your gun so that it fires on this imaginary line ( connecting pitchers hand and the target . you may have to slightly change the angle of the gun to track the pitch , which can be slightly tricky . follow the ball with the gun as long as you can . for a sure fire way to clock a throw , get a cheap net and stand behind it . you will register it every time . you will also have the most accurate reading
1	very happy with our camera ! perfect condition and quick arrival
0	this is an alright camera . if you 're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace , or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments , this camera should serve you fine . what i liked about it : 1. it 's compact , lightweight and easy enough to use 2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice 3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i 've used what i disliked about it : 1. it 's a bit flimsy to be honest 2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon , evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark . even though it has a night landscape option , it does n't really work . 3. the flash causes a horrible delay ( but that 's been mentioned like 9,000 times before ) this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots . i 'd also strongly discourage buying it if you 're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events
0	very cheap , you can tell it 's an fake camera miles away . sure it has these features of motion detector which makes it move and has led lights ; but not worth 6 dollars at all . stay awa
0	you got to have extremely steady hand , or camera stand to use this camaera . during my niece wedding , i put in a 2gb of memory and we were trigger happy , we must have took over couple hundred of pictures , however , i am very unhappy about the result . 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy , messy , out of focus . on the other hand , for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand , you got a great picture . size is good , weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size , but to some people that 's good quality
0	i bought this item for $ 40 online and then found out my canon camera didnt need a cannon brand charger and i could have bought one for $ 10 instead . in total i spent for this charger which included the shipping and handling . not worth it . go to another store and by one for $ 10
0	this was a waste of money . my 5 year old loves taking photos . she uses my digital camera sometimes . i thought this would be a great gift for her . she could see the photos on the back of the camera like mom 's . this was not the case . the lcd does not project the images and it is so small you can not read what mode you are in . if the batteries run out , it erases the photos . i think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly . my daughter was frustrated quickly and it has laid in the drawer for 3 months . if your child likes to take photos , i would invest in something else
1	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas , and he is absolutely in love with them . the distance it can handle is slightly above average , but the clarity is really where this thing shines . its very easy to use , and has held up reasonably well . i would recomend it to the casual user
1	we love this camera . it 's small , easy to use , has a big lcd screen and takes great pictures . fuji has always been a great product and this one is no exception
0	this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [ ... ] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?
1	sony has done it again ! fast charging and long lasting , this battery is perfect for my sony cyber-shot camera !
0	bought the samsung 363 from amazon and it developed mechanical fault while i was test running . making strange noise after loading the tape making it unuseable . about 2 weeks later , i decided to show it to a friend in case it was something unserious and then i realised again that it was not even coming up again . problem with the power system . paralysing it completely ( all in less than 3 wks from purchase . left it plugged to charge for 2 days without difference it 's indeed a sad story . that would be my last time of buying a tape camcorder .
0	i am a nikon fan i have nikon 6t and nikon d50 . but about coolpix 4600 : all picutures are always blurred or atleast fuzzy . it somehow take decent photos of face and buildings ( if they have strong straight edges/stripes )
1	excellent product , easy to use , great for edging cards and making trims for cards and craftwork . i ca n't wait to experiment with it
1	not only is this beauty wide , i have found the lens is very sharp to on my d200 ! it is built solid and focus 's fast , and i do n't have any problem with distortion because i use dxo optics software and it cleans it up automaticly ! buy this lens , it is cheap for what you get
1	i purchased this bag to carry my hp photosmart digital camera and photo printer along with , 100pk 4 '' x 6 '' photo paper , power cord and two chargers that each hold 4 aa batteries , and i still have room left . i 'm very pleased
0	i have been using this cord for about a year , and i had problems with its durability . it actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months , but then it started to fall apart . when mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket , the thin plastic shoe ( where the flash is attached to ) developed a crack and eventually broke off , making it useless to mount the flash . i had to buy a replacement part from canon ( who charged me $ 16 for this small plastic piece ) . i flipped the flash carefully from then on , but then it still cracked ! ! i wrote to canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic . so far , there is no response . a few months later , the cord , for some unknown reason , makes my 550ex flash switch from the ettl to ttl mode , and making the flash fire at full power , overexposing the entire image . i checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera 's hotshoe , and the flash worked fine , switching back to the ettl mode . for a piece of equipment from canon , it 's hard to imagine it giving so many problems . it 's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories . as there are no other oem manufacturers of this cord , i am forced to get another one and hope for the best .
0	1 year old ... 3 e18 errors 2 battery erros shipped back for service 4 times ! search the net for e18 before you buy !
1	this case was well thought out for snorkeling/diving and using your own digital camera without going to the expense of a really expensive camera . definitely a better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one . the only drawback is that it triples the size of the great 720sw camera - since size is one of its strongpoint
0	ordered two frames from the third party source . neither on of them worked at all . it has been a nightmare trying to return them for a refund
0	i agree with the many other users who have experienced the `` condensation , operation paused '' defect on their jvc gr-xxxx . despite numerous others reporting this problem , jvc says its not a recognized problem . i would disagree - it is a recognized problem , but its your problem , not theirs .
0	very easy to set up , but no matter what i did , i got several horizontal interference bars . one very nice feature is a built in video modulator that allows you to connect to older tvs using a coax cable instead of rca . i am returning this product
1	received camera exactly as described . easy and smooth transaction would by from this vendor again . thank
1	not knowing fully what i was getting into , on a whim i purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product , i mean-it was so cheap . i was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what i had was a very high quality monopod . this was my second monopod and so i had another to compare it with ( the other was bought on an auction website ) . in comparison the opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and i use it exclusively on my minidv shoots
0	i bought this because it was 50 % off . i ca n't see how anybody can get much enjoyment from trying to look at photos on this viewer . i guess for background noise , it would be good but as a photo viewer , it 's not . small screen + low resolution = poor viewer
1	this camera is amazing . out of the 3 digital camera 's under $ 150 i 've used , this is by far the best , beating out the kodak and the sipix . i originally bought the sipix , and it was junk . do n't buy the sipix that 's under $ 150 . the kodak for some reason did n't seem like it took as good pictures as the finepix , but the software was a little better , being from kodak . this camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels , but i do n't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing . it comes with a 16mb removable memory card , so you can take around 49 pics at 1mp , around 24 at 2mp , and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution , or more on a lower setting . the lcd screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power , and the 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long . it has a nice , sleak design , and the software has no issues with windows xp at least . the only cons i could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2x digital zoom , which is pretty much useless , and i never use it , since it 's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer . so you can consider it not having any zoom . the software for it works well , but it could be better , options wise . the filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card , so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day ( since it creates folders based on date ) , you 'll have to rename each pic . but i hardly complain , since the pictures come out so incredibly well . i 'm so happy with this camera ! if you want a camera under $ 150 , this is the one to get . do n't even waste your time with the kodak , unless you want the one with 3x optical zoom , but that 's $ 200 . i use it for general purpose , taking pictures of freinds and such . once in a while i take a picture of a sunset at 2mp , and that will be photo quality printed on a full page . 1mp creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images , and .3mp will created good smaller images to put on websites . there 's no reason to buy anything else , go with the fuji finepix a200 !
0	i loved this camera when i got it . but after three months the lens would not close . it makes grinding noises , the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again . i am very disappointed in this camera
0	i purchased this camera for a friend to use in hawaii . we had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and i was frustrated . i do not know if this is just a bad camera or what
0	camera worked great for us for 6 months . easy to use , decent pictures and good software . the battery life was fine for our use . it quit working at six months and would no longer focus and is now useless . for a six month disposable camera its a little expensive .
0	this thing stinks ! so much digital noise its output is terrible . i do n't know how they can put this thing out and have it be so bad . do n't be fooled thinking wow 8 megs for a low price , i have a 5 meg sony that is many times better . all that noise blows the detail out . get it if you like lots of little green and red flecks in your pictures , other wise stay away
0	i 'm going to be completely honest with you . i hated the hp camera 's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur 's out if you do not stand still taking the picture . i 've had an old hp camera and i have had this newer hp camera and they are all the same . it doesnt seem like it really matters what mp they are . still bur 's out and it is disappointing . i guess it really depends on the person about this camera but i 'd rather have a sony , samsung , or some other company 's item . =
0	my cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so i ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one . although this camera is 6 mp , my 3.0 cannon took much clearer pictures . i have had this camera for 9 months and i am sending it in for the second time for repair . first the power button stopped working , and then on easter ( something about holidays ) all of the functions of the buttons switched . when i pushed delete , the menu came up . even the mode selector was n't working . it was reviewing the pictures in all three modes . i will say that sony support online is very helpful , but i need something more reliable . i am done with this camera
1	this camera is easy to use and makes a good quality recording . since it is an upper end product , it does have a longer learning curve than more simple models but the effort is worth it for the added features . there are , however , a few quirks which could have been fixed to make this a much more usable piece of equipment . the provided microphone jack is an 1/8 '' stereo . in my camera , at least , it is not mounted very securely . when i have an external mike connected , i had to be very careful to make sure that nothing touched it , otherwise , the sound would drop off . a friend with some tools and expertise fixed this problem but it should never have happened . the master switch moves from off to vcr mode ( up one ) , record to tape mode ( down one ) or record to stick mode ( down two ) . it is intuitive but very easy to overshoot the mark . this can be frustrating and i can not help but believe there is a better design that could be used . the `` vcr '' controls are located on the top surface of the camera . they are intuitive and employ commonly used symbols . they are also backlit and impossible to discern in sunshine . you can see the symbols but there is no way to tell which , if any , of the functions are selected . it is still usable but it is a pain in the backside . there are a multitude of things that could be done to make the interface on this camera easier to use but it is usable as it is now .
0	i bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed . i sent it into nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty . the repair charge with shipping and tax would be $ 115.22 . i am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused . battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time i had it . for this reason i would never buy another nikon product again . next digital camera will charge without removing battery . camera takes great pictures , but ca n't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty . bye bye nikon
1	my first digicam , bought it 2 years ago . simple to use , great pictures , and a year ago ( and hundreds of pictures ago ) i dropped it ( no in its case ) on a cobblestone road - no damage . have never seen the need to replace it . i like the common batteries it uses and the sd memory
1	this is not a high-tech digital frame . it does n't play mp3 's . it does n't come with a remote . it simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode . there 's an `` on '' button and an `` off '' button . there is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame ( though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet ) . it 's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off . if you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location , or choreograph your pictures with music , then this is not the frame for you
0	ok , i imagine if you forked over the $ 900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal , but i am going to say it anyway . this little baby is way over priced , not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work . you need a wireless router ! ! so rather than just complain , let me tell you what i want canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution ! with cf cards in the 12gb range it does n't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons ( i know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16mp that shoot in jpeg raw on the highest settings just laughed at me ) , however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot , take out the card , etc . what i want is a bluetooth compact flash card . they make these so i know it is possible . i would like canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that i can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera . now that would make it so that when i am in the studio or shooting a wedding , i have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and i do n't have to drag along a wireless router and i saved myself $ 700 . get to it canon - i am waiting ! ! !
1	this is a must have item for your kodak dig . camera . it allows for filters , tele/wide aux lenses or any 55mm screw on attachment . apart from that the black metal enclosure compleatly covers the entire lens assemby , at any zoom or focal length . this adds a very strong and valuable protection to your lens . if you accidentally bang the camera against a hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens ( camera ) from destruction . i always keep it on with a skylight filter , the skylight or a uv filter further protects the lens from impact , scratches and dust . if used when the lens is not fully extended ex : wide angle to normal zoom , the adpter also helps block out stray light and acts as a light shade . kodak aught to have this built into their camera as a permanent fixture , but alas they make extra revenue on their accessories . do buy it !
0	i have had this camera for about a year and a half . i got so fed up with it that i just bought a new one . i admit , this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom is n't used . however , this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used . i would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera
1	very easy to use , multiple languages , something nice and easy for even unexperienced users . recommend to anybody buy it , it 's worth it . and the price is right for the features and mp . i would not hesitate to pay more for this camera . kodak has done wonderful job with this on
0	hp is selling this bag for $ 30 bucks , so when i found it here for $ 10 less i could n't let this `` deal '' pass me by ... however when i received the bag , i wished i had ... the color is less vibrant , it 's cheap , poor quality , plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag ... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead , it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !
0	this is a nice case , however , i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends . this case is bulky and my panasonic fxo1 would fit into something much smaller . i ended up going with a great case that i found at wal-mart for a cheeper price , sleeker design , small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town
0	very disappointed by canon on the fit of this adapter . adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view and create flash shadows
0	this was my second camcorder- after a canon that lasted 2 years but developed motor noise . this panasonic literally suddenly died after only 3 months ( well , 3 months and a week- thereby a week too late for the warranty and a `` too bad , so sad '' response from panasonic ! ) . i had used it to film a wedding- it had terrible indoor quality and poor sound quality and obviously had a short pathetic lifespan . do not buy this camera
1	i got a pair of these for christmas . initially , i was skeptical about the quality of an inexpensive roof-prism optic , and this is n't my favorite brand name either . but contrary to my expectations , i 've been extremely impressed with them so far . good brightness , contrast , sharpness , field of view , and close focus all exceeded my expectations for a binocular at this price point . feel , fit and finish are all very good . i wear eyeglasses , and these binoculars still deliver a nice wide view through the eyepiece . the twist-down eyecups are quick to extend / retract if you are sharing these with someone who does n't wear glasses . they come with a decent carry case , and relative to porro-prism types , the weight and compactness are both a little bit better . if you are looking for a good binocular for birding or general use , i highly recommend you take a look through these in addition to the other popular models . i think these really hit the sweet spot for price / size / weight / performance , and i 'm very happy with them
0	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 . my intent was to put him in the shade . that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 . tried new batteries , tried bluffing , even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards . my opinion is this product is not worth the postage . anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product . [ ...
1	what 's not to like ? light , compact and comes with the strap , case and wipe cloth . they are perfect . keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still
0	the case is very big . why buy a small camera and end up with a big case . the case looks nothing like the picture . the picture is of another case .
1	for less $ 100 you can hide all your electronic equipment and still control it with the original remotes . this product does everything it promises , i recommend it with no reservations . 110 % satisfied ! ! ! !
1	great tripod . we 're using it in a television studio w/sony vx-2000 cameras . they work great
0	i was expecting much more from this flash , i already started looking for the better one . if i knew this was a closeout item i 'd never buy it . it died on me with no indication , sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it . now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries ... save money and buy 5xx series flash..
0	to add on to the previous reviewers , i was very disappointed with this camera 's performance . i compared the `` 5 megapixel '' photos with photos taken with my canon , powershot g3 ( 4megapixels ) , and the scd6550 simply did not produce the same quality stills . the camera itself also seemed flimsy . the idea of having a two-in-one camera is so attractive . but another attractive concept , canon 's elura50 , offered a camcorder with a compact design . in the end , however , it broke down only after a year and a half . for a $ 500 purchase that is not a durable lifespan ( cf . reviews for elura50 and you will see that many are having hardware problems ) . this camera seemed less durable than the elura50 as i maneuvered the various parts and dials . of course , i am returning the camera before it can prove its durability . nevertheless , maybe the folks at cnet can stake their money on it . lastly , i should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed . i found that i had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button . this definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments . again , this camera is a great idea . but , i suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording . this one is on the right track , but , still so far from accomplishing a quality product .
0	here 's one more a95 to add to the ever increasing list of e18 failures . thanks to the horror stories from the other posters i 'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired . the camera is only about 2 years old ... guess i 'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits ! the camera really performed nicely when it was working ... thus the 2 stars . hope you have better luck than me if you get one
1	i do n't like pink so i bought the blue bag . i had bought a black one , but it was so skimpy i returned it and prayed until this one arrived . i had no trouble with amazon crediting me for the return , either . it was so cute ! i 'm too old for `` cute , '' but i kept it because i needed a case for my new hp r717 . it is small , yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it . i have dropped my camera and it was not injured . it has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera , not the big aa batteries , but the flat type that come with my r717 . i recommend this little bag , or the pink one , even if you do n't like pink ... or blue . they are well cushioned and snug , but not too snug you think they will tear . the are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures
1	i , like many people , research high-tech purchases before buying because of the complexity of the items and the invariably high cost of some of the items . digital cameras are no exception . i was looking for a replacement for my konicaminolta dimage z1 . my requirements were fairly straight forward : the new camera had to have a 10x zoom , no less than a 5mp processing chip , and third , get my photography skills to the point that the camera after this new one could be a dslr . i have read the reviews here on amazon regarding the performance of the s9000 , and while some of them , i felt , were right on , others did not read the professional reviews before purchasing this camera . the intended use of this camera has never been a point and shooter . while the s9000 does possess automatic functions to `` streamline '' use , these features are whoafully inadequate for the overall optical and proccessing capibilities that fuji strove for in it 's design . let me for clarifications ' sake say this loud and clear : if you want breathtakingly beautiful , clear , vibrant pictures with perfect exposure using this camera , then you must use the manual settings . this is not a point and shoot type of a camera ! ! ! ! ! ! out of the box the s9000 has been a godsend . not only are the images super sharp with no hint of edge fall off that hampers other high res cameras , but the exposure is so perfect that i question my ability for luck . the setups are very easy and the controls and functions are a snap . the white balance and shutter speed settings are not easy concepts to grapple with in potography , and yet fuji has made short work of them with their intuitive design . there really are two photographic miracles at work in the s9000 : one , is the processor that captures detail and color that you feel guilty for paying so little for something that is better than much more expensive equipment , and two , is that the exposure is so good that if i did not know better , i would think that i was using an advanced film slr . this is an absolute rave for this product . the fit and finish are superb , ergos are comfortable and controls easy to find and use , and it fulfilled my need for a camera that would get me ready for a dslr but not be too complex . the only downside to this camera is that it will take time to process the image before exposure , but outside of some dslrs , this is a problem with all digital cameras . it is true that this camera is big and heavy , but then photographic perfection ai n't free . home run fuji ! !
1	i 've owned the t9 now for just about 3 weeks . i purchased it after some extensive research . of course you never really know a product until you 've had it awhile . here 's my thumb nail opinion . i like : the ultra thin metal body optical image stabilizer great photo quality high iso performance large , high rez screen auto focus assist lamp works well very fast start-up fast recovery even after flash lots of built in memory , but you need to buy the 1 or 2 gig card ok slide show feature with music i do n't like : redeye does n't work that well too few manual controls needs white balance needs long shutter speed modes chews up battery time pretty fast . already ordered a second battery . no optical viewfinder ( most ultra smalls do n't ) flimsy plastic cover over the battery will be first thing to break all in all a great little camera . takes awesome , clear pics . not for the professional photographer , but that 's not why you are considering it ( i hope ) .
0	it got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it ( a month or so later ) it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly . a huge disappointment and waste of my money
0	after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g . use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) .
0	bought this camera to have better print pictures than what i get with the digital . i 've tried using it in every mode auto , close-up , etc . but the autofocus never works so most of the pictures come out blurry ! my older simpler camera took better pictures
1	this lens has only two `` faults . '' first , it is big and heavy -- quality construction often yields a heavy lens . second , once the photographer has seen the results that this lens can produce , there is a likelihood that he or she will be unhappy with the other lenses in the camera bag . results first : the images are razor sharp with this zoom mounted on my nikon d70s . i can get shots that i never could get before because this lens is so crisp that subjects taken at a distance nevertheless can be cropped to produce an acceptable close-up image . subjects taken at more normal distances are breathtakingly sharp -- as if shot with an excellent prime lens . this is a fast lens ( f/2.8 throughout its entire zoom range ) . almost more importantly , this lens has the best `` bokeh '' that i have ever experienced in a lens . `` bokeh , '' to the extent that i understand the concept ( it is a japanese word meaning roughly `` unfocused '' ) , is a word describing whether the out-of-focus portion of an image ( i.e . a blurred background in a photo in which only the subject is in focus ) has a pleasing look to it . this lens produces wonderful , creamy bokeh . the sharpness and bokeh , combined with the excellent bright color rendition of this lens , makes this one a true classic . i have occasionally experienced minor ghosting on this lens when shooting into a very bright subject , i.e . the sun reflecting off of the ocean . this is a normal shortfall of a zoom lens comprised of a multitude of elements , and i have sometimes experienced this . but such occasions are rare . the autofocusing action of this lens is very good . even birds at very long distances usually produce a quick , snappy autofocus lock on my nikon d70s . very seldom does it `` hunt '' for an af lock , and these occasions are likely due to operator error rather than the lens . this lens also features vibration reduction ( vr ) which enables it to produce acceptable images below what an f/2.8 lens would otherwise be suitable for . the vr really works , too , although it is by no means a panacea for dim lighting . this is one of nikon 's professional lenses , and the quality of construction is excellent . the critical mount is metal , and the entire lens is built like a tank . the lens comes with a nice squeeze-style lens cap , and a very good lens hood that can be easily reversed for storage . the reader can see that i am extremely enamored with this lens . the reason is that , notwithstanding its bulk and weight , this lens produces the best nature shots that i have ever managed to take , by far .
1	set the diffusion to 'stun ' when you do n't want your flash to 'kill ' with harsh , sharp , shadowy edges . yes , you need this if you have an sb-600 . why ? nikon does n't make a diffuser for that model . basically , it fits snugly on the tip of the flash , slides off and on easy , will also protect your flashbulb from acidental nicks , like that macro shot of the benihana chefs . here 's what it does : diffuses your flash without having to go all into your menu settings and make adjustments . simple , sherlock . the omni-bounce ( what an imaginative name for a piece of shaped plastic ) performs as expected , no real cons , except shipping adds almost 50 % to the price , so check your local camera shop to see if they have it in stock before ordering
0	i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod . come to find out , this model does not have a fluid head , meaning , if you do any panning with a camcorder , it wo n't be as smooth as you 'd probably like it to be . also , at the end of a pan the head tends to `` unwind , '' causing your panned image to back up a little ways . thus , i think it 's rather misleading to label this as a `` photo / video '' tripod . additionally , i do n't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters . finally , mine came with a few , very minor cosmetic blemishes , almost as if it were used . instead of video , i 'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount . if you want to do video , please buy a tripod with a fluid head . you 'll love it , i guarantee that . that 's why i give this one 2 stars
0	the battery is good after a full charge . it lacks in holding the promised charge . i find after 2 weeks it is questionable , depending on how many pictures were taken before the camera sat waiting to be used again . i got over 100 pictures when used in 3 days , which is more that my aa nimh 2100mah . which i bought from walmart { so probably not a super battery } the wallmart batteries actually hold the charge longer { very sad } .the charge time is not to long when charger from half charge . over all , i hope the next ones i buy will be better than these . my solution is to carry a non rechargeable battery in my case for when the delkin dies . i also try to give it a full charge before leaving the house , as there is no memory effect . i also recomend checking to see if there is a firmware upgrade for your camera . every camera shuts off when the battery is at a different power level . my nikon coolpix 3100 , seems to shut down sooner than later . all reviews should mention what camera they are using for this reason . have been using 3 months now .
1	yes it is a very fine lens . is and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this i decided to sell it in favour of my ef 24-70 2.8l after 2 weeks of usage . f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier . bokeh is also worse than the other one . the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies . 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size . plus the macro option is weaker on this one . if you do n't care about the weight go with the ef 24-70 2.8l imho .
1	this product offers a realy equity between price and quality , and a good results in photos
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera . followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail . it appears that this remote is defective
1	this is a very flexible and capable camera . if you are looking for more than a point shoot will offer , there are very few that would compare . for me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle , if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing . the 16:9 is an ok feature if you plan on hdtv veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4:3. i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16:9 feature . the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside , i am very satisfied
0	i own the olympus fe-100 digital camera , and it came with unchargeable batteries ( oxyride ) . i switched to energizer batteries and bought an energizer 4-battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas . it 's not a quick charger like this one , but i say for less than half the investment , i 've got a charger that does the job . i would not spend this kind of money on a charger . so i say , if you 're part of the `` got ta have it now '' generation , you definitely pay for convenience . otherwise , charge your batteries more slowly ( 2-3 hours ) and save a lot of money
1	i shot my second feature ( flying tiger ) on the dvx and took it to the cannes film fest market and no one could tell it was n't film . this camera is fantastic if you shoot right . i suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models . we have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite . the jvc is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas , true , but for the money , the dvx , if you shoot properly with it , will get you amazing results . for proof , you can check out footage shot in a ton of lighting conditions at my site . we had the best luck in natural light , with simple chimera diffusers . if you 're honest with yourself and do n't plan on hitting the lottery anytime soon ( getting a real distribution deal/full 35mm blowup ) and you need a good looking film for fests or dvd , there is no way you should shoot on film , or another camera . we shot a full feature on no money and had many distrib offers , all because of the look this camera gave us . i 'm planning on using it again for my next film . ! viva la revolucion ! put the dvx in 24p advanced mode and rip the knob off
1	the battery is perfect and once in the camera , is indistinguishable from the original .
1	i bought this dock from a seller called miga . they did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition . i use the dock for my hp r817 . having read the reviews regarding the insert i just went through hp 's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera . it was only $ 5 ( before shipping ) and it arrived the same day as the dock package . the dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost $ 50 and up by itself from hp . i bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when i go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit . i probably wo n't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock . but for what i will use it for its an excellent product for the price and i highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there .
1	this is a nice lightweight tripod from sony . stable and well built . i have used it with both still and video cameras without any problems . it would be nice if it came with a travel bag of some sort
0	i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years . i was extremely happy with my olympus , but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i 'm expecting . this camera was such a disappointment . just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using the flash . i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash . ) plus , if you used the zoom at all , the pictures came out fuzzy . the first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! the store i bought the camera from would n't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy . so , i sold the camera and took a $ 100 loss . i 'd much rather lose $ [ ... ] than keep this camera
1	hoods offer several benefits to the photographer . primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image , or the appearance of lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality . a hood is not required to eliminate these problems , as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light . the hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one . this hood being a solid conical two inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element . there is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws . when in place , the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects . replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing or replacing a lens . this hood is manufactured for the canon 85 f/1.8 usm ef , 100 f/2.0 usm ef , 135 f/2.8 usm ef , 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 usm ef lenses and normally is not included with the lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens , and is worth considering . since the hood is wider than the lens ; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position . this does n't add to the length of the lens , but does make it wider by about an inch . an inch may not seem like a lot , but in a tightly packed camera bag , it is huge . fortunately canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag . while the protective benefits exist , they are secondary and limited . i find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood . considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment ( except for a lens case ) , purchasing a hood is money well spent . pros : improves contrast and image quality offers limited protection to the lens cons : takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len
0	i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named `` digital voice editor '' . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .
0	received the dxg-506v yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount . many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam . this is kind of like false advertising . this is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices ( like the optimus that radio shack sells ) and there is also no image stabilization . geez , how hard would it have been to put a simple ¼ inch plastic mount on the bottom . as for sound , the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting . you can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting . that is pretty bad . the resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970 's cassette tape recorder . the best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in avi , mov or asx format at different resolutions which is why i got it in the first place . it is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical . it also has a lens cap . my advice to dxg is this . 1 . add a tripod mount . 2 . move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that i can use an external microphone . that would be sweet . 3 . improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations . the optional settings do nothing to improve this . i tried them all . bottom line is that i would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount . there are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use .
1	i am new to slrs and i cant belive how good this camera is . this camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared to this .
0	do n't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers . i 'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 mp nikon coolpix sq as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop . what 've i 've discovered , however , is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 mp images from this hp camera that the additional resolution is worthless . the images look absolutely horrible . my little nikon sq with it 's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size . do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you 're buying is a good one
0	the zipper was broken within one day , and the hook was broken within two days
0	my frame freezes after displaying a few pictures . the remote does n't work . there is no website for contact or support
0	i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera . in the end , it came down to panasonic 's fx01 and cannon 's sd600 . i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic 's images were n't top quality , but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600 . i was wrong . after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera to be great , but it just was n't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera to amazon ( very easy-great service ) because of the poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs is why you take photos , right ? i know someone with the sd600 and he 's very happy with the quality . judging by the customer images on the sd600 's page on amazon , i think i should 've gone with cannon
0	el producto es de muy bajas caracteristicas . material barato , zoon de baja calidad , en otras palabras es sumamente inferior a otros equipos que he probado los cuales se encuentran en el mismo rango de precios . kodak tiene una linea de camaras económicas las cuales paracen ser desechables . no lo recomiedo
1	i have n't used it much but the few photos i have taken are excellent . i 'm not a photography expert so i 'll leave the technicalities to others . telephoto capability is increased noticeably but not a huge amount . the high quality of this lens , as with the wide-angle , is obvious . comes with caps and a storage bag
1	after waiting months for an order to be filled and then getting screwed by customer service/returns , i decided never to buy from amazon again . go to an electronics or camera store , you 'll get better service and the fresh air will do you good
1	can someone who bought the kit from adorama tell me : 1 ) the battery is the canon genuine nb-1lh battery ? 2 ) the camera case is canon psc-50 case ? thank you in advance
1	this is a very good camcorder with the main problem i noted being the dvd format giving only 30 minutes or so of recording in hd mode per disk . it is also a problem that only blue-ray dvd players can play back the dvd in hd mode . even worse that it might destroy the disk if you use it on another player . nevertheless , the price was good and i think blue-ray will be more affordable in the near future . meanwhile , i can playback my video directly or send it to the computer . i am glad i bought it . if a minidv tape version were available at the same price now i think it might be better to stick with the tape version for now though . i was sent a bad power supply with the camcorder but sony sent a new one right away . be careful to buy the correct battery and external charger accessories for the camera as it is a bit confusing as to which will work for it . overall - i am very happy with the camcorder
0	this was the first digital camera i purchased . i am an adventurous person and wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle . this camera was n't it . the good *it is compact , which is pretty convenient *it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy . the bad *after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes , the camera leaked and broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over . *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use . rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want . the pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . *the zoom sucks . do n't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience . *the image stabilization is a joke . you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that are n't blurry . *the user manual left me with a lot of questions
1	all i can say is , if you know what you 're doing ( basic knowledge in digital photography ) you 'll love this camera . adobe photoshop would be nice to have , too , if you like to play around with the pictures to make it more better . have fun
0	fuji fails to honor warrantee - do n't buy from them do not buy the fuji digital camera . they charged me $ [ ... ] for a fix within the warrantee period . their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears . rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee . [ ...
1	very happy with the lens , and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself
0	if i could , i would give this camcorder a 0 of 5 . since i now have to search for a new camcorder , from reading other panasonic model reviews , i am convinced i did not just get a lemon , but the panasonic brand is bad . we bought this camcorder 18 months ago at the birth of our son . it has had problems from the beginning . first , i could not finalize the disk . i called panasonic support , who basically told me the problems we were having were because the camera was not being held still while recording . this is ridiculous since i often set the camera down on a countertop so i can be in the video . then i finally got someone to tell me that i needed to be recording on panasonic mini-dvds . the best it has worked have been on the panasonic dvds which are some of the most expensive , and even that is no guarantee that you will be able to watch the dvd after finalization . i still have freezing of the picture and sparatic playback when trying to watch . it has skipped over whole sections . i have 3 dvd players in my home ( all different brands ) and the disk works on none of them . i finally got an address to send it in for repairs . i was not happy to be without my camcorder for an extended period of time . i was told they would look at the camcorder , see if there was a problem and call me . i waited a week after i knew it was in the shop to check the status . panasonic failed to mention that i would need to pay $ 207.50 up front for them to look at it , then if any repairs were needed , this cost would cover them as well . so , i have been without a camcorder for 3 weeks while waiting to see if it needed fixing , and the company i sent it to has not even looked at it because i have not paid them ! this is crazy since i can get a brand new minidv camcorder for $ 225 . the only reason it has taken me so long to take drastic action is because we are military living overseas and bought it at best buy . so you see why i could n't just take it back to the store ( or i would have a long time ago ) ! also after spending over $ 500 on this piece of junk , i could not afford to just replace it . sending it in was not an option when my son was a newborn , because i did n't want to miss any precious memories ( which i ened up missing anyway ! ) . so now the holidays are upon us , and i will be forced to purchase another camcorder , since i do n't know if they will send it back to me in time for christmas . i will not pay the $ 207.50 for a camera that has n't worked well out of the box . i also had to pay shipping both ways for nothing ! plus another thing , the still picture is bad quality . very grainy and you can actually see pixels when you print it . we only used that function once . i have lost so many disks , and have so many others that only play part of the dvd that when i think of it i cry . i have also wasted so much time trying to figure out how to fix the problem with a customer support that is useless . i wish i would have never bought this camcorder ! if you are buying this camcorder to capture memories , buy another ! i will not buy panasonic products again !
0	description or product is wrong . there is no quad independent power/charging indicators . they are set up in banks of two . one light for two charging bays . batteries must be charged in banks of two . tried e-mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger . e-mail came back as undeliverable . can not find any reviews on the internet for this charger
1	i 've been using this directional mic for almost three years and have never noticed camera noise . it 's compact and provides a good reach for most ambient sound situations
0	a great idea poorly executed . the construction is cheap . the screen is marginal at best . but worst of all , it refuses to recognize any of the 3 digital cameras i have on hand or a usb card reader . a piece of junk that i am now returnin
1	xti is feature laden , but takes fantastic `` point and shoot '' photos . seems to be a significant improvement on canon 's rebel xt , a wonderful camera . for the money , the best slr going
0	i used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it . it took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more , then nothing for the rest of the roll . we swam with sharks and i have nothing to show for it . should have bought a disposable one
1	i liked this lens . i used it , for the first time , while traveling through peru . it was light-weight and easy to use . at 200mm , most of my pictures turned out great , especially when i was on steady ground ( taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge ! ) . i 've printed some 8x10 's of close-ups i took using this lens and i was quite impressed with the quality . it was also in my price range . overall , i 'd say it was a `` good bang for the buck .
1	it 's good as my title says , however , i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off
1	when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery . they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes . now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime , a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good `` business '' choice . so i said no . so i got the camera , charged the battery until the light went green ( which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it ) and started taking pictures ( oh i also got a 2g cf ) worked great ... .so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots . keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong , still have 200 shots left for the trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button . so all in all , i think the battery life is great , now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point , the original will work fine . as for the quality of photos ... ..i love them
0	loved this camera the first month or so that i owned it . two years later my feelings are very different . batteries need to be recharged constantly . camera rarely turns on after being off it 's dock for more than an hour . all i can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying . zoom is worthless , pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated . flash is also way too bright , half of my pictures are annoyingly `` white '' looking because of this . definitely going with canon on my next purchase
1	i purchased this camera 2 weeks ago . i love using it . it has lots of function to play with . it is easy to use . i didnt have trouble taking good pictures in zoom mode outdoor . indoor , i had to use tripod if i use zoom . however , i cant really think of any occasion that i have to use zoom indoor other than my testing last week . besides , it gives great pictures and i loved the price . i kind of considered dslr camera but i gave it up becasue lenses were more expensive than camera itself . i considered one wide angle lense and one zoom lense . it would have cost me almost 2000 dollars so far , i love this camera . if this helps to anyone considering buying this camera , id give two thumbs up .
1	this is a great , easy to use camera . i have had this camera for a year and it has seen alot of use . the only drawback i have had with this camera is that it eats aa batteries . i bought rechargeable aa 's and they seem to last forever ! problem solved . i am about to purchase a second one for my son for christmas . great camera
1	if you are looking for a great all around camera , this is it ! our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all . also love the `` last 4 '' feature , gets some great action shots . we had the fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me . love the new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) as well as the battery drain . i used to have to replace batteries every day , now its more like once a week with the amount we use it . my other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where i forget to put it back in the camera after downloading ! so there is always one in there ! . the video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots . in general , without spending a lot more , you get a great camera that keeps up with an active `` picture happy '' family
1	outstanding service . product as advertised . excellent packing job . arrived in record time . would buy again from this seller
1	i have had this bag for a year and recommend it . i use it all the time . it 's a great walkaround bag . the first time you 're in a place where you want to get to your camera quickly or do n't want to put your bag down you 'll appreciate the sling design . just be aware for a long mountain hike you may feel the weight on your shoulder after some time . my only error was getting the 100 - i should have gone with the 200 , and plan to do so . i like to keep my lens hood in place which requires a little more room . i 'd also found that i need a little more room for non-camera things . a word on the all-weather cover - a great feature . a few weeks ago i was in bermuda and walked to a beach about 25 minutes away . just as i arrived a soaking rain began that did n't let up for the entire walk back . if i had n't been able to pull on the cover my equipment would have been soaked . now i would n't buy a bag without one
1	just returned from a trip to hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test . i was very pleased with the results . this is a powerful lens , yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use . i was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds , zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera ( canon eos 20d ) and virtually every shot was a keeper . the is feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus . usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one . i shot in both portrait and landscape mode and i did n't see any problems with focus , clarity or sharpness . all the images were clean and razor sharp . if you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment , i highly recommend this lens for your arsenal .
1	the binoculars were suprisingly lightweight for their size and power . the 70mm lens were great at light gathering , and the 4.75 mm exit pupil provide more light than most adults can use . ( the avg . is 3-4 mm ) with a good strap is easy to wear for long periods and excellent for long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use . you really need a tripod to use the full power effectively , but for short periods those with steady hands can enjoy the binocs on the fly
1	great seller ! shipping was very fast ! this battery out does the oem one that came with the camera ... very happy ! thank
1	this is a great camera . the quality is good and the camera is very durable . i 've accidently dropped the camera several times , and it still works . however , i would suggest getting a memory card if you want to take more than 24 pictures at a time .
1	from a pure image quality standpoint , this lens will not please the pixel peepers . on the wide end of the zoom , which i personally use more often than the telephoto end , this lens is not very sharp , and it suffers from fairly bad distortion . worse than that , for me , are the chromatic abberations ; this lens is quite prone to significant ca when shot at the wide end , which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness . given the price of this lens , one should expect a higher level of optical performance . the maximum aperture of this lens is not very large , being f/4 on the wide end , and f/5.6 on the telephoto end . the image stabilization makes up for this some , as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let 's be honest here ; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod . the small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder , which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark ( using a tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , and this is not without reason . first of all , the focal length range is quite handy . it is n't a mega-zoom that does everything , however , it covers the most often used focal length ranges , and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations . the little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion , and it 's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end , but zoomed in , it 's quite good . i have printed as large as 20x30 '' using this lens on a digital rebel , and have no qualms with the results . yes , there are sharper lenses out there , but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print . this lens has ring usm , which enables it to focus very quietly , and very quickly , whereas the slightly cheaper ( and f2.8 ) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison . if you want to use this lens indoors , you are best off getting a flash to go with it , such as a 430ex . the lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting , or during the day , but wo n't give you good results in low light with no flash . if you will be shooting in lower light situations ( people in particular ) , tamron and sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with f2.8 apertures , and i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you 'd prefer the extra telephoto range , the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field ( instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f/4 , for instance , without image stabilization , you could use f/11 on this lens , and get a sharp picture with better depth of field . this is even more useful in the close focus range - while this is n't a true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without a tripod , you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field , and the is helps with that quite a bit . overall , i 've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens . if you like to worry about splitting hairs , and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer , this lens is likely to dissapoint you . if , however , you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded , useful lens , then i 'd recommend it , however , would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options , as they are also great lenses , and do offer a somewhat better value
0	when mated to a sony wide-angle lens , the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo . a major flaw in my opinion . sony makes no mention of this on the packaging
1	the camera is a superb , light-weight wonder . the controls are logical and the large display area is amazing . i love it .
0	the charger unit or the batteries ( or both ) do n't work right : i use the batteries one at a time , in rotation to power my zen mp3 player . sometimes i put discharged batteries in the charger , plug it in , the light blinks red , then goes off . only supposed to show either red ( discharged , charging ) or green ( fully charged . ) this morning 3 batteries show fully charged , i take one out , it is discharged . all these problems happened with a first unit , i returned it to monster and after they took their sweet time , got a replacement which works just as erratically . monster 's stuff looks good , but it is the last time i am going to buy their brand
0	i had an s5000 but it dropped it and broke . so i decided to buy this model since i loved the s5000 so much . they took away so many of the great options and quality that the s5000 had ... so now i just use a small fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf . it is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control . i would suggest going with the s5000 even with lower megapixels it is much better quality
1	purchased as a gift and well received . seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner . runs everyday , all day and no problems encountered . displays vacation pictures clearly . like that it is big enough to view across the room . frame is more compatible with decore than the 7 '' model previously purchased
1	had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it , have'nt regretted it one bit . this lens is clear with excellent color , saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing . coupled with an external flash it 's great indoors as well . have been using it as my everyday walk around lens . zoom range is excellent ( rebel xt/xti 1.6 magnification ) . though it 's somewhat on the big side , it wo n't tire you out carrying it around your neck . purchased the hood seperately which , for the money should have came with the lens . anyway , this lens offers excellent value for the money and you wo n't regret the investment
0	when i received the camera i thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture . after 6 months use , i wish i could give it a 0 star . it 's true it looks good but it 's very hard to hold the camera . it droped twice when i took pictures . also the lens is too small . the dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it 's small . thanks the dirty lens , the picture quality is worse than ever . the battery is very small too . after 6 months use , it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures ! they have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space . it 's not a user friendly camera .
1	after checking prices with all the usual pricing bots , i found a better price , including free shipping , by going directly to amazon . this lowest price did not appear in the other searches , so it pays to go to amazon first . i replaced my canon sd400 with the casio and find the controls more logical to use . this is important if you do n't use the camera for a while , because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual . also , the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera . you do not have to remove the battery in the casio to charge it as you do with the canon sd400 . the vga movie quality is superior on the casio . still pictures appear to be about equal . amazon delivered by ups in record time even with a weekend inbetween . i ordered on a friday and received it the following tuesday . go with amazon !
0	i ordered a case for my kodak dx6490 digital camera from antonline thru amazon but received a case that is inches too small for my camera . if the numbers referenced above show in the review , you can see that my model of camera does not appear . in spite of this antoline has refused to issue an rma for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if i return without their rma . they tell me it can not be sold as new since it was opened . the only packaging was a brown padded envelope . is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it ? i guess i could go to the airport and put it through the screener . there is a little tag on the case that reads dx6490 but it obviously is not since the size is incorrect in height , depth and width and my number does not appear on their invoice . when i checked kodak online , the dimensions for my camera case were larger in all three dimensions . amazon is attempting to resolve the matter but as yet have no feed back from them either . at this point i would never patronize antoline again
0	i received pandigital 7 '' photo frame ( dpf70-2 ) as a christmas gift and have n't been able to get the sd card slot to function . when connecting to the pc via usb cable it tells me the removable device needs to be formatted . windows attempts to format the card and fails . i 'm able to format the card with a usb card reader and copy pictures to the sd card ok . when i insert the sd card into the photo frame is does n't display any of the pictures , just a blue frame around the picture location . i contacted pandigital tech support via 800 # and never received a call back so i sent them an email . i received email response back after several days . they had me try several things to resolve the issue ; this troubleshooting process went on for more than week to no avail . they eventually acknowledged the photo frame appeared defective , when i asked to exchange the photo frame ( taking advantage of the 90 day warranty advertised on their site ) , they told me to return it to the store it was purchased . i do not consider this very good customer service ; i would not recommend this product .
0	bought this housing new in november 2005.in april i used it for the first time and it flooded on the first dive ! neither amazon ( since it is ouside the 30 day return policy ) nor canon will stand behind this product ! period ! i got so much run around from canon it was ridiculous . they wanted to `` evaluate '' the housing to determine if it was defective ... dah ? they would not tell me if i sent it back for the `` evaluation '' what the final resolution would be ( refund , rework etc ) . coincidentally , another person on the same trip had the same housing ... it flooded on their first dive too ! ! ! ! coincidence ? no . just terrible quality control and no product support from canon . do not buy canon products ! !
0	the idea is wonderful but the window is too small to be useful . i have it , have pictures on it , but never show it to anyone . trying to find the right light to illuminate a tiny picture was ridiculous . easier to show a few pictures in my wallet
1	i bought one of these items in december '04 from adorama . it had directions written in raised letters on the canister itself . i just ordered here and received a second one in march '07 and the `` new '' model has no instructions . other than that , it looks identical to the old one , so i assume the contents are the same . here are the exact words written on the old one : `` hydrosorbent 40 gram silica gel '' `` when pink , reactivate 3 hours at 300f '' the pink referred to is the little circle in the center of the canister . i keep this product with my camera ( in closed stuff sack ) and it seems to work as advertised - though i guess you just have to have faith that it does - no easy way to prove it ( except maybe in extremely humid climes )
0	overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your panasonic lx1 or lx2 camera , but it has a few major flaws . first , there is no simple way to attach it to your belt . there is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it wo n't fit any belt more than 1/2 '' wide . also , there are two zippers on this case , one on each side , which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket . finally , the velcro tab that closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own . this might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase , but not for carrying around for everyday use .
1	i agree with many of the reviewers -- in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb , but it is not quite as sharp as a tele -- as one of the reviewers said -- it does many things , and not all of them perfectly -- the lens is a compromise , but an excellent compromise -- the vr is an added boost -- i 'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back , because of the weakness in the tele -- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility. -- i do n't want to keep changing lenses
0	yes , it does provide a bit more eye relief , and can make it easier to see the whole frame ( by making it smaller ) , but there is a major problem with this . the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this , and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you . this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses .
1	i love the new digital canon . the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin . i had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working . the canon people have been great , and very helpful , but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory . the photos , however , are wonderful . film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable . ( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it , so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos .
1	after using both lenses i think this is much better . here are my reasons : 1- f 2.8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate . 2- bokeh is much better in this one . 3- macro is slightly better on this one . 4- 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size . 5- is is not very crucial in 24-50 range .
1	very easy to use . menuing is extremely intuitive . do n't forget to order spare disks , 30 mins goes by quick
1	the housing worked great . took it to 80ft scuba diving and with the flash on the colors came out ok. no leaks and access to all functions a plus .
0	it looks great , genuine leather , much better than synthetic . like a brand named leather wallet . but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera . hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos . there is no where to put the essential accessories ( battery and another memory stick ) . there is no way to clip to the belt . will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost . bought another handy synthetic case afterwards
0	this battery is not compatible with the the jvc-grd270us video camera . i did get a purchase price refund , but i am out shipping costs both ways
0	i purchased a nikon for my first camera , i just loved how you can take it anywhere , fits handy in your pocket and perfect size . i could n't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo 's . for my birthday i took over 100 photo 's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost . i was so devistated . the video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people 's faces . my friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo 's . so maybe i just got the short end of the stick ... but this was my first camera so its okay for starters ... but if you love to take photo 's be full aware that on a low battery that it just might not want to hold them . a major plus i do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image ! that i 'll give 5 stars to ... everything else i 'd have to say 2 stars !
1	the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i 've ever owned . my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography . i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel . after a few months of owning it i still am amazed . the image quality is fantastic , it 's quick and responsive , and every day using it i learn a little more . it 's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it 's easy to learn . i 've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot . if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot , go for this camera , you wont be sorry .
0	please buy a different camera . i have owned 5 different pocket digital cameras . under normal wear and tear , the cannon sd400 's lcd screen broke where other cameras i 've owned have not . i just purchased the nikon s7c with a bigger screen that is so well protected that i can hit it with no adverse affect . if you do buy the sd400 , set aside the $ 150 you 'll likely need to replace the lcd
0	i bought this lens for my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find . i knew going in that this lens was n't perfect but , was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens . i liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization . i shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed . the pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull . i thought it might have been my new camera at first because i could n't imagine the quality would be this bad . i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i had for my canon film slr and the results were much better . for the digital focal length though , my old lens would n't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor . later , i decided on the tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews . the salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when i told him i had this canon lens . he said , `` let me guess , you 'd like to try the tamron 17-50/2.8 . '' he said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it . i could return it with no questions asked if i was n't satisfied . he also said that he had n't had one person return it yet . my first images with this lens were great . they were sharp and had way more vibrant color . there is absolutely no comparison at all . i was hesitant to buy a third party lens but , my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results . this is the first review i have ever posted on amazon . i was so dissapointed that i wanted to help others not make the same mistake . after spending $ $ $ on a digital slr , it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens . before taking a chance on buying the canon , do yourself a big favor and try the canon and tamron at a local store .
1	my cousin 's wife is a professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses to me for clothing / lifestyle photoshoots ( i 've been pretty active in this area for some time , just now starting to go full digital ) , and i 've used the f/2.8l about four or five times and this is one of the best lenses i 've used . period . shooting wide open allows you to retain high shutter speeds for night shots , as well as get very interesting and vibrant long shutter shots ( of crowds , the freeway at night , etc ) . when shooting action shots , the tripod mount can get in the way of zooming and focusing , but it can be removed easily enough . i personally just purchased the f/4.0l , which , coupled with a relatively wide max aperture and shooting at either 1600 or 3200 on my 20d , should do nicely , but i still rate the 2.8 high up on my list
1	i purchased this kit , primarily for the extra battery , which retails for about what i paid for this item . having the backup battery is great , but i was pleasantly suprised by the soft case . it protects my dsc-p200 , without being bulky or heavy . with the camera being so small , it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money . the case for the memory sticks is nice as well . it is easy to lose a stick if it 's just floating around and the case keeps them securely . all in all , this is an excellent value
1	i bought this camera in august . it is really well made and the controls are easy to navigate . i think it takes really good pictures , inside and outside . who cares about video quality ? its a camera , not a camcorder , lady . i think it is a really nice camera . its really durable too . and it looks nice . i would buy it again . i researched a bunch of cameras before this one and i chose the sony in the end . its one step up from just taking everyday pictures . they look really pro . i 'd buy it again
1	the new olympus stylus 770sw is the nicest camera to date i 've purchased . it takes great pictures and is extremely durable . the picture quality is awesome in all types of weather conditions and lighting . i stronly suggest to purchase this if the price is right
0	here 's the good news : i have had many cameras in my life , digital and film , and i have found the z1 to be my favorite . the camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color . my previous camera was a minolta dimage 7 ( $ 800 ) and i found that this camera 's photo quality was just as good . the best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily . owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life . here 's the bad news : recently my camera broke and when i tried to contact fuji to get a replacement or a repair , the service was terrible . their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support . summary : great camera as long as it does n't break . it 's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get fuji to repair it
1	great camera , only bad thing are the batteries die very quickly it takes great pictures and has some good features..
0	this camcorder is only good for outdoor recording . in indoor recording or recording in little bit low light , picture quality is very bad . i tried to record in my living room where i have two 100 watt bulbs but recorded picture was very blurred . in outdoor recording in a sunny day , picture quality is quite good with sharp colors . zoom works well
1	bought these binoculars for my husband . he loves them . they are very powerful and he loves the way they feel - not too heavy . he can look at stuff across the creek and is amazed at the clarity in the things that he sees
1	an excellent flash to use with my canon 20d at a fantastic price , the canon 580ex was an expensive option , but should i buy one in the future ? the 430ex is perfect as a slave unit . great product from canon as always
1	have had good luck with these batteries . they last for a long time . first time with amazon and it was a good experience . will use them again
0	my primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting , without the use of a flash . the camera could n't handle taking pictures without the flash at all , despite it being extremely bright in the room ( 5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights ) . the camera 's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that was n't blurry . maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear . i believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it . i used to have a cannon powershot sd450 that was awesome , but it was stolen and so i needed a replacement . i had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash , unlike the 900 . i am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose , this camera was horrible and it has since been returned . instead , i just got a fuji finepix f30 , which is supposed to be better without the flash . we 'll see
1	a little background first ... this was an upgrade camera for me , just over a year ago . i was in 35mm format for over 20 years . i used a pentax k1000 body and several different lenses , tele-converters and filters . at work , i 've had 4 years experience with a fuji fine pix 2mp `` point-and-shoot '' . it was provided by my work and was very durable ( it had to be , as i am in construction engineering ) . when i decided to switch `` personally '' to all digital i was very cautious . i first looked for pic quality and durability . from an `` advanced-amature '' photographer 's point of view , this camera is great ! ! ! this camera never leaves my side . it travels with me everywhere i go . it is extremely durable as it is mounted to an `` ultra-pod ii '' and i carry it over my shoulder ( i do n't keep it in a bag ) . it provides me outstanding quality pohotgraphs ( close , far or fast : work or play ) at a very reasonable price . it takes reasonable video ( considering my 35mm took none at all ) . it is easy to use and learn ( even for an old 35mm guy ) . it is lightweight and power usage is not an issue ( nimh is the way to go ) . i take close to 20,000 pics a year for work and play . i am always experimenting with this camera and it 's limits . i am so pleased with this camera ( and the previous fuji i used ) that my next upgrade will be a fuji as well ( looking to 10mp ) . for the $ $ $ you ca n't go wrong
0	i only had it for a few hours and after that i knew i would be returning it . its video quality is quite horrible , just better than a videophone and average of a webcam . i should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive . but honestly , i prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is . it 's quality will not be any better unless your outside , and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun , this would not do . you basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow . this also is a pain for mac users . it says it 's able to import files , and yes it can , but in asf format . now you can play it in vlc , but think you 'll be able to convert it , think again . it converts just fine , except without audio . i 've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio . so , mac users , pick something else . it is being returned , for certain
1	the battery is great , but amazon offers the accessory kit with the same battery , plus a mini-dv tape and a carrying case for the same price . the case is useless for the zr series , but might come in handy for some other purpose
1	the beauty of this charger is that it is 110/220v compatable , so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on european voltage . i have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each . very few cheap us chargers offer this multi voltage compatability . lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors . if you plan on traveling internationally , this charger is a must !
0	im not from usa . my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country . i lost 1000 us
1	i have been working for a major daily newspaper in baltimore for 2 decades . perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography . i have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s . maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography . this may be long- winded , but it 's extensive and can be useful . i received the nikon d2h camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago . i think i got them shortly after the d2h system was released in 2003 . since then , i have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , and dead- of- night -- for the paper i work for . this is the only camera i work with . first , please read the manual . there is a ton of information there , and the information is terrific to begin with . the d2h is highly- configurable , with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use ( resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time , for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera ) . i 'll just punch right in to the way it feels . the camera is a rather heavy beast , and for some , there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day , like i do . but the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through . i 've long since given up using any camera bag . all i have are a fanny pack for a 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt . and the d2h 's hold the 17-35mm nikon and the 80-200mm nikon one- touch or the sigma 120-300mm 2- touch . shooting is a breeze . the batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge . i have my d2h set on iso 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower iso as often as i can , because the higher isos bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation . just today , i purchased digital noise plug ins for photoshop to limit this , and that 's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at iso 800 and above . i now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting . i recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an airbus at 36,000 feet over the pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8 , and it looks tons better than night shots via the d1h , which lacked the internal digital noise filter . that filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures , and can make you wait as long as your image you 've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise . when you shoot this way ( and in general ) , do n't simply react by cranking up iso because you will not be happy with your results . the camera can be loud . at over 7 frames per second , it can make you obvious in a quiet room . shooting sensitive situations can be testy , so limit your shooting to single frames . i wish this camera had an option to silence this camera , but since the mirror has to raise and lower , there 's no chance to do this . am i happy with the d2h ? definitely , yes . are there improvements that can be made ? yes . but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks . people have been bailing out of using the nikon system and going canon , which has some incredible gear , i wo n't deny that . but instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment , learn how to use the d2h well and you 'll be much happier than ever . and that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations . for instance , white balance . this can be the best thing for you , or the worst thing you 've ever dealt with , depending upon how you approach it . daylight , grey skies , dusk and dawn are easy , because you can set the camera to daylight , flash , shadow ( for dusk and dawn times ) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark . but the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you do n't properly use white balance . preset white balance is king , here . i can get grey , black and white when i preset in mercury vapor light . and i used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting ca n't figure . there is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well ! if you do this ( and i can go on for miles here ) , you 're on your way . so , with trying this d2h , or considering it , read through some of the digital d2h forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances . generally , those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it . i can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail . when you have decent light , you 'll have a decent image . but when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system , you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable . in closing , i have not been paid by anyone , i have no nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that i 'm giving the d2h credit where it 's long overdue
0	i purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter . it is n't even good enough for a child 's toy camera ! she had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of . this camera looked like it would fit the bill . it was small and `` cool '' looking , had a dock ( great idea ) , li-ion battery ( great idea ) and a skin ( great idea . ) unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments ( we are not always outside in the sun ! ) if they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable . save yourself the grief and buy something else . i 'm getting a 5mp hp ( for less money even !
1	i owned a kodak for awhile and was pleased with the pictures however , my husband accidently fell while ice skating and broke my camera . my family , knowing i love to take pictures , decided to replace my camera , but this time with a sony cybershot . i have never been more unhappy with a camera . needless to say , i finally decided to purchase this kodak z650 and am so pleased with the results and pictures . i am not a professional photographer , just someone who likes to take photos of my kids , pets , flowers , vacation spots , etc . my sony was horrible at action shots and if you had any movement what so ever , the photo appeared blurry . having kids , that is n't an option . i gave that camera to my daughter to do whatever she wanted with it . the kodak , however does a wonderful job of action shots as well as clear , crisp and concise pictures . i absolutely love this camera ! i will never go back to another brand and have only good things to say about kodak and their products
0	dsc series camera all have a ccd imager defect that will leave screen blank after you use the camera for 2 or 3 years . ( do a google search . you will find out what happened . ) sony knew this problem years ago . but refuse to fix it . they will wait until the camera fail and then charge you $ 300 to fix it . that 's what happens to my dsc-f717 . ever wondering why dell , hp etc all recall sony battery for laptop , but sony did not recall their own laptop battery ? sony will never fix their own problem . we the customer have to pay for their mistake .
1	the battery is great and it 's pretty nice to own two of these , so when one battery is discharged i can just pop in the spare . it was in stock and delivered to me in a reasonable amount of time
0	amazon replaced the original coolpix p3 because of technical defects but the new one has worst problems . this one does not even focuses at all . i dont know what to do now because there is no technical service for nikon in my country venezuela or latin america . i basicly lost my 300 dollars please answe
0	polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some `` pop '' out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , `` it is canon , it must be quality . '' since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance
1	am very pleased with all aspects of the camera except one . i do not like that the viewfinder is no longer operational once you flip open the lcd screen . sometimes i like to verify my shot with both
0	my camera has broken in less than one year of owning it . because i received it as a gift i do n't have the proof of purchase so kodak will not fix my camera for no cost . what a lemon the cx7300 is . first of all it takes pictures so delayed you never really get a good candid picture . what 's broken ? i can take one picture before the batteries go dead . i change the batteries , one picture . change the batteries again , one picture
0	hi , i have had the vdr-d300 for about 6 months now . i have never gotten a recording session to last more than about 20 min . the camcorder constantly locks up , usually after about 10 min . this is on a full battery - the unit never gets even to a battery alarm . several times the reset button nor the reset proceedure per the manual works . i must have a faulty unit . i 'm investigating repair . the unit has a great lens , camera , and video image , but my unit is not stable at all
0	i measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with la crosse charger , which i also bought from amazon . the capacity ranged from 547 mah to 2002 mah , with the average being 886 mah . that 's about a third of the stated capacity . before i took the measurements , i made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of aa nimh batteries : la crosse and energizer . both scored very close to their stated capacity . therefore , the test is valid and sunpak 's claim of 2650 mah is grossly overstated . my advice : avoid sunpak like the plague !
1	i really enjoy this small , high quality camara . i purchased a 2.0 gb memory disk so i could take advantage of the 7.1 mega pixel.and i get great pix everytime . i have lots of fun with it . since its so small , it 's easy to take everywhere with me . i also get lots of compliments on it 's `` fashionable '' sleek design . i highly recomend his camera .
0	1 year old ... 3 e18 errors 2 battery erros shipped back for service 4 times ! search the net for e18 before you buy !
1	i purchased this camera so i could photograph wildlife on hikes . i needed something that was not too heavy , was image-stabilized , with telephoto power . this camera meets all those requirements . it does have one problem , however . in bright light , the viewfinder blanks out , so one can not clearly see the object to be photographed . i have solved that problem to some extent , by pointing the camera at the object , and letting the autofocus do the rest . this `` fix '' has resulted in many excellent photos . like many other small cameras , the results tend to be contrasty , and i modify this tendency in photoshop
1	having been engaged in 35mm photography for 32 years , i approached digital photography with great reluctance . i knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures , like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid -- this further delayed my plunge . finally , an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue . my choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006 . we ran them as a screen saver , and i was much impressed by the sharpness , color tonality , and depth of field -- especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares . faces far into the background were discernable . i asked what was used and it was this camera . at the camera store i was heartened to see it felt like a mini slr in the hand , had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated , straightforward controls . the learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts . lack of no-shake feature is the model 's biggest downside ; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects . some of this you learn to shake out using point focus , but you still are going to lose a few precious moments despite your best efforts . nor with the limited equivalent asa range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good slr and high speed film -- but remember , this one is a starter . this thing is a monster battery eater , too : always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you . on the plus side , choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature , and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects . speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals , i do n't know , but its a whole world superior to my old world . there is a rather steely patina to even the best color images , i see now after viewing hundreds , but that 's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity . incidentally , the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating . back from europe this week , i have 2000+ jpegs ( the keepers ) all of very high quality , an achievement i could not have come close to , i am sure , either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals . the continuing issue of shake and blur i surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot ( sometimes 5-7 images ) ; you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them , and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off . i do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera , but even after i move up i think i will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world . for the price , this is about as good a deal as one can hope for .
1	i have sticked with sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago and sony camera has been the moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 is the one for the parent who is carrying to much already and needs to pack down for a change . it fits in my purse and still have space for more , the only thing to remember to buy a slim fitting case for the camera and an extra battery ( for those kind of battery are not sold everywhere ) you need that one when you do n't thing you need an extra battery , you always run out at the wrong time . i recommend this one
1	reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools . an imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer . i am not a master , but i do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are . when you use iso settings higher than 200 you will see increased noise . i think it is a great little camera and i have used it a lot on my latest photo project . keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size . this also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability . there is no way to compensate for this in the camera - so know this is a limitation and deal with it .
1	300 plus minutes of recording time ( without lcd ) . i still got several hours with the lcd , backlight on . for when you are out all day , this is a good long lasting battery . on the hdr-fx1 i found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting . that helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me . i ca n't say i noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height , though i did n't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time
0	i have been using this cord for about a year , and i had problems with its durability . it actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months , but then it started to fall apart . when mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket , the thin plastic shoe ( where the flash is attached to ) developed a crack and eventually broke off , making it useless to mount the flash . i had to buy a replacement part from canon ( who charged me $ 16 for this small plastic piece ) . i flipped the flash carefully from then on , but then it still cracked ! ! i wrote to canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic . so far , there is no response . a few months later , the cord , for some unknown reason , makes my 550ex flash switch from the ettl to ttl mode , and making the flash fire at full power , overexposing the entire image . i checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera 's hotshoe , and the flash worked fine , switching back to the ettl mode . for a piece of equipment from canon , it 's hard to imagine it giving so many problems . it 's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories . as there are no other oem manufacturers of this cord , i am forced to get another one and hope for the best .
0	my title says it all - i was really disappointed with this camera , but before i get into the specifics as to why , i must mention a few things first . this was my third camera in the exilim line - prior to purchasing z850 i have owned z60 , as well as z600 . both were great cameras . i mean , what 's not to like ? clean , sexy look ; easy to use ; great picture quality . but having to work for kodak in the past , i decided that i want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing , and in order to do that i needed something with a little more manual control , so i sold my z600 , and got a z850 instead . big mistake ! i ordered it directly from amazon , and it was a brand new camera . right of the bat i got a defective unit ! the problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures , especially close-ups . the shots were blurry for the most part , and the colors were a bit off as well . how is that for quality and reliability ? ! but i thought to myself , `` it 's okay , it happens '' , so i returned it back to amazon ( thanks to their great return policy ) , and got myself another one , this time from techtoysforless ( it was a lot cheaper comparing to amazon ) . one thing to be aware of - techtoysforless sells what it 's called `` grey market '' cameras . i knew about it ahead of time , but someone might not , and then be unpleasantly surprised . for those who do n't know what it is - the `` grey market '' refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer . only new products fall under the legal , accepted definition of grey market . grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods . frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another . this situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment , such as cameras . entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply , often at retail but sometimes at wholesale , import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there . so , the product is legal , it 's new , and it 's cheap . but ... in some instances , there could be minor differences between the `` authorized '' product , and the `` grey market '' one . for example , a `` grey '' z850 does n't have an ebay mode , but offers an `` auction '' mode instead . it 's a bit different with respect to settings . also , there is no full blown manual in the box , but rather a short `` how to '' instruction in various languages . however , the full manual can be found on a cd-rom . another difference , and that 's actually a plus i think , is that it comes with a european power adapter , whereas american sold models do n't have that . the biggest concern with `` grey market '' products , however , is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty , so you have to be aware of that , and check before buying . i knew all of the above , but still took a chance , mainly because the price difference was significant , but also because techtoysforless had a 10-day return policy , and i thought that it would be enough time for me to `` explore '' the camera and find out whether it 's defective or not . in any case , i placed an order , and three days later held a new z850 in my hands . i did n't waste any time , and when the battery was fully charged , i started taking shots left and right . all of them were crisp , clear , and sharp , so i knew the unit was good , and the lens was n't defective as it was with the previous one i had . however , and i noticed it right away because i tend to take mostly pictures of people , the colors were a bit `` warm '' . what i mean is there was a slight cast of `` pink '' present in all pictures . you would n't notice it in pictures of architecture , food , or nature , but people 's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural , and it was very obvious . neither z60 , nor z600 had that problem . i still kept the camera though because i could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing . what finally made me gave it up ( i sold it on ebay ) , was the casio 's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a `` broken '' movie mode . the original firmware , version 1.0 , that the camera came with had a problem with `` stair stepping '' - the movies were `` jerky '' , and `` noisy '' . after numerous complaints by the customers , casio released two new firmware versions , 1.1 , and 1.1b that supposedly `` fixed '' the movie issue . but what they in fact did was just `` cripple '' it - the movie angle was cut by 40 % in version 1.1b , and the picture quality actually got worse ! version 1.1 did n't actually fix anything , but rather `` improved '' already decent picture quality , and added support for high capacity memory cards . also , i 've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning , there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality . i did n't want to wait to find out , so i got rid off it . i did n't do my usual pros and cons type of review in this case , and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera , but it actually does have a few good things . for one , in addition to its big , super-bright display , it has a viewfinder ! a big plus in my opinion , especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine . also , on top of its numerous preprogrammed best shots , it has some manual controls , giving you even more flexibility . it 's a nice little camera . unfortunately , it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability . i wish i could say that i enjoyed using it , but it was more of a hassle than fun . however , i still stand behind casio products . after i sold z850 , i got myself a p700 model , which has been discontinued for some time now , and is virtually impossible to find anywhere . it 's a semi-pro model , and offers even more manual controls than z750/z850 models . excellent camera ! a true performer ! built like a tank , has a sharp canon lens , and made in japan for a change ! ( all other exilim models are made in china , which could be the reason for poor quality ) i 've used p700 for a couple of months , and ... sold it : - ) yep ... call me crazy , call me whatever you want - i just decided that i want even more manual control and flexibility , so i got myself panasonic dmc-lx2 . one word - wow ! what a camera ! optical image stabilization , wide angle leica lens , raw format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera . i 've had it only for 2 days now , but i 'm already in love with it . do n't forget to check my review of it , which is coming shortly . i did n't completely abandon casio 's though - my present to my wife for valentine 's day this year - casio ex-s770 in red color . i 'm definitely going to get my hands on it also , so come back for another review soon . once again , i hope i 've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions . good luck
1	camera has good features and decent battery life for a `` regular '' camera . for those of you who do n't need a special camera and just want something that can take decent pictures . this is a good one . i like it
0	i had jvc product and some of my friends too . these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem . even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly . price may be less buy its not worth for long run . i feel sony and canon are better than jvc . even hitachi is good
0	after just over a year , my lens jammed and the display read `` e18 '' . so i was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that canon refuses to admit . try googling canon s500 e18 '' , and you 'll see what i meant . do n't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight
1	for those wishing to purchase this product , and who also want accessory filters to protect the lens , or to add special effects , although not mentioned , the size of the filter is 30mm . ( not the 37 mm mentioned at other locations , which caused me to order the wrong size which now must be returned . ) remember , 30 ( thirty ) mm
0	i made sure i did my research and read all the reviews on various cameras before deciding to go with this one . i was highly disappointed when i got my camera home and put in the batteries , turned it on and immediately the lens got stuck in the `` out '' position with an error reading that said : lens error , restart camera . i tried to restart it a zillion times , only for it to say the same thing . i went on line and found that this is a problem with some canon cameras and now , instead of being excited about having this particular camera , i am completely disappointed . i 'm glad others have had such good luck with their cameras . please research the error because , in some cases , it did n't happen until a year later

0	yes , i have to agree with the previous review . it does n't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources . it does n't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything . if it was less expensive i would n't mind as much , and just chalk it up to extra protection . but that seems to be all it 's good for
0	i just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the c743 camera . the battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger . i think it 's odd , as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock . i 'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery . i do n't know whether the dock works okay , because i did n't get that far . this is my second easyshare camera and dock and i was very happy with the first one . now i have to buy another battery
0	like most people i got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image . i 've been pleased with the image quality when it works , but from the start it 's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment . sure enough : * the shutter cover has often stuck open or shut . * sometimes it refuses to start at all . * it sometimes powers on as you 're putting it into your pocket , which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera . * finally , the lcd stopped working altogether . this is after 8 months . casio has decided i 'm not under warranty ( no explanation as to why , no phone number to argue with them ) , and is charging me $ 97 to repair it . do n't be seduced ! it 's a poor quality product
0	this camera was great at first and very easy to use , however , the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well . when we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture , so we put it in our cedar chest ( we keep our house very dry and do n't live in a humid area - nebraska ) . this worked for a few months , but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless . i wish it was different , but bottom line , this is a disposable video camera - a nice one , but still disposable
1	this is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital slr camera and it was a good investment . i do n't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera . it also looks nice on my canon 30d camera , coupled with an `` l '' series zoom lens
0	the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 ( and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body ) . i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1 . with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out . if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera ca n't fit in the bag at all . there 's also no padding to speak of with this case . by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure , padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again . targus makes decent laptop cases , but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently . apparently it does fit some cameras , just not the panasonic fzs . considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
0	if you lose this cord just get a flash card reader . it 's cheaper and more practical
1	high iso and large screen were the reasons for my purchase . the screen is great but , when you force the iso 1600 , it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800 . i have a s5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an iso is set w/o having to go to full manual option . definitely something to improve ! the auto option seems to work much better and i was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works . also , the two picture function ( it takes two with slightly different sets automatically ) saves me on a lot of 're-posing
0	this one is a product of bad quality , the cap of the batteries to a few days i damage enough of light is needed in order that the sign meets slightly clear , product of bad quality i do not recommend it to him ( you , them ) and for quality the price must be low
1	this camera is excellent one ! ! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category , i 'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. highly recommended
0	this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter , it produces flare in the picture . furthermore , after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9 % light loss vs multi-coated filters like hoya s-hmc or b+w mrc filters . as for polarizer effect itself , i think it 's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day . ( the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive
0	im not from usa . my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country . i lost 1000 us
1	i have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it . it is as fantastic as others note herein . the 2.8 through the focus range is really great . superb . the vr function is really a neat trick . it is super fun to play with . the drawbacks are size and weight . after a 1/2 hour of shooting , your arms will get tired . remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera . this lens is definately heavy enough to bend/warp the camera body
1	i would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to take video and pictures without the hassle of lugging around ( and charging ) two separate gadgets . it takes excellent pictures , just as good if not better than any other digital camera i have seen . i am also very pleased with the video - i found the software very user friendly and video was easy to transfer and edit on my computer . the battery has a good life , i have had no problems having to stop and recharge it . there is a nite mode that compensates ( very well , i think ) for low light video . the camera is easy to carry around ( it is smaller than my 35mm ) and i am having no problems with the functionality - all in all a great idea and easy to use with great pictures and great video
1	this camera is amazing . out of the 3 digital camera 's under $ 150 i 've used , this is by far the best , beating out the kodak and the sipix . i originally bought the sipix , and it was junk . do n't buy the sipix that 's under $ 150 . the kodak for some reason did n't seem like it took as good pictures as the finepix , but the software was a little better , being from kodak . this camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels , but i do n't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing . it comes with a 16mb removable memory card , so you can take around 49 pics at 1mp , around 24 at 2mp , and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution , or more on a lower setting . the lcd screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power , and the 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long . it has a nice , sleak design , and the software has no issues with windows xp at least . the only cons i could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2x digital zoom , which is pretty much useless , and i never use it , since it 's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer . so you can consider it not having any zoom . the software for it works well , but it could be better , options wise . the filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card , so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day ( since it creates folders based on date ) , you 'll have to rename each pic . but i hardly complain , since the pictures come out so incredibly well . i 'm so happy with this camera ! if you want a camera under $ 150 , this is the one to get . do n't even waste your time with the kodak , unless you want the one with 3x optical zoom , but that 's $ 200 . i use it for general purpose , taking pictures of freinds and such . once in a while i take a picture of a sunset at 2mp , and that will be photo quality printed on a full page . 1mp creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images , and .3mp will created good smaller images to put on websites . there 's no reason to buy anything else , go with the fuji finepix a200 !
1	order received in good time - no problems . battery lifetimes are short - not as good as first original from dealer , but twice as good as poorer choice batteries from other suppliers
1	i bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends . i have had if for more than one year , and it has performed above expectations under all conditions . the 1 minute video feature is great , and was an unexpected bonus ( since i did n't know about it when i bought it off amazon ) . the camera works great with iphoto and macos x. i bought a 512 mb card for it and so far it has been great . both my father and my father in law have the previous powershot s400 and they have had no problems with it . i figure at some point i 'll have to change the battery , because lithium-ions lose 20 % capacity per year , but so far it has worked flawlessly .
1	i took this with me recently to australia and shot landscapes as well as others , and the pictures came out better than the film cameras i have used recently , plus you do n't need a scanner . this camera works great , a must have for semi-pros . pros , wait for the new 1d . pictures come out great at 11x17
0	last march ( 2002 ) i bought this camera and it was wonderful , although it was `` refurbished '' by canon it worked perfectly . i bought also a new battery and a 48mb compactflash memory card and everything was working fine . 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired . now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for `` refurbished '' items is less than 6 months
0	i have owned this joke of a camera for over a year now , so as someone with alot of experience with it , i advise you not to buy one . i would n't reccomend this camera if it was only $ 19.95 and came with a free sledgehammer to take your anger out on it when you realize you just wasted twenty bucks ... - without buying a memory card , this camera holds a pathetic number of pictures at any setting above vga . - non hp memory cards are incompatible . - it eats up batteries , seriously . - it shuts off without warning for no reason whatsoever . - it will often not recognize rechargable batteries as being rechargable . at this point , i am shopping for a new camera because my m407 claims that brand new batteries are `` depleted '' and shuts off , lovely
1	this tripod arrived on time and in good condition . however i have to put the `` heavy duty '' in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well . the weight you can put on it is limited . however it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer
1	if you are expecting clear professional sound transmission , this is not it . that 's a wireless system costing $ 1,000 - $ 3,000 . this system is strictly for home none professional use . i think people were expecting this system to deliver the hi fidelity sound they hear on movies or tv soundtrack . professionals do not use this system . that is the reason for the low price . home movies only .
0	we just bought this camera to replace our minidv jvc-dvl500 that was bought in 2000 . in short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is very grainy and dark . i applied the workaround listed above , but found that i had to set the frame rate to 1/15 in order to ge the brightness that i needed which caused a very jittery image . the quality of this camera is something that i would expect for $ 200 , needless to say i am returning this camera today
1	i 've purchased other bags but this one beats all it was a great price to
1	i bought this for my new hdv fx1 camcorder , and it works great . unlike the century wide-angle lens , this is fully zoom-through . lens is .8x , which is less than the century and others , but just about right for hd -- since the fx1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out , this just gives it an extra boost , converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm . also , very little barrel distortion . in all a great lens . only drawback is that it 's a big ( heavy ) lens , but then , hey , it 's for a serious prosumer camcorder
1	i purchased this camera a year ago ( summer 05 ) . definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel , although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect . there are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera , but after a year mine is still working perfectly
1	for the money , you absolutely ca n't beat this lens . it 's very fast and sharp . not fast to focus , but what do you expect at $ 70 ? i have four lenses , some costing 4x 's as much as this one ... yet i use this one the most . anyone looking to step up from the kit lens , or anyone looking to buy a camera body w/out the kits lens should look to buy this lens
1	be careful when you use this lens because it does not have is ( image stabilizer ) so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than 1/8 of a second you are going to going to get some blur . this is why the lens is so cheap . this is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens . if you are really zoomed in and it 's cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case . this goes for any lens , but if you will be using the 300-mm end of this then use a tripod . it 's common sense , but i 've loaned out this lens and they complained to me afterwards
0	i returned this camera after trying very hard to like . picture quality ( movie or still ) is totally unacceptable . i did not even get one good still picture . forget about indoors video or still . the falsh and video light are useless . the overall quality of the camera is low .
0	i wish that i could review how well this charger works , but unfortunately i ca n't . the reason is because it was dead on arrival . i essentially bought a $ 20.00 ( with eek technology 's outrageous shipping ) brick . it never worked , ever , and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit ! at least i have the 4 batteries it came with , so it is n't a total loss . do n't make the same mistake . steer clear of this piece of junk
1	this digital camera is awesome . i have no problem with the batteries . i made sure i put the good batteries in ( no cheap ones ) . i looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price . i purchased this camera with the 1gb card with it . i ca n't wait to start using it when i go to san diego in march ... .. awesome digital camera ... ... you wo n't be sorry on this purchase ...
1	when i sow this in amazon and read the spec . and everything on it i knew this is exactly what i 'm looking for . it 's portable , handy , and it 's easy to use . the video has a great picture on it as well as the picture too . you can even download mp3 music and use it to make music video , or any music of your own . here 's what you do , output the audio to a power amp/ speaker so the performer will hear the music let the performer lipsink the music and start shooting the video . shoot different location at the same music and edit it whala you have just made the mtv music video
0	this bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets . quite small for the price . just paying for the name on the bag
0	so i saw that this product got 5 stars , so i ordered it ... ... when i got it , its like `` um ... is that it ? ? ? '' it 's really cute , and really well made , but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards ... also , there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it , also , the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all ... other than that , it 's cute , but not the best out there .
0	i bought this to replace my broken digital8 sony camcorder and the same sales guy who sold me the sony 6 years ago advised me to buy this jvc , on one single criterion : the near-infinite hard disk drive storage . this was almost the only claim that was actually fulfilled . summary : infinite recording time , disappointing image quality and control for the price , painful editing . not for the average imovie user . positive points : - the storage capacity : a dream . i thought that 7 hours of high-quality video would barely last two weeks of vacation . actually it took me months to fill them . mostly because , as with digital cameras , you can throw away all the bad takes at will . i decided i 'd keep all my previous good takes until i really would need the space , well ... i still have my best clips from 5 months ago in the camcorder , which means that i can always show them at friends and family on location , even if i do n't have my computer or dvd copies on me . - the size , weight and shape : perfect . you can take this camcorder anywhere without facing hard packing decisions . it 's small , feels rather rugged . i added a wide-angle lens and the bigger optional battery , which makes the camera 50 % bulkier but still manageable . the shape is great , at least for my hand size . i can really grab the camera properly in various situations of verticality and bumpiness ... the microphones are not that well placed though , and i often cover them with my fingers . - image stabilization : very good . by chance i shot a clip with my wide-angle lens in the way , which gave me a good fixed reference to see how the beast is fast and smooth at correcting unwanted shakiness . - ease of connection : the usb2 link is ok . i 'd have preferred firewire , but here we are not dealing with video streams but video files . btw , this allows faster-than-real-time transfer . a firewire link with the camcorder acting as a hard disk would have been great ... ok points : user interface , reaction time ( even if it takes a long time to get ready ) , optics , battery life ( with the 3 hour batt . - actually a 1.5 hours ) . negative points : - image quality : considering the price , image quality is disappointing . frankly . the viewfinder is flattering but color saturation is in fact low , and clips shot on sunny days seem sadder than they are as i found out after shooting for a whole week in yucatan . clips shot on my digital camera ( canon ixus 60 ) look better . there is also a lack of control on image quality . - digital camera : simply forget it . my phone takes better pictures . i 'd advise you to buy a 2mpix+ cellphone and enjoy the benefit of sending your pics and videos immediately to far-away family and pals . - file transfer and editing : pretty horrible with the originally supplied software . in marketing copy , mpeg2 files might seem nice as a target format , but we always have to edit our videos , and this is quite painful , whatever power-users might tell you . you are in for hours of conversion , except if you burn your raw takes , at the risk of boring your audience . i was going to write `` do n't buy this if you are a mac user '' . this is not imovie ready . i have both pcs and macs , it 's equally painful and disappointing , except if you buy yourself a real video editing suite . still , if you have a mac and an everio get yourself the wonderful mpeg streamclip free utility from squared 5 . it allows batch conversion of the everio .mod files into useable formats . you 'll have to buy the mpeg2 component from apple first and change the .mod extensions to .mpg prior to conversions . time- and disk-space-consuming but worth it , as the image quality is superior to the one generated by the jvc-supplied software . neat thing : leave your computer at home though you ca n't use the camcorder as an external hard disk ( it is write-protected ) you can copy the photographs from the sd card to the hard-disk , which means that with the everio , you wont need to bring your computer on a trip just to store the pictures from your digital camera . conclusion : given the choice , i wo n't buy this camcorder , mainly for the below-par image quality , as i 'm ready to cope with the complications of conversion and editing . but i 'd seriously miss the storage capacity
0	looks nice . unfortunately did not power up the camera , so i ca n't say much else . going to cost me return shipping at the very least . sorry i did n't buy the canon product instead
0	i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years . i was extremely happy with my olympus , but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i 'm expecting . this camera was such a disappointment . just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using the flash . i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash . ) plus , if you used the zoom at all , the pictures came out fuzzy . the first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! the store i bought the camera from would n't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy . so , i sold the camera and took a $ 100 loss . i 'd much rather lose $ [ ... ] than keep this camera
1	i bought two , one for me , one for my daughter . it is compact , user-friendly , it has nice sized screen . it comes with a charger ( i 've been told that some do n't ) . 6.2 mgp . video with audio . all this for a very nice price
1	after researching several cameras in this price range , i bought the rebel t2 last month . it has met my expectations and perhaps then some . after recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range , i partially regret spending what i did . it all comes down to what you need , want , and how many bells and whistles you like . for the money though , compared to the competitors , i still think i made a good purchase . after all , if i use it for ten years , which i most likely will , i will have surely got my moneys worth . bottom line : no complaints with it
1	i like that the protection filter is threaded so you can screw a conversion lens right over it , rather than having to use one or the other
0	this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy . here 's why : 1 . the objective is too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe . i suppose it is adequate for the moon , but that is it . the planets will appear as very small disks . one will be able to see saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small . forget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope . the observer will find it hard to look through ( very small eye opening ) , and will in most cases cause blurred images . the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . the barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope . 3 . the mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to `` shiver '' , which is very frustrating . even for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws . save your money for a larger scope with a better mount . jim `` konedog '' koenig , astronomy buf
1	i ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did . i have a stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade , an extra battery , and an extra picture card . there are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover . in the main compartment , a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money . ( it wo n't fit much more than that , though . ) it 's compact , stylish and functional -- i 'm glad i bought it
0	i bought this for my wife and she loved it . but it broke after the amazon return policy was up . i contacted the company by email twice and have not heard from them .
1	this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well . the build is solid ( metal construction ) . the glass is also descent quality . about the performance , it absorbs some uv light . the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable , probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me . now , about the one problem which is the internal reflection . i 've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation . the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure ( the surrounding environment ) . to put it in example ( which hopefully is easier to understand ) , when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection . as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture ( and not in the center of the picture ) , the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear ( if you move the light far enough from the center ) . and if the light is n't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection . but of course most of the time , a lamp at nightime is often very bright . but the point that i 'm trying to make is that the internal reflection does n't happen all the time during low light or night time . additionally , the internal reflection is n't only happening at night . it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example . basically same rule as above , on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area , and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear ( also depending the angle ) . but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation ( which is not hard to do ) . i 'm actually not a fan of lens filter ( any filter ) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object , but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens . and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you do n't have any filter for your lens yet .
1	had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a d60 , and now with a 1d mkii , but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350 , which is my work horse . due to the push and pull feature however , the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol ' montana land , so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while , and the f/stop is n't always desirable for certain situations . the 70-200 f/2.8 is amazing . the twist zoom is a little close to the camera , so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it , and imho , is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports . ( rodeo , nascar etc ) the clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away . i did a comparison of images from my 70-200 f/4 when it was new , and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper . i put an expensive filter on it , as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions , and i do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter , even though it is a good b so when i can , i shoot the lens with no filter if i require extreme detail . the 35-350l is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8 ... if it were n't for the difference in distance , this lens would be my one and only . oh , and i love the is . as it is my first is lens , i treasure is , but know i will not buy another distance lens without it
1	i own the stylus 710 that i have had since september of last year , and love it to pieces . little did i know olympus was relaseing this little monster onto the market 2 months later . it has all of the features and software of the 710 model , with digital image stabilization , but 5x optical/5.6x digital/28x total zoom , an upgrade from 15x total zoom ( 3x optical and 5x digital ) . the price is about the same , and actually an excellent deal here on amazon . the 2.5 '' color lcd monitor with histogram display and auto image rotation has been standard in the 710 and 810 , and the 1000 series , and i have not problem with it , i think it is comparable to all models in this range ( panasonic , fuji , kodac , hp ) . i the bright sun , no lcd is going to be really great . i have captured many fun moments with this camera ( 2 weddings , 2 vacations ) and love it . the diffence with the 740 model is the thickness is a bit bigger due to the bigger optical lense , but that is well worth the sacrifice , because having more optical zoom = better picture . i know , i tested this side by side with my 710 . pick this up , you will not be dissapointed . also , look at the 750 and the 760 models , both of which have optical image and digital image stabilization , but alter the zooms a bit . compare , and see what meets your needs . also , the olympus mastersoftware is very easy to use , and with panoramic feature , 3d , and extra art features unlocked by olympus brand-olympus stamped type h hd , this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own . you can edit photos on the computer , or right in the palm of your hand . both ways , this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time .
1	started to by a less expensive bag last january ( dec. now ) and i 'm shure glad i did n't . for the money this bag is a good one . it 's not flimsy and you can get in and out of it and the pockets easly . the tripod holder on top has been real convenient
1	i had used some third party batteries with 15 minute charger , that used to die for 10 photoes or so . this canon one seems to realllly laaast looong ...
1	i am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit . i bought the canon because it has facilities for an external mike . i am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another . first on the matter of tape drive noise : yes i can hear it if i put the unit up to my ear . but no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer . second , they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer . what they do n't tell you is that you need a firewire card and cable ( about $ 70.00 total at best buy ) . you can not simply hook up through the available computer usb port . fortunately , microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the xp os and minimal capture software called `` moviemaker '' . i am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit , i think it is a bargain . finally , i have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out . your thumb easily controls on/off and tape transport functions . it is really easy to use , at least for right handed users . all considered , i am satisfied with the product . of course , if it dies next week , i will have a different opinion
0	the wifi is a great idea ! the idea on paper sounds amazing , but the way you had to do it was horrible . it gave you no control over what pictures or anything . plus it was slow . the picture quality was horrilbe ! ! ! m y two megapixel cell phone takes better pictures than this camera . they look amazing on the lcd screen , but once you get them on the computer , they are fuzzy , grainy , etc . i would not recomend this camera to anybody . yes , it has some nice features , but the pictures are anything but acceptable
1	i was very pleased to find an 8 mega-pixel camera at such a reasonable price , ease of use and easy to use softwate for editing .
1	solid construction , good optics , nice sound . as mentioned by others , the output for the usb transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself ... a minor annoyance . all in all , this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for ... .
1	i got this cam as a gift and it is very nice and sleek and easy to use ! the pictures are nice and it is light and easy to have it with you everywhere
1	i gave this monopod to my boyfriend , as a gift , and it 's been perfect for his use . he videotapes his kids 's baseball and softball games , and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long . he did n't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down , so a monopod seemed like a great idea . he has loved it ! ! he says it keeps the camera very steady and it 's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing . he 's no professional , but he uses his camcorder a lot , and he 'll be happily using the monopod for a long time
0	this item was offered as a suggested accessory to the nikon monarch atb 8x42 waterproof binoculars that i purchased . i later also purchased the 12x42 binoculars . this harness can not be attached to either pair of binoculars ! the hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars . other than that the harness is a well made quality product
1	the bushnell powerview 12x25 is a fine , small pocket-sized binocular . since my wife is an avid bird watcher , we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power . our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell that we used for trips , so i researched , then bought this one from amazon for her birthday . she loves it . the viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact , which makes it easy to pack for vacations , yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country . we both highly recommend this , and other bushnell products
0	i bought a jvc mini dv just over a year ago . it now does not work . of course , the warranty has now expired and i am out of luck . spent $ 400 on this model . i do not recommend jvc .
1	i was able to use the canon ef 1.4x ii extender for some nature photography recently in wyoming . i shot elk in low light conditions so i was shooting pretty much wide open . the extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all . you could see the hairs on the animals heads . it 's fantastic
1	i bought this item for a present , and the person really liked it ! ! . he uses it to watch deer , and other animals . the focus is very good , and i am very happy that i bought this product !
0	i have n't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives . i have a fujifilm e550 camera which cost is usd 250.00 by this date . this lens cost is usd 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra usd 20.00 . that means you will pay usd 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera . for that price or less you can get a +10x slr like camera like the fujifilm s5100 or s5200 .
0	hi , i have lost the cd rom to download the movie from the camera . sony does not offer it for free on its website . you have to pay $ 70 dollars to get it again . that clearly disappoints me .
0	i am still giving this camera 2 stars because ... i may have used the wrong settings when taking photo 's . but ... i ended up with `` a lot '' of blurred and fuzzy photo 's . `` example ... when we went bowling , almost every photo was blurred or had those acid trip looking streaks . '' my biggest complaint is the battery door broke completely in half in less then 4 months of use . you might expect that out of a $ 30 dollar camera but `` not '' a $ 3 hundred dollar one . i paid $ 284.99 for the camera , $ 47.99 for the 1 gb sd memory card and $ 51.54 for the docking station and that did n't include s or taxes , they were extra $ $ $ ! my husband replaced this one for me with the kodak easyshare c743 and g600 printer dock and it 's a 7.1 mp and it takes better quality pictures that i can print @ home for less then this one . ( $ 249.95 w/free shipping handling and 1 gb sd memory card included ) from k o d a k online
0	my husband and i bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting . due to weather , the snorkeling was canceled , but we did end up using the cameras . one we used for regular pictures , outdoor only , beacuse there 's no flash , and it was okay , though the pictures were a bit grainy . the other i took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll , i could turn and turn the winder , and the film would n't advance , but it would let me take another picture . after fighting with it the entire weekend , i ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out , though these were grainy , too
0	after a few months use the camera got persnickety , often demanding upon startup that i restart it . now that the camera has completely broken down , with the lens fully extended and stuck in place , i think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate . another durability issue concerns the finish : the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review , flash , etc. , quickly wore off , and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera . not a big deal in itself , but annoying given the other problem . the lens is prone to strange flaring , especially indoors , where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame . several photos were ruined , or have required tedious photoshopping . otherwise , the lens is fine and reasonably sharp , although nothing to write home about . the camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models , e.g. , canon a610 . many frames are motion-blurred , as well . there are ways to avoid this , but i did n't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure , thank you . there are a few things to recommend it : not only is it relatively inexpensive , it has a lens significantly wider than the competition -- 31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm . those few mm 's make a big difference when you ca n't move back far enough to get everything in the frame . it is also quick in its operations ( except when hunting for focus , see above . ) the jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful -- bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost -- but generally everything looks good . skintones are good . still , with the durability issue , this one 's not worth it . lucky for me , unlike the other user who seemingly experienced the same type of breakdown , i did keep the receipt . anyone wan na buy a memory stick pro duo
0	after about 2 months of light use , the camera stopped working . also , the output format was very difficult to work with . absolutely will not work on a mac . the price is coming down greatly ... i saw it for $ 88 at target
0	i had a kodak camera for years that i absolutely loved . we took it ice skating and ended up falling on it . therefore , my family bought me this sony for my b-day and i have to say this is the worst camera i have ever owned . if you have any movement ( such as action shots or small children ) the picture always comes out blurry . what a pain ! also , the picture quality is horrible . i will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a kodak
1	this is a neat idea . you do have to have close up pictures to really be able to see them in the small screen . it was very easy to load the pictures and it is very handy to have with me to show others our most recent pictures
1	every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it . pretty infuriating , especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it . yes , you can always remove those on photoshop ( or cheaper yet , the gimp ) ; but is n't it cool when you look at a picture and say : `` that is it , nothing to do on it ! '' ? ? and it was n't just the sky . any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks . with this blower , greatly priced ( pity that adorama does n't have free shipping though ) , i put my camera on the tripod , pointed it down , squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs ! ! ! great buy for dslr owners
0	while the everio will work on a mac , it is with jvc 's movie program . it is not imovie ready . there is a very strange `` work around '' involving dvdrop that will make it work . not very pleased with what i feel is misleading information about compatibility with mac
0	in an email , adorama specified that the filter diameter was , `` 28mm . '' on the amazon.com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting ! either they do n't know their products or they do n't care about the customers . now i have to return it because of faulty information they supplied . please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25 % of the purchase price - an amount i feel is beyond absurd . i can buy this locally for a lot less ( even though i would have to pay sales tax ) . buyer beware
0	i bought this item as a gift , and it ended up becoming mine . i have to say , i am greatly dissatisfied . here are some main issues i am having with the camera : 1 . it is very poorly designed . the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant . buttons are really ugly , and operating the camera is awkward , and for some functions requires both hands to operate.. 2 . the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally . 3 . the worst , by far , is the picture quality . colors are just plain terrible . automatic settings are a disaster of photography . i have used a canon ( 2mp ) before getting this one ( 5mp ) . the canon was far superior in quality , colors , lighting.. i do n't need large files of trash , i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures . as a result , i am strongly recommending getting a different camera . i have had great experiences with canon ; and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too . but hp must stop making cameras , and indeed many other devices .
1	this camera works well , except that the shutter speed is a bit slow . the image quality is decent . the use of aa rechargeable batteries is also convenient . the camera is pretty sturdy . i 've dropped it a few times and it still works fine
0	i bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars . i have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit . the set i received did not have the extention straps included . the harness was the same as all the other harnesses i could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back . if you are buying these because of the extention straps , you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars . they were well made , just not the same item as shown in the picture
1	i have many traditional film slrs including the original pentax k1000 ( fully manual ) , canon rebel xos and a canon elph . when considering digital slr cameras the canon digital rebel and the point-and-shoot canon digital elph were at the top of my list . but at $ 150 less than the canon digital elph , the casio exilim ex-s series is a better buy with the the same features ( and in some cases a better execution of the same features ) . if you 're looking for a fun point-and-click camera that will record audio , avi movie files and digital pictures this is it . it takes about 15 miuntes to read the manual and you 're off taking pictures . pay attention when reading the manual and everything else will seem very intuitive . of all the cameras i have i use this one most often . other users have complained about the proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents are available right here on the amazon site , you just have to look . my back-up battery was only [ ... ] bucks . san disk 1gb memory cards are cheap too , [ ... ] online , [ ... ] retail . last , i agree with many users that a lock switch needs to be developed so that you can keep the camera from accidentally turning on when it 's in your pocket -- but remember many cameras have this problem/lack/this feature . i solved my own issues by buying a [ ... ] case with a belt loop
0	i do n't know what case others got , some have said `` too tight '' but mine was very loose . the camera is swimming around in the case , easily half a centimeter of clearance . not recommended . just buy the battery and wait for someone to make a good aftermarket case .
1	like others i have compared it in a scuba diving trip to the kodak max sport and this one had a few advantages : 1 . film winded at greater depth . 2 . the pictures came out clearer - not grainy and with better colors . do n't expect too much of it at depths below 8 meters since light wo n't be enough ( i used it on a bright summer day in the red sea ) . even at shallower depths colors turn blue/green without use of flash . i have taken it down to depth of 35 meters and the camera was fine , but would n't take pictures at depths below 20 meters . the pictures i took at shallow depth came out excellent
1	i took this case with me to my trip to new zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing . if i did n't have this case i would have missed out on amazing shots . it 's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well . i loved it so much i actually bought one for my sister as well . it is a great investment for anyone that does n't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos
0	this is a wonderful item if or when it works . it prints the pictures beautifully if it works . the trouble is that after using it for a little while ( and i mean a little while ) it will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink . i have messed with it and messed with it , for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this does n't work all the time . right now my printer wo n't work and i cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink are n't cheap . i think it is cheaper going down to walmart and using their instant photo machine . this is not worth the money or the aggravation ! ! ! !
0	this camcorder is terrible in just about every way : cons : - unacceptably blurry video ; the specs say it records at 640x480 , but it looks more like 320x240 ( if that ! ) blown up to vga . - noticeable aura around any dark shape on a lighter background . - awful light sensitivity ; forget about recording indoors -- no matter how brightly the room is lit , faces will come out too dark . the built-in led 's do n't help much ( and not at all at distances over 4 feet from the subject ) . - noisy zoom that gets picked up loud and clear by the microphone . - zooming goes in irregular steps -- completely useless while recording . - video lags noticeably behind camera movement ; when image stabilization is turned on , the lag becomes so atrocious that you ca n't tell when to stop panning -- utterly useless ! - when using av-in and av-out cables , the firmware has frozen on me a couple of times ; the only way to reset the camera was to remove the battery . - video encoding ( through the av-in cable ) produces an unacceptably noisy and undersaturated result . - the lcd display has a very narrow viewing angle ; anything more than about 10 % and you ca n't make out a thing . - still photos taken at the native 5mp resolution come out strangely grainy and uneven -- something like a `` sharpen '' effect gone wrong . i can get better looking pictures with my 2mp canon powershot a40 camera . - the manual recommends keeping the camera motionless for 2-3 seconds after snapping a picture ( that 's on top of the 3-4 seconds it takes the thing to focus before it snaps ) ; but you ca n't keep the subject from moving , folks ! welcome to the psychedelic land of image trails ... - flash photos come out with wildly different color balance depending on the color of the background . - the manual is a sorry affair -- only 17 pages long and does n't go much beyond identifying external controls and menu options . - i could go on and on , but i 'll stop now , as you probably get the picture ... pros : - the camera body seems sturdily built ; the controls also have a sturdy feel to them , as do the battery and the usb port covers . hmm ... it 's the only nice thing i can think to say about it . maybe a child ( think pre-teen ) could find this `` camcorder '' exciting as a toy , but i do n't see how it can be enough even for an undemanding person looking to capture occasional life 's moments on video
0	it 's unfortunate that with a name like canon , you expect a quality camera . that 's why you shell out the money for an item that you think canon will stand behind . unfortunately , this is not the case . i bought this camera to use in graduate school ( industrial design ) . i needed it to do research for my thesis . i figured between that , all the product photographs , and the need good portfolio pieces , spending the 500.00 on an 8mp camera would be well worth the investment . i was wrong . about a month after i bought the camera , it started to malfunction . the lens got stuck and would not come out . neither would it go all the way back in , so the lens cover would not close ( not only putting the lens in danger , but draining the battery as well . ) it was still under warranty , so i sent it to the canon service center in elk grove village , illinois . it was received , and i was informed that my camera would be returned in 7-10 business days . that was almost a month and a half ago . i have put my thesis research on hold because i do not have the proper camera for it . every time i call the service center , i am told that the `` parts are on back order '' . evidently they do n't know when these shipments are due in their center , so they do n't know when i will have my camera back . the best part is , when i called two weeks ago , they offered me a `` brand new '' s215 . the told me it was a great deal and that i should accept the offer because `` they never do that '' ( meaning they never offer a new camera for one in repair . ) i pointed out that the s215 was only 5mp , had a smaller screen , and cost nearly 300.00 less than my camera . i also reminded her that my camera was brand new when it broke and i had to send it in . today i was told that there was no information on my camera , the backordered parts , or when they could send my camera back . the woman on the phone asked me why i did n't accept the s215 that was offered , and when i explained and asked for a camera the same model as mine , she said they were not authorized to do that . i told her that i was going to spend the time originally set aside for my thesis research to write letters to both the service center and canon corporate headquarters , and she suddenly had a technician she could consult , and my camera would be back to me by the end of the week . i wo n't hold my breath , but a copy of this review will be sent to canon .
0	this kit is just junk . the deluxe blower brush is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size . there is a tweezers that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras . there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution . the lintless cleaning cloth is an about 3 x 5 piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away . this kit is not worth buying at any price , because it 's not worth the shipping charges
1	i 've been using the sigma 10-20mm about twice or three times a month and i am very pleased . at such a wide angle , you will most like need to `` de-fish '' your final shot which can be remedied with cs2 or some other image processing software . at 10-20mm , the range is almost too wide , but after further usage , i got used to it . i 'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to . the only drawbacks i know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare ( despite the marketing by sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare ) and the biggest aperture is f/4 which is variable pending on the focal length . it is not a fixed aperture lens . i also find that this lens is at it 's sharpest around f/8-f/11 and i would n't go beyond that because i started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens . but other than that , i 've been pretty satisfied for the price i paid for this ultra wide angle lens . i still would prefer nikon 's 12-24mm , but i 'm not willing to shell out that much money on a wide angle lens . sigma 's price for their 10-20mm is acceptable
0	they have made several changes - some good , most bad - since i bought my last sony handicam in 8/2003 . first of all , there is no carrying strap . this is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera . i managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain . the docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer , you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes . this messes up my editing program . fortunately i still have my old camera . the ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge . while i was told most people prefer to use the led screen ( i do n't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you ca n't see clearly in bright sun ) i like to use the viewfinder . it no longer has a tilt up feature so i end up mashing the battery into my cheek . this last complaint is about the batteries . sony lied about the amount of time that a battery will hold . the 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera . that 's slightly more than 3 hours ; it is nowhere near 5 hours . the 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either . their packages should be accurate . all in all , it is not as good as the older product . there also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec . button is not being pushed . this will be my last sony unless they make major improvements
0	i purchased this camera for my own birthday present last october . i have owned it for 1 year and 2 months and now it is n't working . i paid $ 400.00 for it last year when it was `` new . '' the lcd will only turn on every 15 - 20 times after i take the batteries out and turn the camera on and off . i purchased new rechargeable batteries , but that was n't the answer . i contacted panasonic but it is out of the warrantee period . they will charge a flat $ 140.00 to fix it and i can get a new one for about $ 150.00 . i loved this camera , but it is such a disappointment . i was very easy with it - it just stopped working ! buy a different camera - i wish i had
0	the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 ( and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body ) . i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1 . with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out . if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera ca n't fit in the bag at all . there 's also no padding to speak of with this case . by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure , padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again . targus makes decent laptop cases , but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently . apparently it does fit some cameras , just not the panasonic fzs . considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
1	excellent product.works as expected . like all lens hoods though pricey
0	do not buy the case canon sells for this camera . it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in
1	after reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the psc-55 , i was still undecided on a case for my canon sd630 . so , i purchased both to see for myself which one would work . because red is my favorite color , i really wanted the red case to fit ( psc-90 ) . the camera will fit in the case , but it 's a very tight fit . i had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close . the psc-55 is still a very snug fit , but allows for some extra breathing room which i feel is better for the safety of the camera . in addition , here 's something to consider if you 're deciding between the two cases : the inside lining of the psc-90 is more of a rigid nylon material , while the lining of the psc-55 is a softer felt material . the case overall is still rigid , but i like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining . based on that alone , i 'm going with the psc-55 - i feel that this will be more friendly to the 3 '' screen on the sd630 . both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive - i 'm pleased with the canon brand
0	for nearly $ 100 , this adaptor provides very little ( 1.5x ) magnification . it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly . this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor , which is used infrequently by me , but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance . it is lightweight , but cumbersome and does n't accept filters . for real telephoto capabilities , get an slr with interchangeable lenses . i sent this product back .
1	i am not a photographer , but i enjoy taking good pictures . i never had a digital slr before ; the camera i had before the d50 was a nikon coolpix ( a compact one ) . i thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro . i realized that it was even better than what i expected ( maybe because i was coming from a nikon coolpix ) . the colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good . the d50 is among the cheapest digital slr 's , and , at the same time , it is a very serious product . i do n't think the d50 is much inferior to the canon rebel , even if the canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution . i used both the d50 ( which i own ) and the rebel ( at my school ) and i think the d50 feels much more like a `` pro camera '' when you hold it in your hands , while the rebel feels more like a toy . the lenses provided in the package are good , but are basic . according to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80 , but i think i should have bought the 55-200 as well : 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take . also the 18-135 that nikon sells with the d80 looks good to me , but they do n't make a kit with those lenses for the d50 . the last thing that really amazes me is the .nef format ( nikon 's raw format ) . it is impressive how quickly you can improve a .nef picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse . if you want a good camera , and you do n't want to spend too much money for it i think this is the best choice
0	i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera . in the end , it came down to panasonic 's fx01 and cannon 's sd600 . i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic 's images were n't top quality , but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600 . i was wrong . after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera to be great , but it just was n't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera to amazon ( very easy-great service ) because of the poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs is why you take photos , right ? i know someone with the sd600 and he 's very happy with the quality . judging by the customer images on the sd600 's page on amazon , i think i should 've gone with cannon
1	love this battery . long lasting and just as good as the name brand
0	we ownded this for around 10 months but used it for just 5-7 hours . it stopped working all of the sudden ( no power ) sent it for warranty , ( part no labor ) . $ 160 labor fee just to know what was wrong with it . would not but another camcorder from panasonic ( they even wanted me to pay for having it sent back )
0	... unless they had n't insisted on the `` geared '' telescopic part . it has some sort of swivel that is supposed to raise and lower it , but the handle is the cheapest possible plastic and it broke the very first time i used it . it 's extremely annoying because overall it 's not a bad tripod , but it really did n't need that bit of `` hi-tech '' , and now i am unable to use the telescopic part at all ... yes , it 's lightweight and somewhat unstable , but i can live with that . the biggest problem is the bad engineering and the subpar materials ...
1	i purchased the axion 10.4 '' frame for my wife to replace a defective polaroid frame from a different source . the axion stacked up quite nicely to the other `` more expensive '' frame . the axion is viewable from more angles than the polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag . quality of the display is better on the axion and we have not had any technical issues . pros : brightness control color and contrast of display ease of setup and operation good sound from speakers on music playback cons : slide show transitions are from top to bottom only . different transitions would be a nice feature . remote does not control volume of music . overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages . we have been very happy overall with this purchase
0	these are my experiences with the extender mounted to my eos 10d . i 'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30d , but it looks like i do n't want to risk wasting my money . let me explain : let me start by saying that the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the lcd screen . i shoot events at nightclubs a lot , so i 'm always ( a ) running around to get shots , causing me to sweat , which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and ( b ) i always show the subjects their photos after i take them , so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying . for further clarification , i 'm asian , so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities . i run around a lot when i shoot . so the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off . i got lucky once , and found it in the general vicinity of where i was , but the second time , i was n't so lucky . so what did i do ? i purchased another one . not only did i have to purchase the extender , i had to purchase the viewfinder replacement ( the piece with the soft rubber ) because that was attached to the lost extender . another 2 weeks in , and again , same problem . i did n't even bother buying any replacements , as by this time , i upgraded to the 30d . if you do n't plan on doing a lot of running around , then this piece may be okay for you . however , please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my canon backpack . for some reason , the piece did n't fit tightly with the mount on the camera . another problem , as most people mentioned , is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender , so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day . i guess i 'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30d ; i 'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10d
1	this camcorder is the best i have ever had ! i have 5 others all higher and lower priced models for my business , i do video photography as one of my jobs . i love this camera , i dont know what would do without it ! my kids can even operate it , we have made so many quality movies at home . i also use this camcorder for paid wedding and special occasion videos , it works great and i love the brand i really perfer it to others . its not for you if you arent going to use alot or have a problem with the size , i dont think it 's that big but then again i use some equipment thats enormous . this is not a palm caamcorder . once you figure out if this is the camera for you , you will be please , i enjoy it a lot ! ! there are descriptions of the camcorder , options and quality of the product on this page . i love it and hope my short review helps . i know this is a non-detail review but all the info is on this page . this isnt for a person looking for a $ 400 dollar camera , if you want quality movies or use it for your job , ect . i really think this one is great ! hope this is useful , camcorder fanati
1	third camera from kodak easyshare . great performance and pics . slendor size
1	i 've seen this item for no less than $ 7.00 elsewhere , so i got a good deal .
1	i did a lot of research before buying this camera . we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price . what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm dvd-r , finalize the disc on the camcorder , and play it directly on our dvd player or dvd-rom player on our computer . we did n't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv , electrical outlet , and camera to playback footage . and we also did n't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future . for those of you who like to edit , re-record , create effects , etc. , you need to purchase special software separately , but with a dvd-ram disc , you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvd-rom on your computer . you can also download it with the usb cable , but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started . if you are only interested in playback , dvd-r discs are sufficient ; however , you ca n't erase or record over footage on dvd-rs , only dvd-rw and dvd-ram discs . the picture quality of the camera is adequate . it is n't grainy , but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting , especially outside on a sunny day . it does n't have a built-in light , so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording . i would give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5 . if you want better quality , you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder . considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology , it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy . you ca n't compare it to tv and movie camera quality , but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos . the zoom is good , but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly . the stabilizer is pretty good , but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality . if you plan to move around a lot , use the function , but expect to lose a little quality in the process . what basically happens when using the stabilizer ( with most cameras , i believe ) is that the image movements are slightly delayed . the sound quality is adequate , but if you are recording when it is windy , you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand . the only problem i have had so far is with the discs . we bought panasonic dvd-rw discs and ca n't get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player . we ended up purchasing sony dvd-r discs and they play with no problem . when i called panasonic about their dvd-rw discs , they did n't have a good answer . the representative told me to make sure the dvd-rw discs are compatible with my players . i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player , but it should be with my new computer software . the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there is n't any difference between sony and panasonic discs ( interesting ) . they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual , but now i know better . overall , this camcorder is a great value ( you ca n't beat the price for this dvd technology ) , average to good quality picture and functions , is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage , and is really easy to use .
1	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography . i bought the 17-85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in raw . i also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound . i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend . pay the extra $ $ $ and get this over the rebel xti . you wo n't be disappointed
0	the minute i took the monopod out of cover it broke . the mounting head fell apart from the leg . the glue they use is very bad . i did n't return the product because i think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords . i just fixed it myself
0	what a pile of junk . three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture . if you move at all during that three seconds , the picture is a blurred mess . even if you do n't move , the pictures turn out blurry and dark . and if you use the flash , you get a lovely white picture of nothing . i ca n't believe they sell this thing .
1	i gave this camera 5 stars because of it 's awesome features . this camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera . i love this camera . i think it takes awesome pictures
1	i highly recommend this super wide angle lens for anyone wanting to take landscape pictures , buildings or lots of other stuff ! it is so different than the standard kit lens ( 18-55 ) . you wo n't be sorry when you start learning all the possibilities of the extraordinary lens
0	i got this camera when it was rather new . i am not extremely pleased with it . it is not acting this way because it is 2 years old ... it was like this when i bought it . -first of all ... it has no lens cover so you have to keep it in a camera bag . incase you touch the lens without relizing ... all your pictures will be ruined . -it takes for ever to take a picture . you have to wait for like 2 seconds for the picture to be taken . -it eats up batteries like crazy -it takes forever to turn on -if you have the flash setting on autoflash , the camera will still flash in bright sunlight -the pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home -it has no optical zoom ( but the zoom is really the customer 's choice .
0	i have just bought the sony cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and i have only taken 30-40 pictures , i loved it and then it just stopped working , so i recharged the baterry , no luck still the camera would n't turn off or on . so thankfully i had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again . no it does n't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off . basically worthless . it seems like it might have short circuited . but i was so excitted to buy this camera i read all instructions before use , i have n't let anyone else use it and it has n't been out of my sight , never been dropped , never in extreme hot or cold , always well protected . so i am going to try to return it or exchange it . i am hoping to get good service or i will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures . hopefully i can let you know if they stand by their products . before now i have always been happy with what i have bought from amazo
1	this is a great bag . it fits the camera perfectly and has room for all of the accessories as well . i 'm very pleased and was happy that amazon carries the item as we could not locate it anywhere else
1	i bought this camera for my teenage son . the only problem we have found so far is that the battery life is too short . other than that , it is a good camera . the slim design is nice , and the camera is loaded with features
1	i 've purchased other bags but this one beats all it was a great price to
1	-this camara picture quality is nice , and depend on user purpose . my gf is kinda satify with it . -function is easy to use . -battery life is so so . -battery charger design is not convenience . you have the put the battery into the batter charger . recommand to get a cradle charger , but extra cost . it should sell with cradle charger .
0	nice look , good feel , turns on fast , takes great pictures . really great , with ridiculous depth of field and resolution , you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the lcd back , which is huge . so , what 's my beef ? slow pictures , double flash , slow slow follow on shot , slow . okay say cheese , one second , two seconds ... . i only got thiis camera because i thought that problem was solved . yes my battery is charged , no i do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all ... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye ? slow- i hate it ! ! ! ! ! ! still , its awsome , slick , and a fair price
0	i bought this frame in jan. '07 and the screen burned out march '07 . i returned it and the newest one burned out last night - april '07 . this product needs a redesign - the screens do n't work for long .
1	i have been using the fuji e550 for almnost two years , with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers . here are the negatives : 1 ) the flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky . if you do n't depress the shooting button all the way , it may not flash . 2 ) in bright light , the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image . but the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue . the positives : 1 ) it takes great pictures . really excellent . 2 ) it 's small , and easy to carry . 3 ) the controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body . very easy to use . 4 ) it has several automatic modes - sports , landscapes , portrait , etc , or you can use it on manual . i always use one of the programmed modes . 5 ) the video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old ( now 13 ) uses it . i was so pleased with this camera i bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago , and she is very happy with it . at it 's current price i think this camera is a bargain . only reason i did n't give it five stars is because of the weak flash .
0	i own many sony products , including a sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed by this camera , the sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present . it is small , lightweight , portable ; easy to use ; and stylish . it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months of use , a few problems have become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there is horrible red-eye ( and white-eye ) artifact in many pictures . the so-called `` red-eye reduction '' setting does nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography is very grainy , with lots of noise . night-time photography is impossible . these problems are not unique to our camera ... you will find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed in this camera , and wish i could exchange it for something else . do not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( and they are still small pocket-size cameras ) .
0	i thought i was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos i shot indoors i liked the analog better . very poor and grainy . also the focus is terrible ! while filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus . i filmed my daughter 's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing . very disappointed with this purchase . i guess it 's true what they say . `` you get what you pay for '' it seems under $ 600.00 does n't get you much
0	i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first . i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out . firstly , the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought . it still could have worked for my but for one thing : this bag is not designed for those with a , er ... ..womanly build . it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me . so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online . just a word of warning to the ladies ; -
1	i bought this a year ago and have taken many great pictures with it . it 's light , has many features and can be used as an automatic when all you want to do is point and click . i ca n't recommend it enough .
0	`` lens error , restart camera '' message appears today ( mar 26 ) after buying production on amazon on feb 20 , 07 . when i searched google for this error message saw thousands of canon users having similar error / e18 error with older and newer version of the canon . i have tried panasonic and sonys before and never had an issue . i dread that canon customer service is going to waste my hours in getting a replacement and ultimately may end up charging me over a 100 for repairs like they have done to other users ( after reading user feedback on web )
1	i am really satisfied with the purchase of this camera . good quality workmanship . canon has been a leader in photography in my book . easy to use controls for any one
1	this camera is really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when i ended up with a rebel xt as a `` loaner '' while my 20d was in repair . not that the xt is a bad camera , it just does n't really compare to the 20d . the 20d has a nice feel to it ; it is fairly large , which is great since i have somewhat large hands . the features are great too . and the image quality is awesome . i do n't really need to go into all of the details , as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job . let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars . the only complaint i have about the camera is that it does n't have spot metering . the ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d .
0	i got the dreaded `` e18 '' error after owning this ( naturally ) for just over a year . repairs will be at least $ 100 , and repairs are only guaranteed for 90 days ... even if the exact same problem occurs again ! this is clearly a design flaw ( just read how many users had the same problem ) . my first photoshot broke after about a year and a half , and since i liked the ease of use and basic design , i chalked it up to bad luck and bought another . big mistake
1	i really did some research on digital cameras , even tried out a sony , but the canon brand is by far one of the best . i do n't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera , it does most of the work ! i like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not iso , aperature , and all that jazz . the settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true . the digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry . there are so many features on this camera , too many to list . i even found a great deal at best buy on a 2 gig memory card , i get over 1,000 photos with a high resolution ! it takes alkaline batteries , but i bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time . i am sooo happy with this camera , i take it with me everywhere , even a couple of days to work .
1	i bought this item to be used with my sony hdr-hc3 camcorder in combination the fig rig . it works as advertised . i do wish the clamp portion of the item was removeable , but it can be worked around . i found the remote to be very responsive , as you would expect from sony . and the price was a bargin .
0	i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital . the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used . the delay between pictures is incredibly long . the lens/shutter does n't open properly . ( two other family members who own powershot a520 's are having the same problems
0	i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years . i love everything canon does . however i do not understand canon 's reasoning behind producing this lens . the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the `` film '' plane . they can not do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens . they have indicated , however , that by 35 mm that advantage is gone . why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses ? i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper ; but this lens is only $ 60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro . as i said , if for $ 60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach ( 66 in 1.6crop cameras ; useful in macro photography ) and that works on all canon cameras , i 'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all . granted , you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon , but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr 's , so why bother with this lens ? the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup , but the 60mm macro does n't make any sense to me . my $ 0.0
0	careful , this cable may work `` for most digital cameras , '' but it does not work with canon digital camera
0	nothing special and probably over-priced for what it is . the leather is nigh on invisible . it 's more of a skin to protect the camera from scratches , `` case '' would be stretching the definition somewhat
1	it is exactly the same thing as came with my camera- just what i neede
1	i bought this flash to use on a light pole with a flash trigger when we shoot weddings . rather than use one of my canon 580 's , i thought this was a better use of my $ $ -since i use this additional light in manual mode anyway . it does the job for under $ 10
0	i bought it for my 18-55 ef-s , and it looks like it is not very efficient - but i guess it is normal for a 18mm ( x 1.6 ) . i would have prefered a `` tulip '' design like those of sigma
0	i am a novice photographer , so take this with a grain of salt ... i just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components . i suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits , putting them together must seem self-explanatory . if you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating . it is also frustrating to discover smith victor does not have a support site ( just references on photography ) . they do not even provide a support # or address . keep all this in mind when considering something from this company
0	the 5x7 digital photo frame from pacific digital is very cheaply made , the lcd is very dark and flickers constantly .
1	yep , it extends the eyepiece out a little bit ... which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display ... but it also distorts the view in an annoying way . i use mine on occasion ... but not all the time
1	good camera for the $ 129 i paid . does everything pretty well , and your picture modes are pretty customizable . only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than i wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card . might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures -- but probably would n't be doing it with this type of camera anyways .
1	this is a good padded case for your camera . but the back pocket shown in the picture with a phone stick out , was not deep enough for my phone with antenna attached . it measure 4 '' x 3.5 '' . but other than that i enjoy using this bag
1	i always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with . this model helps you do both . you have a nice 5.1 mp still camera and mpegmovie4tv video . the very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge . i never had a video camera before because i hate to carry two camera and a big camera case , so this was the obvious solution . i realize that instead of embracing the moment ( for which they need the memory ) most people often juggle between cameras . cons : * sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone * buttons are harder to find * software is not the best * wish had more zoom pros : * convince * compact * battery lasts long * flash is good * video sound quality is good i wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing
1	after reading the reviews here and at [ ... ] on this baby , i was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance . let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded . yes , if you film in very low light , it will darken many colors . but we 're talking 60 lux , which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake . just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles , and viola ! seriously , i have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors , outdoors , or even when i film local bands playing in dark bars . the reason i wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews . i do not want a tape mechanism that will break , nor a fragile hard drive that can not be used in many film-worthy conditions ( think snow skiing , as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather ) . as i said , i was skeptical when i purchased it , but no more . the videos are far better than any other camcorder i 've owned . my last was a canon zr 50 mini dv , and this camera takes vastly superior videos than that one . the four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to . i have a mac , so editting requires that i convert to dv with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies . mainly , i just do n't edit my home videos so that has n't been a problem . but if would have been nice for it to be an easier option , and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3/aac , which appears to be the next standard . if that concerns you , or if you want hd , you might wait until the panasonic sd1 is available because it records in avhdc which is a form of mpeg4 . of course , imovie does n't yet support that either , so you may have to wait until ilife 07 to really use it . in parting , i will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous . i no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini dv camera . this thing literally fits in my jacket pocket , so i end up filming a lot more than i did with previous cameras . if you 're looking for small , flash-based , and good quality video , get this camera , you 'll love it
1	the charger really did what it was supposed to do . i have an li-10b , so i was still some what worried that it was n't going to do the job , but it did . i also liked that it was small so you can travel with it anywhere .
0	i bought this camera in february , and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died , i could review the photos i had taken , but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the lcd/efv , and only turned off when i removed batteries , i sent it to fuji repair center , and got it back again almost one month later . then six months later the camera did exactly same thing , i have n't received my camera back yet , but i 'm sure never will buy a fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after i get from the repair center and at the end of the day i will have wasted almost 500 dlls
1	i bought this flash to use on my canon rebel xt . the first thing i noticed was that without even reading the instructions i was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors . being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash . even when i set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down . it did not need anytime to recharge at all . i recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots . most of the pictures came back with great results . the only dissappointment i have is that when taking shots from further distance than i normally would , the pictures came back darker than i would 've liked . so , to compensate for this i adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right . another problem i have with the flash is the battery cover . it 's flimsy and i find it awkward to open and close at times . i always feel like i 'm gon na snap it off by accident . overall i am happy . it 's a good flash for the price you pay . the battery life is good . i still have n't even had to recharge the batteries and i 've almost taken 200 shots with it . my low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash . anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash . the difference is night and day
0	hp is selling this bag for $ 30 bucks , so when i found it here for $ 10 less i could n't let this `` deal '' pass me by ... however when i received the bag , i wished i had ... the color is less vibrant , it 's cheap , poor quality , plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag ... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead , it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !
0	i have gotten better results with sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price ... like less the $ 15 shipped
1	i spent alot of time evaluating this product . finally after reading the reviews i dug deep and spent the extra dollars to get this lense . it has been a wounderful addition to my canon reble . it is a very high quality product that is easy to use and delivers beautiful shot every time .
1	i needed this tripod to use with my 20x50 binoculars since the least movement with 20x magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field . this tripod works well for that use . it is sturdy , has lots of features and is reasonably priced . however , if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars , a right angle adapter will be needed . i found one on ebay for a few dollars .
0	my primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting , without the use of a flash . the camera could n't handle taking pictures without the flash at all , despite it being extremely bright in the room ( 5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights ) . the camera 's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that was n't blurry . maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear . i believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it . i used to have a cannon powershot sd450 that was awesome , but it was stolen and so i needed a replacement . i had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash , unlike the 900 . i am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose , this camera was horrible and it has since been returned . instead , i just got a fuji finepix f30 , which is supposed to be better without the flash . we 'll see
0	i purchased a 510 powershot in summer of 2005 . after couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens would n't work anymore . i cound't take any picture anymore . i contacted canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix .
1	very compact , light and easy to hold - full marks for design . buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to , but ok once mastered . main downside for me it only takes dvd-r/rw- and not dvd-r/rw+ , bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones ! also , can be a problem taking it abroad - i had issues charging it as it would take a standard us to uk converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal us plugs .
0	i 've had other digital cameras but this is the first one i 've had problems with . i started getting a zoom lens error shortly after i bought it but it would clear if i turned it off then back on . it is now unusable as the lens can not be retracted at all . it lasted 18 months
1	i needed an extra battery . this whole kit was cheaper than the price of the battery alone . in addition to the battery , you get a standard camera case ( retail $ 10-20 ) and a very nice shoulder bag intended to carry 2 cameras , accessories , and the portable canon printer . there is absolutely nothing not to like about this deal
1	the remote control works well with the olympus digital camera . it was delivered on time and without any problems .
0	not seeing many reviews , i 'm writing this as a warning . this mic is horrible . i bought it to get rid of the motor noise from my canon optura pi , as many others have . when i listen now , the sound is much worse . you can barely hear people speak over the loud humming ... this mic is horrible
0	this camera is a piece of junk . you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture . and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out . not to mention the battery life is horrible . i got a 1 gb memory card so i could take lots of pictures , but the battery runs out after i took about 10. so all in all , if you 're considering buying this thing , save the money and frustration and just do n't
0	received as a christmas present , dead by february 24 . well , actually , that 's two months . now all it does is flash an error message , and nothing i do gets it out of that mode . i liked it before it died on me
0	when i opened the package , i found the filter box seals ( one at each side ) were broken , an indication that it was not new . i thought it 's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear . when i opened the filter box , three pieces , the ring , the glass and the circular clamp , jumped out . while it 's bad sign , i still thought it 's ok as long as i could put them together . well , the glass was not clear , as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper ( i never saw any filter or lens in that shape before ! ) . before to ship it back , i did try to put three pieces togather ( so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box ) . guess what , the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends could n't meet ! ! ! i could n't image any scenario under which this could happen , since it was from amazon , not from some unknowns of ebay ( actually , any ebayer will have to worry about the feedback ) . i was really shocked that amazon shipped that garbage to its customer ! hope this is just a random incident and amazon does have a very easy return practice . otherwise , i would not buy anything from amazon
1	excellent camera kit . versatile . i have a lot to learn about the camera , though , as it is no simple point-and-shoot . however , in auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward to learning how to use it fully . lenses came with warranty cards , but the camera itself did not . i bought the sb-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 gb compact flash cards to round out the kit . camera with lens attached is large , which i underestimated . $ 80 camera bag is too small for it all . great camera , though . price was the best i could find anywhere
0	terrible product . printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly . i 've had a replacement sent and the same thing happens . even though i have printed less than 50 photos with this replacement , which i have had less than a year , kodak support says it can not be fixed by me and i need to have it serviced by them for 80 bucks . a new one sells for $ 99 and the price is dropping fast . i told kodak support i would not send it back to them , spending 80 dollars would be like flushing money down the toilet or taking a stick in the eye . i further notified kodak that i would instead send it to the place it belongs - a land fill . also , i 've heard that the recommended fix ( which does not work , by the way ) , unplugging the unit to reset , will cause the color cartridge light to illuminate prematurely . with the cost of paper and cartridges , this last insult makes this printer one to avoid . 1 star because when it does print the prints look good , but , man , the aggravation to get this thing to work correctly is not worth any price . rushed to the market place without enough reliability testing on an unsuspecting public . total junk from a venerable name desperate for a hit product .
1	it 's good as my title says , however , i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off
1	nick xu , if you ca n't figure out the difference between this lens , and the cheaper consumer grade lenses , by all means , stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses . after all , `` mr magoo '' of cartoon fame could n't tell a chevy from a rolls royce . all kidding aside , this lens is simply awesome in use . having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses . yes , it 's that good . i am using a borrowed version right now , but as soon as i pay off my new 24-105 f/4 l is usm lens ( very , very awesome ) , i will buy my own 70-200 f/2.8 is usm . it 's as good as it gets in this lens range , but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera , carry on , as it 's all about the end user . for everyone else , this lens is the holy grail of mid range telephoto lenses . it is simply the best available in it 's range , and responds well to canon tele adapters . if you can figure out a way to afford this lens , buy it , as it is all that . if you are a nikon lover buy this lens anyway , and buy a fairly cheap 20d body to make it work . it 's ok to tell your friends that you used a nikon to take the pics , but you will end up knowing that canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century . ( sorry , nikon fans , but this lens stands all by it 's self in the grand scheme of things . it 's simply awesome . )
0	i will keep this review simple . for the price this is an ok deal . however : the bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop . the battery charger is finicky and has below average build quality batteries are generic rechargeables . you are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger/batteries . it will wind up costing you less in the long run
1	wow ! ! ! this is my 4th sony , i keep trading up and i am so impressed . there is no delay on the shutter speed , great pictures and enough special effects to be fun , but not enough that you need a phd to operate
1	this thing is great i just got it for a trip to seattle from hawaii . ( i know opposite ) but i was afraid when i had this default battery that came with my canon zr 500 . ( which only last 45 min . ) but this one last at least 3 hours i love it . best buy for my camera so far , completely worth the $ $ $ $
1	i bought this camera just before a trip to ca and then a cruise ! it is very easy to operate ( even for a techno-retard like me ) and the pictures turned out great ! i have started to use the filming feature recently as my video recorder is with my son @ college and i want to film my daughter 's drill team performances ! i really like the fact that it does n't turn on while in my purse ! ! ! my old camera did that a couple of times , and i ended up with quite a few pictures of the contents of my purse - anyone want one ? ( lol ) all in all , a great buy ! 8 months later and the lcd display is gone ! literally , gone ! do n't know what happened - took pictures/movies of daughter 's drill team performance , and when i got it out again to take pictures before sadie hawkins , it would still take pictures ( i just downloaded them ) but since the display looks like `` a piece of plaid fabric with a marijuana leaf coming in from the right side '' i do n't know what i 'm taking a picture of ! need to replace soon ! i 'm ( now ) bummed
0	i purchased this camera right before we had our first child . needless to say , i would have rather donated the money to charity ! the flash recovery time is ridiculously slow , but that i can live with . the 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry , i can not . now i have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on . needless to say i think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera
0	i wish there was a space for zero stars . we bought this frame for my in-laws for christmas and it worked for ten minutes and then died . it was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here , others have had a problem with it freezing . once it does that , there 's no fixing it , apparently . do some research and buy another unit ; that 's what i 'm going to do
0	i owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me , and i said `` thank you ! '' because i hated the thing . i used to have a 4mp samsung and it was better than this one . the worst problem : slow . slow slow slow . if you use the flash , be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture . it 's worse at low battery strength , but even with fresh batteries it was tedious . the other thing that disappointed me was the color . the light from the flash is glaring and unnatural , and without the flash everything is reddish , grainy , and blurry . i never found a decent middle ground . i take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light , and my samsung was n't great but it was better than this one . when i look at the pictures i 've uploaded on my computer , i can see the difference when my old camera died and i got the nikon . the worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else 's camera and wishing i owned that one . do some research before you make a mistake like i did . i 've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera
0	this camera looks cool . but it 's so , so not cool . the people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves . this is by far one of the worst products i have ever purchased . ever . by the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place . it `` clips '' on ... but not for long . the camera 's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow . it 's complelety unreadable . even with a 150mb card i could only take a few short quality videos . you can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings . and i 'm talkin ' low quality . worse than any video you 've seen online . more problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it . the controls and interface are not intuitive . you 'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep . oh , and the earbuds that come with the camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk are huuuuge . they are n't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short . i had the camera in my pocket and when i stood erect , the earphones were violently yanked from my ears . they 're obviously intended for oompa-loompas . i 'm sure i could have found more problems with this thing , but it eventually died on me for no reason . do n't waste your time with this . you will be sorely disappointed . in fact , if i could give this product a rating of-10 stars i would do so . i 'm so extremely disappointed with this camera
0	just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted . never used . returned it
1	i 'm new to the digital slr world . i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt . the built-in flash had done alright , but was nothing to write home about . since i had spent most of my money on the camera , i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done . this flash met both requirements . if you are an advance user , you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features . yet , if you a newbie like me , this flash is great ! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly .
1	the product was easy to use and accurate . it is also a great buy
1	i purchased a nikon l5 from costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on saturday after i saw the lz-7 . the lz-7 is way better in all aspects than the nikon l5 , save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode . pros : takes great pictures ; optical image stabilization ; 6x zoom ; and , great price . it is also made in japan , not china as the nikon l5 is . cons : fixed zoom while in movie mode ; no on-board camera speakers
1	your site was the only place where could find a replacement for my lost nikon uc-e6 usb cable for my nikon coolpix 3100 . even nikon could not satisfy my request . thank you cynthia valesi
1	this lens is outstanding . speed and sharpness are top-notch . i use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results . best lens in it 's class at a reasonable price . it 's well built , sturdy , and not so heavy so it 's relatively easy to carry around . canon really impressed me with this lens . i use it with my eos system ( traditional and digital cameras ) .
0	this keychain photo viewer sold by a company called `` smartparts '' is identical to one sold by `` argus . '' neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support . you buy this , you 're on your own . you seem to be able to find the argus one a little cheaper ... though they do mar the front of it with a big , black imprint of their logo . in any case , this thing is maybe worth $ 20 as a novelty . do n't pay more . image quality is mediocre and the software , while functional , is stunningly primitive . if you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations , it 's a kind of cute gizmo . but do n't give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy . check the bargain bins for this thing , or just wait for the next generation device . -- m
0	i ordered two of the items above in error . i did not think the first order was submitted properly so therefore a second one was ordered and came from antonline . i have been trying since dec. 19 to return the wide angle lens and adapter to them . i am 71 years old and not computer savvy . i just wish i could get return labels and my account credited . they are still in the original packing as received and never been opened . thank you for being interested . i was informed by them that my time had expired . i do not believe this to be true , or does your opening web page not apply to them .
0	well . i was convinced the fx07 was a bad product after using it for 6 months . like a lot of other reviews have pointed out , the noise level in low-light condition is annoying , and give you a watercolor-like effect . some pictures i took during a visit to monterey bay aquarium turned out completely dark ( to prevent this beforehand , i even took photos of the same objects using several different settings , only to get the results of bad , worse , and worst ) . the picture quality is nowhere close to my old old old sony cybershot t7 . i was totally disappointed . if not for my t7 was broken , i would n't even wan na use this camera . even re-sell it to other people , i would feel it 's like a crime . after revisiting this webpage and read more user reviews , i realized i must have got the defective item from amazon . well . what can i say ? it 's been 6 months . bottom line : just be careful when you received this item . do some test shots . if anything looks suspicious , ask for a replacement . after all , all the high praise here ca n't be all wrong
1	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography . i bought the 17-85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in raw . i also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound . i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend . pay the extra $ $ $ and get this over the rebel xti . you wo n't be disappointed
1	i received my 28-200 yesterday from amazon . having read the customer reviews , i immediately put my rebel xt on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my canon 28-135 is . three shots each at f-stops 5.6 , 11 , and 20 , one set indoors at iso 1600 and the other outdoors at iso 200 . focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera , highest jpeg setting . after shooting both series , i compared them fresh out of the camera , side by side . results : the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances . it was visibly sharper at iso 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20 , ( the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10 ) , and at 20 , it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background . the 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise . both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in photoshop . there are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider ; different test scenes conceivably produce different results . my conservative conclusion : the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your canon ( unless you are going to drop $ 2200 on the l series 28-300 is and carry it ) , and the 28-135 is has no clear sharpness advantage . between these lenses , its a tradeoff -- -an extra 65 mm of focal length ( 105 mm after a 1.6 conversion ) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability . both lenses focus quickly and silently , and both lenses produce usable shots .
1	the case is protective and stylish without hindering the camera 's ability to store and transport easily . it 's definately worth the dough to keep your nikon s1 or s2 from scratching or even breaking from a minor fall
1	for the price and quality i rated this lenses with 5 stars . if you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos i took in europe . i too around 5000 photos . i posted a few on the web ( see link below ) . for the price i recommend this lens as walk around lens . the zoom is pretty usefull they are very realiable and ( almost ) very sharp . get this lens instead of the kit lens ( 18-55 mm ) until you are ready to spend more . here are some of my pictures taken in europe with this lens ( images have been compressed ) : http : //www.laplazita.net/europa/
0	i 'm a diehard nikon fan . my first nikon was a gift from my father when i was 13 . since then , photography has been a serious hobby , having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college . having said that , and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera , i absolutely agree with them . someone responded by saying those reviewers have n't read the manual . baloney . i bought the coolpix l1 to replace a 4 year old coolpix 850 . the l1 's camera 's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors , especially with the macro settings . i 've been patient and have given it three months . i am fed up . this camera is going back to amazon in the morning
1	the leather is very soft and the case is simply quality . i should have bought this one the first time
1	this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well . the build is solid ( metal construction ) . the glass is also descent quality . about the performance , it absorbs some uv light . the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable , probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me . now , about the one problem which is the internal reflection . i 've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation . the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure ( the surrounding environment ) . to put it in example ( which hopefully is easier to understand ) , when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection . as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture ( and not in the center of the picture ) , the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear ( if you move the light far enough from the center ) . and if the light is n't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection . but of course most of the time , a lamp at nightime is often very bright . but the point that i 'm trying to make is that the internal reflection does n't happen all the time during low light or night time . additionally , the internal reflection is n't only happening at night . it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example . basically same rule as above , on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area , and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear ( also depending the angle ) . but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation ( which is not hard to do ) . i 'm actually not a fan of lens filter ( any filter ) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object , but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens . and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you do n't have any filter for your lens yet . i use this filter on my 50mm f/1.8d lens and on my 18-55mm lens .
1	while not on the 'highest end ' of tripod purchases , this one is a must for anyone owning a hdr-hc1 or other compatable camcorder . operating the camera from the tripod ( rather than the touch screen ) provides steady footage for the amatuer videographer . the unit assembles easily and has stable panning and rotation . the only drawback is the soft storage bag which does n't provide adequate head protection
1	bought as a gift for daughter in law . she loves it . seems to be an excellant entry level camcorder . enough bells and whistles to satisfy most without being excessively expensive . quality is good which is to be expected from jvc . operation is simple enough and picture quality even for jpeg internet quality stills is satisfactory .
0	the thing is that it is not a very stable camera , hence it does not give you very stable shots , so many of your pics will be blured . even those taken with a tripod . i am a pro photographer , and i would not recommend this camera . yes , it 's very thin , but is not worth the pics it takes ... seek for other model not so tiny if you 're expecting better images
1	i am certainly happy i bought this filter kit . for a starting photographer , the price was right , and i have not noticed any quality issues . the uv filter stays on a lens at all times , as it 's cheaper to replace the filter , than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired . the light polarizer is very handy , and also works very well , cutting down greatly on glare . i have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet . the filter case is a nice extra , it fits right in my camera bag , and is out of the way untill i need it
1	this thing is perfect for carrying your stuff around in a not-so-fattening way . i hvae an external flash , macro kit , 28-80 lens , 50mm lens , 18-55mm lens , dslr w/batt grip and 75-300mm lens attached all fit into the main body of this thing . everything is seperated by the dividers making me feel confident and safe while walking , hiking , biking , etc . the addon pouches seem to make it a bit more bulking that you 'd want , but the bag all by itself is fantastic and i ca n't recommend it enough - get away from huge bulky shoulder bags ! ! lowepro did it again
1	this is a wonderful bag for the photographer that wants a light weight bag that can still hold a lot of lenses or bodies . the bag slings around to the front allowing the user to easily switch out lenses without having to unload the entire bag or worry about dropping an expensive lense . also , the bag can hold a lot of accessories . i had to canon rebel xt bodies and 3 lenses in just the camera compartment . the flap that opens up to the user when the bag is on your chest has the memory card holder , but it hold 8 memory cards which is huge ! the top has a small pouch where you can tuck away larger objects like a water bottle or map . the all weather bag cover is built into the bag so you do not have to worry about folding it up and storing it . the bag cover also has velcro pulls that latches it onto the bag so that it stays on insuring a dry environment inside the bag . basically this is a top notch bag that can get through anything . yes , i have actually used the bag on a few trips and find it very user friendy and reasonable
1	i bought a canon powershot a70 . they say your best camera is the one you use most , and man i use it . i 'm a high schooler , so i dont have much money , but with the a70 , i can attach this adapter ( la-dc52c ) to my camera , and i can have more photographic freedom with lenses , for alot less money . you have to have this adapter first . then any lense which fits ( most ) , can be used ... good idea canon ! ! !
0	i 've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but i am not having the same experience . the quality of the photos are horrible so i started thinking it was me and i tried it with different settings , tried being very , very still etc but , i only get one good shot out of about ten . i have a fuji 4mp that i bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this . i bought this so i could give my old one to my daughter but i 'm gon na end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my fuji . we recently had snow here in tucson so i took pictures with mu fuji and compares them to the canon and the 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down . i do n't get it , did i get a defective camera or am i doing something wrong or does this camera just suck
1	fall through spring i always carry my r817 in coat pocket when i go out . this jacket fits my camera like a glove . allows access to all controls and lcd display through clear , heavy duty plastic film , once flap is opened . open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera . only time i zip open jacket is to remove memory chip or change battery , otherwise , i just leave jacket on camera at all times .
1	this is a great buy if you are just wanting to have some fun , with no real investment . although it does go beyond 17 feet , and that is not as far as you may think . but , i used it while snorkeling and the pictures turned out great , and i am sure a few were more than 17 feet .
0	i purchased this case for my dscs90 . i hate it ! it is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else . there is no handle to the case , in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle . the zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so i do n't recommend doing this . look for a better case for your new camera .
1	the np-bg1 type g lith pack had good picture life , but i 'd carry a spare if your going to use your cameras movie feature
1	awesome , compact camera that takes remarkably sharp pics- very easy to use touchscreen and ( my favorite ) reliable stabilization feature
0	this camera took some great pictures , and i enjoyed it 's size and functionality for several months . i was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when i was passing it to a friend who was also seated . the camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass . the end . the lens assembly is shot , according to my local camera store , not economical to fix . this was about the softest fall a camera could take , and not work , it was like landing on a pillow . i will not buy hp cameras again
1	i purchase this lens for the digital rebel xt body i also purchased through amazon . so far the lens has performed as expected . it is solid and well built . sticks slightly , when zooming through 200mm . images are crisp and focus is sharp . working at 300mm can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod . shooting a bird in flight at 300mm is a trick . overall , good lens for $ 200 . if you have more money , then a lens with image stabilization ( is ) would be the way to go .
1	i do weddings , portrait , and outdoor photography and i do n't see any reason why i 'd ever switch from the d70 ( other than the d80 : ) . this camera is professional grade at the consumer price point . do n't be scared by the 6.1 mp . i print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems . i 'd recommend reading thom hogans manual
1	i love this rangefinder- much better than the type that shoots the prism on the flag sticks . you can use this one to find yardage to bunkers , creeks , etc . very accurate and very useful . well worth the money
0	in my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily . it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise . this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable . my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended . i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate
0	bought the charger and an extra battery . when my camera battery started getting low i tried to charge the batteries and the device just sat there trying to charge but never charged the batteries . competely useless . have to go buy a different charger
0	i made mistake getting such a big bulky case for small minidv sony camcorder hc26 . this case can take any big size old camcorders ( like old sony hi8 ) , so if you are looking for your new camcorder this definately is a bad choice
0	i found it on sale- luckily because it did not work . cute as the dickens and came with a great strap and the art program was fun for the kids- but no go on the camera . never able to get it to power up- yes fresh batteries too . we were very disappointed :
1	it was everything it advertised as being . i can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras . being a slingshot backpack , my back does n't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags . i like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack
1	thank you for showing me , i will use it as many times when it comes into my mailbox soon
0	not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on . i would turn it off and on and nothing would help . finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in . this seemed to fix the problem a few times . after that i thought it was just operator error . but it was n't . the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away . so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile . an event came up about a month later . i got my camera and tried to turn it on . nothing happened . so i changed the batteries . still nothing happened . i 'm not sure what happened . i do believe i purchased a lemon camera . i 'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung . it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time . so i guess you get what you pay for !
1	so far , i really love this camera . it 's very user friendly and gives you the option to put it in a very basic mode or normal mode . what attracted me to purchasing this camera was because of the long battery life and because of the picture quality . it has a large viewing area which is nice and it 's very clear . i recommend this camera
1	i recently purchased this for use with my 550ex . if you use alot of flash for event photography , you will want this in your kit . it is expensive , but i think it is worth every penny . it will keep you from changing aas in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant . you can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure . you can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt . mounting on my 20d was just not comfortable . it gets in the way of the hand-grip
0	i 've owned this camera a little over a year . it was my 2nd digital camera . it always had focus issues in low-light . i thought it was me , but after working extensively with the manual , after i finally had some time , i discovered that it was the camera . you really need a tripod for those low-light shots . i was n't able to return it , so i 've taken hundreds of pictures with it . it takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen . however , the lens will no longer contract and i get an error message that is unresolvable unless i pay at least $ 170 . i 'm just going to get a better quality camera . i will not buy sony again
1	the camcorder compact power adapter worked very well . i was given great help in finding the right one for my canon camcorder , which in itself was amazing . 5 stars to the product and to the helpers who helped me locate the right one
1	first thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying . the kit lens comes with canon 20d , 30d , 300d , or xt is the lower version , non usm one . on the higher version usm ones , you will see the red color `` usm '' at the front of the lens . according to the reviews , compare with the non usm ones , optically they are the same . however , the usm motor does focus faster and much quieter . people complain about the build quality . actually i feel that it is really not that bad , much better than the canon 50mm f1.8 ii . the usm auto focus performance is fast , never hunt , and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 ii . it fits nicely on the xt . do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more . we have to compare apple to apple . if you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely , the images will come out nicely . 1 . this is not the lens for indoors low light conditions . if you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed , go get a different lens . ( for example , i use a canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation . ) 2 . the distortion on 18mm is quite a bit . avoid taking strait lines ( like buildings ) pictures on the edge while wide open . however , this can be easily corrected on computers . 3 . step down the aperture to f8 or f11 , the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners . overall , the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens . it is very light weight and highly portable while traveling . this fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens .
0	i have owned several canon digital cameras and like them very much . i purchased the a520 as a gift for a family member . after several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening . it would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open . the key word being stick or stuck . i took it to a canon service center and they repaired it under warranty . after trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge . i took it back to the service center and they repaired it again . while looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty . it was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time . after emailing canon they said to just email them if i have a problem and they would see what they could do . very poor . i like canon digital cameras but wish i had never purchased the a520 . i bought it because of it 's low price , which was a big mistake
0	`` you get what you pay for '' most of the time that cliche is true , but there are products out there that break this rule . the philips dvp642 is one of them , a great quality , versatile product selling at a bargain price . this is not . i was hoping the same of this product from all the `` glowing '' reviews on here . however , this quality of this monopod is very disappointing . first of all , you have to ask yourself , why do you need a monopod over a tripod ? for myself and most , it 's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses . however , telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task . this monopod does n't even come close . here are it 's bad points : -the aluminum construction is very cheap quality . the leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them . it feels like thin , cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time . -the head is very cheap and not solid . no matter how tight i tightened the head , my camera would slope down . the workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point , you think that you 're going to break the plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much . i think we 've all experienced that in the past . -the leg locks are not tight . when you push down on the monopod , the leg segments slide back into themselves . in the end , it was a risk i took hoping that i could get a high-quality product for a cheap price . sometimes , you can get away with that . walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $ 30 . in this case , i should 've bought a real monopod . oh well , i wasted $ 16 that i could 've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod
1	for the price , you get a lot out of this camera . 6x zoom stabilized , the images comes out great at full zoom ( 2 stabilization mode ) . the aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture . the multiple program modes , just about lets you take a great picture under different situation ! controls are easy to use and get to . in all definitely a great buy for the price . the down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the dmc-lz5 or a camcorder .
1	okay , first off , i 'd like to say that this is my first af slr -- i stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera , canon ae-1 manual focus , and right now i am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing . i 'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this , i am having fun ! it amazes me that canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price . i just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing -- so clear and the colors are very vibrant . just to let you know , i 'm using the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 usm lens . i took the suggestions of many and passed up on the `` kit '' lens and i 'm sure glad i did so . i would highly recommend the f/3.5-4.5 lens , but unfortunately for the rest of you , amazon has discontinued it . but you could order it from one of the many other photo shops ( b , adorama , etc ) . do i have any regrets on this purchase ? absolutely not ! i love this camera and even though i 've owned it for less than a month , i 'm actually thinking about stepping up to the eos 3 and using this as a backpacking/hiking body . hmm ... what to do , what to do ? do i purchase another body or start a collection of l-series glass ? ... that is the question .
0	this battery only gives me about an hour of playing time on my philips pet724 7 '' portable dvd/divx player . after that it claims to have 75 % charge left but ca n't even get the player to turn on and does n't charge it if it 's turned off
1	this battery recharger does its job well . no bells or whistles , just plug it in , put the battery in , and wait for the red light to turn green
1	i did a lot of research before buying the pv-gs250 . now that i have the camera in my hands i know i made a great choice . great image quality . great build quality . the low light problems you read about are not really a big deal . in a noramlly lit room everything is fine .
1	i purchased this camera as a replacement for canon optura 20 which was dropped and when estimate for repair exceeded price of this camera , i decided to move on . after using dcr-hc28 for several weeks , i believe this is a very neat package . overall , i am very satisfied with this camera . one of the first things that i noticed is that color representation in low light conditions is much more accurate than that of canon . i grew accustomed to adjusting optura 's white balance indoor in order to get accurate color tones . now i am finding , that automatic settings work just fine and , in fact , i did n't have a reason to play with presets as of yet . this camera is more of a `` point and shoot '' type than canon . it provides you with manual controls , but they are not easily accessible . still , i have not found a reason to mess with these . besides , for those , who would claim that manual settings are necessary for advanced/professional type of filming , i would point to the price tag and ask where and when did they last see an advanced/professional camera for under $ 300 ? this camera is also about half the size of canon and combined with low price and weight , produces a package that i can drag with me while going to the beach , bicycling , hiking , etc and not having to worry about ruining expensive piece of electronic gear , as was the case with my optura which , at the time when i bought it , cost me about 2.5 times of what i paid for sony . so far , i 've used this camera in about all of the lighting conditions that i would expect to ever having to consider . i have no complaints about its performance . picture seems to be sharply focused and color tones are correct . focus is fast enough to keep up with little kids or to shoot some sports/action . sound quality of the microphone is quiet acceptable . there seems to be very little noise from drive motor and it is not picked up by the mic so it is not transferred to your recording . all of the essential controls and menus are within easy reach . there are few negative points that prevent me from giving this camera 5-star rating . lack of any kind of accessory shoe or external microphone input is a drawback . it would be nice to have these , as it would increase range of conditions under which one can use it . still , among my friends , who actually have a camcorder , about 90 % do n't own an accessory light or external microphone , so if it was possible to lower camera cost by omitting these features , it is not a criminal move on part of sony . the lcd display could have been a bit larger and it would not hurt if sony would provide it with more freedom of motion - it only swings out to 90 degree angle and in certain situations it is a limiting factor .
1	got the lowero slingshot 100 about 2 months ago , and it is really coming in handy . in the main area , it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted , 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens ( 80-320mm ) , plus a sigma ef-500 super flash . it 's packed in there , and the flash just barely fits , but i do n't need much more room . the top compartment holds extra batteries , recharger , etc . really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back ... just by pulling the case to my front ( no need to take it off my back ) . well made . zippers are strong so i do n't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out . perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer .
1	other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping , the battery itself in a good deal . they work well , charge up easy and hold their charge nicely . priced well , they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony . i bought them for a d80 and the older en-el3a would not fit . of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they did n't fit the d80 . basically the same size and shape , but keyed differently . i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s , meaning they are backward compatable .
1	i bought a spare battery for my d70s and charged it up one time . since then , i have been waiting to use my spare but the original ( charged hundreds of pictures ago ) has been going strong for , literally , months . follow the directions . do n't use it until your fully charge and do n't recharge until it 's run down . this will help maintain battery life . good product from a great company
0	we have not received this item yet . please let me know the current status
1	i started with a d50 and have loved it from the very begining . i felt ready to step up to the next level , but did n't think i was ready for the d200 . when i heard about the d80 , i read everything i could . the biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body . i do n't use all of the mode setting and find myself in shutter and aperture priority most of the time , but it 's nice to have the others there when i do n't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings . the in camera image enhancements are amazing -- but a word of caution . vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots -- if not too much so . i 've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years . compared to the canon 30d ( which i was thinking about ) or even the new 400d ( i have n't actually held one yet ) , this is the nikon to have . on batter life , i had a recent shoot where i took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period . the battery was at about half and that 's with quite a bit of lcd viewing . at this level both canon and nikon offer great equipment -- you ca n't go wrong with either . just get one of each in your hands , snap a few shots , and go with the one that feels the best for you
1	this monopod does a great job for my camera . you have the quick , easy-off , it attatches to your camera by a screw , and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly . i wanted a nice , inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense . i have a canon 35mm , and i recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it , and i needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot . if i knew then what i know now , i would buy it again . nice product
0	when i opened the package , i found the filter box seals ( one at each side ) were broken , an indication that it was not new . i thought it 's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear . when i opened the filter box , three pieces , the ring , the glass and the circular clamp , jumped out . while it 's bad sign , i still thought it 's ok as long as i could put them together . well , the glass was not clear , as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper ( i never saw any filter or lens in that shape before ! ) . before to ship it back , i did try to put three pieces togather ( so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box ) . guess what , the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends could n't meet ! ! ! i could n't image any scenario under which this could happen , since it was from amazon , not from some unknowns of ebay ( actually , any ebayer will have to worry about the feedback ) . i was really shocked that amazon shipped that garbage to its customer ! hope this is just a random incident and amazon does have a very easy return practice . otherwise , i would not buy anything from amazon
0	i got it on sale for $ 88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price . i feel i was ripped off . the video quality is ghastly when given enough light , and absolutely unusable without . the same goes for the pictures . even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements , the results are mediocre . the audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum , which i was able to remove with my audio editing software . otherwise , the audio recording and playback were `` acceptable , '' at best . this device is useful only as an audio recorder/mp3 player , and is not really a bargain
1	this kit is a must have for any of the compatible canon cameras . digital camera rule # 1 : always carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for that alone . the leather case is great : stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera . the neck strap is quite strong and looks good too . it may not be everyone 's cup of tea but i like it . it comes in handy when i need quick access to the camera and do n't want to fumble through pockets or bags
1	it gave me the option to change the angle of the light ... this is a nice option to have i am sure
0	i would love to really rate this camera case but i have not received it yet . we have been waiting for almost two months and still no case
1	this , in my very humble opinion , is the most useful , the sharpest , and just about anything else good you can think of say , best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody , anytime , anywhere . lightning fast and that 's what you want when the light is low . my gal pal sara and i have often wandered the caribbean islands in the dawn 's early light , as she is into shooting old homes . she particularly likes the gingerbread homes in marigot , on the french side of st. martin . i swear she must have them all on her hard drive . it 's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion , feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light . she just loves it and since i love her , i got ta love it too . seriously though , i 've used the lense quite a bit myself and it 's a keeper if ever there was one . you just go wrong with a canon `` l '' lense , no siree . jack priest , sailor home from the se
0	the scd6550 is a great idea , but just does n't preform as i had hoped . i was looking for one camera to take on vacation , replacing carrying a 2 year old sony minidv and a 5 mp sony cybershot . my sony takes 1 mp stills , has excellent video , but @ 1mp , the stills are not nearly print worthy . this camera is actually smaller and lighter than my sony . the 5mp still camera function gave excellent results , both with flash and with natural light and outside . shot for shot it produced either as good or better prints ( 4x6 ) than the sony cybershot . digital video is this unit 's short coming . i did identical shots inside and outside with the sony and samsung . the samsung 's video quality was very poor , looked more like analog or standard 8mm quality . inside , with natural room lighting , it was pretty much unacceptable . outside , the shots lacked the crispiness of the sony . i took it back , will keep the sony 's and hope that sony comes out with a greater than 2 or 3 mp model soon
1	i use it with my nikon d70 , and am very satisfied with it . i most often use it for long exposures , for taking picture that include myself , and for taking pictures of my 6-month old daughter , who stops acting naturally when she notices i hold the camera , so i place it on the tripod , and take pictures of her .
1	i have been using this scope on the beach at night to monitor sea turtle nesting . when up close , the image is excellent , but not so good for far away ( more than 100-200 ft ) . very easy to use , and the fact that it 's waterproof is a plus ( have n't dropped it in the ocean yet ! ) . you ca n't really get a feel for how good the image is in a residential area , but out on the beach , with the moonlight , it rocks . most of the time i do n't even need the ir illuminator . to save power , turn it off , and it will still provide an image with the available light for almost 5 minutes . if you 're looking to see things that are far away , this scope wo n't work well , but for things that are close by ( say , from one end of the backyard to the other ) it 's a good deal . i put mine in a hard sided padded carrying case , since it gets bounced around on the atv , and have n't had a problem yet
1	go to nikon 's own website nikonusa.com and compare the technical specifications of this version and the 'g ' version of this lens . there are only three differences . one is that the 'g ' version has its aperture set only by the camera body , while the 'd ' version can have its aperture set either by the body or by a ring on the lens . all recent nikon bodies set the aperture . the ring on the lens is invariably locked on all recent camera bodies . the second difference is that one ( 1 ) of the 13 lens elements in the d version of the lens is made of extra low dispersion ( ed ) glass . if the dispersion difference is so important what is the deal with the other 12 elements ? sounds like marketing to me . the third difference is that the 'd ' version costs three times as much as the 'g ' version
0	do n't buy this camera really . i had it for a month and was taking good care of it . i was initially thrilled . the lcd screen got damaged -- no i did n't drop it . the treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that i was shocked . the customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if i were an idiot . a $ 181 repair bill for a $ 300 camera is not feasible . it was a great camera at first , but i demand better treatment and respect from the company . look for a better camera , look on the web for comments on their customer service and do n't buy this camera . i had read very negative things about sony but did n't think they applied -- they really are true . i do n't like being called a liar by anyone especially when i am the customer . the camera is a month old and it is now garbage . while i understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty , i will not accept such poor treatment and customer service . i teach photography and will tell my students the same thing -- if customer service and respect matter to you , then do not buy this camera .

0	i bought a 743 for the wife for christmas . i had a 6330 that i was very happy with . so a 743 should be better right ? every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead . we finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on ! after several e mails they told me to call service . i got someone in india that could not understand me and i had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying . they made it very dificult to get it sent in . i sent it in today , but i do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far . i hope it comes back at least .
0	i purchased this for my daughter since i had already had purchased one for myself . the pictures are clear and crisp . if i had to buy another i would purchase the same
0	i bought this camera a year ago , the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light , but for using indoor ( with flash ) is very , very bad . when you use flash the photo are not good , but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice , if you can bought another camera .
0	i had this camera for 2 months . it was kept in a case and was very well taken care of . i would not even allow my husband to touch it . i was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen . i took another and the same thing . i asked my husband what he thought was wrong . we took out our memory card and tried internal . same thing again . he said maybe it was the lcd screen . we loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse . i contacted kodak several times . they do n't care about their customers . i have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results . we will try to get their attention with a lawsuit . if interested contact me [ ...
1	when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i 'd always be loyal to film . digital could never take the place of film . i 'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely . there 's still something i love about putting a roll of film in the camera , shooting away , sending the film to be processed , and seeing the results . i also know it 's a bit expensive . i know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion , but digital cameras are improving in this regard , and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving , we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital slr and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera . so i figured now is the time to get a digital slr . i have been a loyal nikon user for nearly ten years , and have owned the nikon n60 , n70 , and n80 . my first love was , and still is the n70 ( i 've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought i was the only person who loved the n70 ) . i purchased the n80 only after my n70 cost too much to repair , but i 've enjoyed the way my various nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if i do n't have the time to use specific controls , but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes . my nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes , wildlife shots and all sorts of other things i ca n't resist to capture forever . i decided to purchase the d70 since it was close to what i 've already experienced with nikon . in many ways it works in a similar way to the n70 and 80 , except it 's a digital rather than film version . like the film versions of the midrange nikon slr 's , it has a dial that allows an automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , and night portrait modes , the ability to select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . the camera has auto and manual focus abilities . photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires . the controls are easy to use , though it takes practice to be comfortable . on a personal level , the camera has passed the halloween test , niece 's birthday test , and fall foliage in new england test and favorite scenic spots test . the only real difficulty i 've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting . auto focus has not worked at all and i 'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots , but at this point i 'm sure it 's the photographer and not the camera . i do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera . the manual is very confusing . it uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else . i 've had luck with the `` magic lantern guides '' with my other cameras , but have not as of yet used it for this camera . i did purchase the nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which has been helpful . it can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography .
1	i was n't sure if it would be worth spending the money on this case . how wrong i was . if you 're into diving and have one of these cameras , buy it now
1	yep , we love this camera ! amazon got it to us just in time for our trip to las vegas and we got wonderful footage and great still shots of our trip . the still shots are amazing , you can really zoom in close and get great clear shots of things our regular digital camera could n't . in fact we tested this and have proof , as we had both cameras with us . my son got a great close up of star jones from far across the gathered crowd , right up to her face as if he were standing right in front of her , and my photo from the same area is so pixilated and blurry you ca n't even tell what the subject was ! i love that we have two cameras in one , video and stills , so we do n't have to carry both . i really like that there is a separate card for the still photos so low battery power does n't threaten to wipe the memory clean . we eventually got a longer life battery but the one hour did just fine on our trip . it would be nice to have a separate battery charger , but it really did n't get inconvenient , we 'd just plug it in while we slept and we were ready for the day when we woke up . and the price was excellent for all the features we got . yep , we love this camera
0	last year , i purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my nikon 2100 . i am extremely upset over this purchase i have made , since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures . the nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside . the indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint , and does not focus well . however , the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp . i tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures . the outdoor video works well on this camera too . i am giving this low one-star rating , since many events tend to be held indoors . this was definitely my final nikon purchase ever
0	the cybershot dscs40 was bought as a christmas gift for my daughter in 2005 . a few days after christmas 2006 , the camera ceased functioning . because the camera was shipped in november 2005 , sony refused to honor the one year warrantee and the repair price was given as $ 111 . needless to say , we will not be purchasing another sony product in the future
1	i have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy . it has both point and shoot , and slr features . you can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography . the software was easy to use , easy to set up , and it works well on my mac . it has the quality the you would expect with the canon name .
0	the camera is a great camera.it is one of the best kind of camera in its level.everything is great in that ( perfect picture and easy to work ) but in that package as i saw in amazon add , the remote suppose to be in the package and comes with it but it wo n't and there is not remute in that package and it is kind of cheating ... be careful about this product if you think whatever has written comes with package but not .
1	this is a good teleconverter that added 1.5x to the camera 's native zoom . it adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots . of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement . overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots
1	in short , i love it . the xh a1 is a professional looking camera and has all the features you need . it is a bit complex for those who are not true prosumers or pros , and the manual is not consumer oriented . the picture qualitity is , so far , the best i 've seen in non-pro cameras . the 3 ccds at 1/3 inch each are truely spectacular . the 2 external xlr connections are the reason i looked at this camera . if you want to mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic , this is the camer to do that . just make sure you read over the xlr connection settings in the manual a few times and change the buttons ( unfortunately located in 4 different locations on the camera ) to the right settings . a set of good headphones is a must-have when not using the wonderful built-in mic . by the way , this built-in mic eliminated one of the situations where i always needed a mic , a close up interview situation -- the built-in is very sensitive and accurate for this type of thing . the downside to this camera is really only that it does not contain an hdmi adapter . sadly canon did not provide one ; instead they opted for a custom ( hdmi-looking ) adpater that if you loose the cable you ca n't run down to fry 's or radio shack to get another one . : ( the other thing is that it is 1440x1080 instead of 1920x1080 . their new canon hv20 ( a 1ccd camera due in april 2007 ) is 1920x1080 resolution -- just seems odd to me . but then i 'm the guy that will get a 10 megapixel camera simply because its better resolution . : ) the bottom line , do n't get the sony fx7 , get this one . the sony seems and is easier to use , but it does n't have an external xlr jack , it uses 1/4 inch ccds , and in a side-by-side test does n't offer as good performance in low light situations as this one . the camera is a bit complicated , but if you 're willing to learn , it is a wonderful tool . if you need true point and shoot , i 'd wait and get the canon hv20
1	i bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back . i am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors . after hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here 's the lowdown ... pros ... picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10x ( i never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures , although this camera is n't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom ) . prints that i 've made up to 16x20 '' ( have n't gone larger , but i know i can ) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6 . it is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick . the stabilization at full 10x zoom is incredible also . it appears really shaky through the window , but pictures continue to turn out crisp . close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details . the movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion ( read cons ) . cons ... indoor shooting is limited because the flash is n't strong enough . when at a school chorus concert , the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear . award ceremonies , the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards . the zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie . this camera seems to eat batteries , especially in the winter months . i am always on the go , and when i go to pull out the camera i find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again . it comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so i must always have lens cleaner wipes on me . the viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere , but that also is minor . most of the cons really are all minor things that do n't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues . i tried to be as precise about this camera as possible . all in all , i would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer . if you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities , just keep in mind for the flash to work good , keep your subjects close . it 's been bumped , jostled , and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem
0	i was expecting much more from this flash , i already started looking for the better one . if i knew this was a closeout item i 'd never buy it . it died on me with no indication , sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it . now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries ... save money and buy 5xx series flash..
1	nikon has always been the leader in photography/ camera/ lenses . others have nobly tried but a nikon remains the high bar that others only hope to reach . when the shift from film to digital began , there was some speculation if nikon could keep up with the competition . well , rest assure that not only have they kept up , they continue to lead the way . the latest example of this is the d200 . like the d70/ d80 - this is a solid piece of equipment . just the feel of it tells you that you are holding an excellent piece of technology . but the proof will always be in the end results and again , the combination of the nikon know-how and nikon lenses lead even a beginner to come up with excellent pictures . gone is the `` lag between shots '' . you can fire up and shoot multiple pictures in seconds so action shots are all yours . without even `` tweaking '' a picture with a computer program , you can print top of the line photos at home . people have cited the cons : expensive . yes . the camera does come with a hefty price tag but it should be kept in mind that this is a piece of machinery intended for serious photographers . if you are a `` vacation and holiday '' picture taker , then you should elect to buy a cheaper camera . the same is true with the difficulty of the multitude of small buttons , dials and switches . there are too many and they can be overwhelming but only to someone who is in the `` point and shoot '' school of picture taking . anyone else will relish the options that nikon has provided us with on the d200 . room for improvement ? well , the battery life is nowhere near as good as the d70 which i upgraded from but that is a weak complaint as you can still get hundreds of shots on one charge . also , it would be a boon if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like in former models . so if you are serious about photography and always have one at the ready , this is the one for you
1	very speedy delivery . a gift for my daughter . she loves it . i thought we were to receive a free photo card but did not . not really necessary . did not know that . still playing with it and having a blast . i do like that it is weather resistant
0	i added these batteries to an order of a few other things , and did n't realize that they were going to ship this separately from circuit city . make sure if you pick this , that you are getting something else from cc , or else you will end up like me . with a huge box ( you could fit 4 tom clancey novels in the box ) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries
1	hoods offer several benefits to the photographer . primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image , or the appearance of lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality . a hood is not required to eliminate these problems , as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light . the hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one . this hood being a solid petal shaped offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element . when in place , the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects . being shallow and petal shaped , this type of protection is also limited . even if the protection is limited , replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing the lens and easier to replace . this hood is manufactured for the canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 is ef and normally is not included with the lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens , and is worth considering . since the hood is wider than the lens ; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position . this does n't add to the length of the lens , but does make it wider by about an inch . an inch may not seem like a lot , but in a tightly packed camera bag , it is huge . this lens itself is n't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem . while the protective benefits exist , they are secondary and limited . i find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood . considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment ( except for a lens case ) , purchasing a hood is money well spent . pros : improves contrast and image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection to the lens cons : takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens
0	i bought this camera for christmas and it is absolutely horrible ! it takes really bad quality pictures and it has a very noisy lens . it 's a great looking camera but the screen is only 2 inches which is very small . this camera is not a good buy for it 's class
0	i purchased this camera in august 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is november 2006 . kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired . is that right ? it takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time . you try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a can not read device message . i have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives . i now have to go to my local photo place to get a cd and prints made and then download them into my easyshare software . oh , should n't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera . also , i had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock . when i put the camera on the dock , it does n't charge the battery or print pictures , the screen just goes grey . this camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me . the cost of shipping , cd 's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me . kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email . what are they afraid of , they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers . do not purchase this camera , it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera
0	why do you need a water house for a camera that is 10m water proof
0	i selected a sony vf-30cpkxs polarizing filter but it took me to this page where i got a sony vf-r30nkx 30mm neutral density filter . there is a big difference . may 9 , 2006 . i hope this is a mistake and not intentional deception
1	many great things have already been said about this lens , and i will support them ! my copy delivers outstanding sharpness ( nearly on par with my 24-70l ) even *wide open* ( rare for a wide angle of all but the finest german manufacturers ) , great color , very little distortion ( many objective tests have revealed that it 's probably the `` best of breed '' ultra wide angle ) , and impressive contrast . surprisingly , the build quality is not bad : tight fitting mount , damped rings , and no jiggles or rattles . if i were forced to offer a ( slight ) negative , it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat `` marbly '' ... however , when shooting a subject with an oof area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame , then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh ! ; ) a fine lens , canon : definitely worth the premium over the sigma and tokina rivals ( both of which i sampled before purchasing this optic )
1	this film seems a lot better than kodak max 400 even though it is basically the same thing ( except for the fact that it 's black and white ) . i would n't recommend this for proffesionals , but it 's great for the average person
0	cons only , no pros : the velcro closure is week and opens easily terrible look the side zippers are a mistery , totally useless no space for extra memory or battery attaches only to a very small belt the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash
1	i love this camera the first day i received it i took 3 rolls of film . it has been the best purchase i bought this year . i got a real good price on it and i received it fast !
1	purchased as a gift and well received . seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner . runs everyday , all day and no problems encountered . displays vacation pictures clearly . like that it is big enough to view across the room . frame is more compatible with decore than the 7 '' model previously purchased
1	i read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit . i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try . the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty . the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2.8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp . be carefull with this lens though . the dof at f2.8 is extremely narrow . do n't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp . focus properly and crank up the aperture and you 'll get some very satisfying macro shots . the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer . canon , how about a 100mm macro with is ?
1	i bought my k10d in dec 06 after owning a number of pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering . the combination of features , if executed properly , make this camera the best buy in 10mp dslrs right now . i postponed my review because i wanted to get some real field experience . i just went to mexico , and panicked because i left the camera instruction manual behind . i can now report on that trip . i did a little fumbling at first , mainly because i did n't have the manual , but i was soon able to find the combinations i wanted , and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively . the af button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed . i found myself in difficult lighting situations often , and both af and exposure metering worked quite well . i also took some hand-held shots that i normally would use a tripod with ( such as at 450mm ) , and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement . in a few cases , i used bracketing , and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots . exposure metering worked so well that i stopped bracketing . i particularly liked the display modes : i could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight , and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was `` soft '' or not right at the scene . the rechargeable li ion batteries , although not readily available in stores , seem to last forever ( even using power zoom , and full-bright display , and some fill flash ) . i believe that i could have shot all week ( 700 shots in raw ( dng ) + jpeg ) with the battery grip attached . in summary , this camera was a pleasure to hold , very easy to use and manipulate , and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos ( even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer ) . i bought it because of its compatibility with pentax lenses , 10mp sensor , shake-reduction technology , larger display , and especially the dust and water seals . but what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results . i am still discovering its features , but i already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past . some of the features on this camera are unique ( new program lines ) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more , making the k10d a good choice and a best buy . once again for pentax , the engineering is supurb .
1	i just bought this for about $ 190 at the local px . i am impressed so far . i was going to buy the gs180 , but for the sale price i would be crazy to pass this up . so far the low light is much better than a single ccd . the video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape . i plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale . i will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around europe . i look froward to using this camcorder a lot
0	this is the 7th olympus camera i 've owned over the years , from film to digital . i have always been very pleased with olympus cameras and their usual superior optics . this camera , though , is a major disappointment , mainly because even though it can shoot in raw , there is no compatible conversion available yet , leaving you unable to process raw images . this renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in jpeg . olympus should have ensured that vendors such as adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible raw conversion plug-ins available before this camera hit the market . there 's no excuse for olympus to not have made sure this was the case , indeed it 's downright irresponsible . having said the above , the camera lens is quite nice , the camera itself operates well . you can take quite good pictures . however , the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken -- -- if you 're taking pictures of people , they will have moved by the time the picture is taken . the battery life is very good . the camera fits nicely in your palm . and , having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great . if you do n't shoot in raw and you do n't depend on flash photography , the camera is worth a look . otherwise , look at other products at this time
1	having just gone back to using a film camera from digital ( my wife still uses digital ) i have found this to be an excellant camera so far . i have taken 6 rolls of film and everyone one has came out perfect . i would recommend it
0	great camera for the price . but i guess you get what you pay for , bad warranty ... ... ... ..
0	i have owned the s410 camera for almost two years , when on new years eve i pulled out my handy camera , from the padded case it 's always in , and to my horror , the e18 error message appeared ! it has n't worked since . i paid $ 400 for this camera and canon would like $ 110 ( plus taxes ) to fix the problem - ridiculous . especially since this seems to be a very common problem with their cameras . i 've enjoyed the camera 's picture quality and ease of use , but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years ! beware of this flaw that canon does n't seem to acknowledge
1	well , i 'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the a/v world . i bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up . this is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you do n't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up . just buy and extra after market battery or two ( and they 're cheap ) and some inexpensive analogue tape , and start recording away ! after you climb the learning curve , of course . my one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive , and they 're splattered all over the unit . be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing , but once you 've got it down you 'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays . oh yeah , almost forgot , the microphones are n't stereo but they 're really quite good for an entry level unit
0	i purchased this for my 10 yr old son . i was surprised at how , well , cheap it appeared . we took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first , then it worked for about 10 minutes , then it never worked again and we had to return it . amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly . we ended up buying the dgx 5.1 mp from a local store i it 's place . it has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth . not a professional photography instrument , but a pretty decent unit for him
1	i went from taking the camera out of its packing to taking professional quality pictures in twenty minutes . it 's amazing
0	`` you get what you pay for '' most of the time that cliche is true , but there are products out there that break this rule . the philips dvp642 is one of them , a great quality , versatile product selling at a bargain price . this is not . i was hoping the same of this product from all the `` glowing '' reviews on here . however , this quality of this monopod is very disappointing . first of all , you have to ask yourself , why do you need a monopod over a tripod ? for myself and most , it 's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses . however , telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task . this monopod does n't even come close . here are it 's bad points : -the aluminum construction is very cheap quality . the leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them . it feels like thin , cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time . -the head is very cheap and not solid . no matter how tight i tightened the head , my camera would slope down . the workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point , you think that you 're going to break the plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much . i think we 've all experienced that in the past . -the leg locks are not tight . when you push down on the monopod , the leg segments slide back into themselves . in the end , it was a risk i took hoping that i could get a high-quality product for a cheap price . sometimes , you can get away with that . walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $ 30 . in this case , i should 've bought a real monopod . oh well , i wasted $ 16 that i could 've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod
1	i bought this filter for my 28-135 is canon lens and so far it has worked out great . unlike some of the other tiffen filters i bought , this one fits just right on the lens . all sides are even and it sits flush against the lens . i have n't noticed any artifacts from pictures i 've taken yet , but i have n't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens . the night shots i 've take so far , i 've been quite pleased with , however
0	this tripod seemed to be very nice ... until we tried to extend the legs all of the way . two and a half of the legs worked well , the third had a section that would not stay extended . the locking devices are pretty poor . they are made of a cheap plastic and i believe that even the ones that do work well now , will not last very long with even moderate use . next time i will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock
0	this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [ ... ] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?
1	if you are looking for a great all around camera , this is it ! our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all . also love the `` last 4 '' feature , gets some great action shots . we had the fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me . love the new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) as well as the battery drain . i used to have to replace batteries every day , now its more like once a week with the amount we use it . my other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where i forget to put it back in the camera after downloading ! so there is always one in there ! . the video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots . in general , without spending a lot more , you get a great camera that keeps up with an active `` picture happy '' family
0	i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital . the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used . the delay between pictures is incredibly long . the lens/shutter does n't open properly . ( two other family members who own powershot a520 's are having the same problems
0	this is another example of how sony is alienating its customer base . not only will it not work with standard sd memory like everyone else , it does not include a docking station . you have to shell out more money for that option . i dont think so
0	i bought this camera to mainly use the digital macro mode , it worked great for several months , now it will not lock focus , this camera is very frustrating , every picture that i take i have to edit to lighten the picture , i tried just about every setting to get the pictures to come out , to no avail , i am a commercial real estate appraiser , so i have taken close to 2000 pictures with this camera , and just about every one i had to lighten , now the macro mode wont work , i will not buy another cannon product ever again ! !
1	i 've had this lens for 2 months now , and love it . it was my first `` l '' lens and i can see the quality difference in this line . first , i tried the 28-135 is-pretty good . but i was n't totally happy , so returned it and ordered the 24-105 l. now i 'm happy . contrast , sharpness , ca are much better . build quality feel are superior as well . plus the is really works . i will try get all is lens in the future , i believe it is worth the extra cost . focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth steady . if you 're on a budget , the 28-135 is real nice . but to go all the way , i recommend this lens . the is on the 24-105 l is quieter i found . the price is a bit steep , but optical quality is there , resale value will remain good , and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens .
1	you ca n't beat the hd picture quality from the hv20 based on actual user reviews and comparisons with all of the latest models . while this is a single cmos sensor , it is a true 1920 x 1080 hd sensor of the same quality found in the award winning canon digital slr cameras . do n't be fooled by a 3ccd camcorder that uses smaller sensor sizes and must use `` pixel shifting '' . i had already hooked up the hv20 to my 720p projector , and it did look great even at my typical 120 '' . but i do know that my projector probably is n't calibrated very well to be honest . so , my first wow moment came when i decided to capture some of my best outdoor footage from my canon elura stock and compare it to some hv20 footage shot of my kids over the weekend at an easter egg hunt . wow , the difference in quality was even more pronounced than i realized . i guess that the resolution difference is what it is , but this is definitely serious hd quality . the real defining wow moment that has me `` selling '' all of my family and friends on this camcorder came last night when i hooked it up at my brother-in-law 's house to his sony wega crt hdtv display that does 1080i and is calibrated to perfection . you wo n't find a higher quality hd display than his set imo , and my jaw dropped when my video first came up on his display that was the first time when i was truly able to see what my source footage was capable of in terms of its full resolution and amazing colors . we switched to discovery hd on his set , and other than obvious production value aspects you honestly could n't really say that it looked any more hd than the footage of my kids playing . this is way more exciting to me than when i first saw broadcast hd and watched monday night football because it is hard to describe how cool it is to see your kids on video in beautiful hd for a $ 1,000 price point . i can hardly wait to get out there and shoot some more footage .
1	make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of l series lenses are compatible . if you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition . the af only works with lenses f/4 and faster on most camera bodies . you do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body , but the extra reach is really nice
0	bought these for my nikon d200 about 3 months ago . never having used tiffen before i took a chance on a recommendation . vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse i 've seen . build quality of all the filters is really not very good . going to go back to hoya 's which are much better
1	got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well ! more than 3000 great pictures have been taken . the camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance . a word of caution - ensure that the camera does n't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it . the spring-operated shutter is very sensitive . would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and easy-to-use film camera
0	first off , many of these reviews address the actual use with this telescope ... .i can not even comment on how well this telecope works because the two that were sent to me were broken ! i ordered well before christmas as a gift for my son ... but to be his big gift from santa claus . my husband opened the telescope up late christmas eve to put it together and have it ready in front of the christmas tree and right away it was clear that this telescope was broken . the 2 mounting screws were bent , very bent . this puts you in quite a position when it needs to be up and ready for your child . after a whole lot of effort with amazon 's customer service ( from another country ! ) they sent a replacement ... to the wrong address ! ! ( long story that i will not bore you with . ) when the 2nd telescope arrived my husband once again opens it up and guess what ? they same screws were again bent . the box on the outside was not damaged , but something is not working for them . i am so disapointed with them . this was the first time i had purchased something this big from amazon . i have mainly done music and movies , small stuff . after this experience i will no longer buy a big ticket item that would have the possibility of damage . it 's just not worth the headache and problems , not to mention disapointment , to my son . i would proceed with caution when ordering this item from amazon . if you get a broken one ... you just might be receiving the 2 i have had to return
0	i was really disappointed in this product . it worked great when i first got it . but before the first charge on the batteries wore out it stopped working . it was more expensive to return it or have it repaired than it was to buy a new camera . like i said , disappointed
1	excellent clarity even on cloudy days . i have had others that cost 4 times the price and would not match the quality of these . comes complete with with case , caps and neck strap
1	i am very satisfied with this purchase . it is exactly what i wanted . i purchased 5 more as business gifts for important clients
0	i received this as a christmas present . this digital camera works fine for still shots , pictures of my family , etc , but for action shots , kids playing outside , basketball games , etc . it is a big disappointment . i took 47 pictures of my son playing basketball in our school gym and only 5 of them were worth keeping . i 've taken to several games/activities to try it out . i 've tried using the different functions , adjusting the manual setting , and playing with the zoom but nothing has worked . many of the shots are blurred , have shadows ( because of movement ) , or are so dark the people ca n't be seen . i wish i would have known this before i asked for this camera .
1	i bought this one as a cheap extra battery . i have seen no differences in performance so far and would therefore recommend this as a great extra or replacement battery
1	easy to use . produce pretty good quality . it takes pretty long to process between the shots . so you wo n't be able to take quick continuous shots . but for the price it is pretty good valu
1	for its time and price ( at the time ) , a fantastic camera . 6.3 mp is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro ( non-studio ) work , and this camera works very well with what really matters : canon 's fantastic lenses . battery life on this camera is very good . the `` shutter lag '' ( between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo ) is fairly well non-existent , and the only real lag i have is when i am shooting multiple photos in raw format . as most photographers know , the lens is almost more important than the body , and outside of leica lenses , i do n't think anything really competes with canon 's line . the 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work ... i used it at the beach , and on hikes with my dog , when i do n't want to lug around my bigger , more expensive , higher-quality lenses . but for $ 75 or so , you can have a 50mm 1.8 eos lens , which will supplement the 18-55 nicely , particularly for night photography . my one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings . when i shoot raw this is n't such a big problem , because i can fix it in photoshop , but most everything i shoot inside , unless i manually mess with the white balance every time , has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots , and then is annoying after . i think the more advanced eos models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem , and also help a bit with the lag between the raw shots ... but for the money , this camera is excellent , and far , far superior to , for example , olympus ' digital exquivalent ( for a similar price ) . the difference , as far as i 'm concerned , is in the absolute advantage canon has in lens quality . you can use a high-end consumer body like this one , use a professional piece of canon glass ( lens ) and take excellent photos . i would n't invest in a system that does n't also boast excellent lens quality
1	love my new jvc everio . the original model just used compact flash cards , but the new everio gz uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year 's worth of video on it ! tape is definitely dead , and dvd camcorder 's 30 mintues a disc does n't hold a candle to the everio . the only issue i had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic , but all the other video editing software programs did n't recognize the everio video files ( .mod files which contain mpeg2 video and dolby stereo audio ) . i did finally find adobe premiere elements 2.0 which supports this new file type natively . it has made editing a breeze .
0	the camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand . some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures . some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer . this camera 's randomly broke after about 1 year and i did not drop the camera ( just like another reviewer ) . i bought a sony pda and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the lcd . of course , sony said it was my fault and that i must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that pda - after 1 month ? since the camera was out of warranty , i knew there was nothing they were going to do . so if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it ! but if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products , look elsewhere . i used to be a great financial supporter of sony products - monitors , computers , camcorder , memory sticks , etc . i am not buying anymore sony products - i have lost the love for sony and their products ! beware ! canon , here i come !
0	the product features are ok , but the screen is very small . also , the resolution needs to be better . the photos were very grainy . an impressive looking product with not so impressive output
0	this camera is incredibly frustrating . i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day , the camera takes wonderful pictures . however , photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired . if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light , this is not the camera for you . the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect , the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably . since the camera does not have very good image stabilization ( if any ) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon . of course you can use the flash , but then your subject will be overlit , while the background is pitch dark . and forget about taking long range pictures indoors ( i.e . at a graduation ceremony or wedding ) because if the flash is on , you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance , it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on . if it is off , your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds . since i take alot of indoor pictures , this camera is worthless to me . if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light , this is the camera for you . if you want to do any natural light photography , forget it .
0	sd110 not a good digital camera . better yet find something else . i 've had this camera almost a year but i just seldom use it because the result of the pictures are very disappointing . it is just fine downloading them on the internet but when you have it printed on the paper , the pictures get blurred . now , im looking for another digicam that wo n't disappoint me
1	[ below is my recent review of the jvc everio gz-mg40 , which has a 20gb hard drive rather than 30gb . becase gz-mg50 seems to be identical to gz-mg40 save the hard drive capacity , i thought this review would be useful to those considering to buy gz-mg50 . ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i have been using this camcorder for almost two weeks now . and here are my impressions : pros : a ) this is a tiny camcorder and i can easily carry it in my pocket everyday . b ) it records directly on a [ 30gb ] harddrive . this is probably the most amazing feature of this camera . it has the following amazing benefits : ( 1 ) a huge recording space ( 2 ) random access to recorded videos when browsing ( through a thumblist of videos ) ( 3 ) super fast transfer onto your computer through usb 2.0 . ( 4 ) no tapes , no cds , no dvds to worry about while recording video . ( 5 ) facilitates easy archiving/organizing . for example , all the recorded files on the camera 's harddrive have `` creation date '' s as a part of their file information . when the camera is connected to your computer , you can sort all files by date and easily separate all recordings by date to different folders by simply selecting and dragging . ( this is extra , but if you want to index and be able to search your video files , say with google desktop , simply enter a list of keywords in the file name about the contents of the file . ) ( 6 ) the harddrive on your camera can double as additional portable storage media- this is unlikely but if you wanted you could even install linux on it and carry with you an operating system on your camera . c ) video quality is good for a consumer level video camera . the sound quality recorded through the internal microphone is good : i can hear the lectures i record very clearly and there is no annoying noise generated by the camera . d ) the charger that comes with this camera is very small . so you can carry that around as well and worry less about running out of battery . cons : a ) no mic jacks . b ) manual focus and light adjustments are done through menus . c ) the editing software that comes with it is limited . d ) the battery life is a mere hour ( but you can buy a 3 hour battery for 70-80 dollars ) . as with all camcorders , the still images shot with this camera are not at the level of quality you can get from a good still camera . it produces reasonable snapshots in well lit situations . the video files recorded by this camera have a `` .mod '' extension in their name . i replace `` .mod '' with `` .mpg '' and most of my standard video viewing software automatically recognize the files
0	i have two 8 '' picture frames that are other brands , and they are great and i use them for open houses all the time ! i got this one as a gift from a friend , and it is terrible ! ! the instructions are difficult to understand . the wide screen makes everyone in the picture look fat and distorted ! this is a weird size and i am not happy at all ! ! i do n't recommend it
0	i 've had the a510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2m camera . after six months the lens and cover have jammed and i noticed that many amazon reviewers have had the same issue . one evening i took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate . i 'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers .
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera . the colors and the features are amazing . is very easy to use . the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button . if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out .
1	i bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting . i quickly found out , however , that to shoot macro-only with this lens is a crime . it is a very versitile lens . its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light . i pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities . i frequently use this lens for family portraits , the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject . as others have stated , this is a heavy lens . it does n't have image stabilization ( is ) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images . i use a beefy monopod for my best shots , although i have a lot of handheld gems ... if you are tight for cash , this is n't the `` one lens '' that does it all . if you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits , this is that lens .
0	i made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera . the color and noise was terrible . if you want a great point and shoot camera get the canon powershot s50 while they are still available . the camera has pro features , it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag . if you want to see s50 pictures go to [ ... ] and search my gallery cathreen styles . all most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50 . i am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks . by the way , i did end up buy a pro camera , mainly because of the look . i got the canon 30d and love it
1	it 's easy to use and makes good pictures , easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait . i also have a 1gb san card so i can shoot up to almost 1400 pictures . as it is i shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via e-mail
1	small and compact . let me see everyting i wanted to
0	you have listed this battery as an accessory to the camera and now that i have purchased it i discover that this battery does n't fit this camera . it is listed wrong
0	i read other review , and decided to give it a try . as soon as i recieve it in the mail , and opened the box , i realized this was a mistake . cheap quality binocular with `` high power '' being a selling point . it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place ! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation . you will be constantly ajdusting the focus . your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors are all cheap crap , and annoying to have it all on~ ! i am taking this back , and buying made in japan `` nikon eagle view '' 100 times better . you get what you pay for~ ! ! ! ! !
1	excellent quality/price/speed of delivery ... works as expected ... would definately buy again , from this vendor , if the need ever arose .
1	when i purchased this camera i was really conflicted on wheather i should get a digital still camera or a digital video camera . so when i decided still and found out the canon powershot had a video feature , i was pleased but had very low expectations . boy was i suprised ! this camera has so many fun features for both still and video pics . and the quality is awesome for both ! there is a video email option so you do n't have to guess if your videos are going to fit into an email . but if you want you can create some really good quality video with a quick adjustment . and all of it transfers easily to my computer . plus with still pics there are lots of easy features to choose from so you can quickly set up for any kind of shooting sinario .
1	this item is cute . my only complaint is that it really can only hold the camera . there is no space for an extra card or battery . it does however have a convenient belt clip on the back that you could also attach a shoulder strap to .
1	i 'm very happy with my camera . i recomend it for anyone . various funtions , the sofware included is good as well
1	this camera is the best point and shoot cameras for the money . just think of what you are getting . not just a 7.2mp camera , but a lica lens and technology . not a bad deal . the images are not bad when printed . on a scale of 0-10 , 10 beining the best , i give this camera an 8 . david the photog in chicago
1	it works as specified on my sony hdr-hc3 hd camcorder . i have used it several times and cant find any noticeable blurs/distortions using this lens . its a little pricey , but well worth the money
1	i purchased this bag to carry my hp photosmart digital camera and photo printer along with , 100pk 4 '' x 6 '' photo paper , power cord and two chargers that each hold 4 aa batteries , and i still have room left . i 'm very pleased
0	im not from usa . my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country . i lost 1000 us
1	this is a great camera . plenty of resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . the kit lense does n't do the camera justice . buy the body separate and add a better lense . on the bad side , i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix . it was two months before the camera was returned . sorry , canon ... you lose a star for that
0	i thought my jvc digital camera was handy , easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was ... then one day at my daughter 's ballet show , i turned it on ( i made sure i charged it all night ) and it would n't record . it kept saying that the lens cap was on . i am so frustrated and sad . i spent a good chunk of money on this item and do n't know what happened ... still do n't have a way of recording my daughter 's milestones ... . do n't buy it , if you have other options .
1	this is my first camcorder , so i do n't have much to compare it to , but i 've enjoyed it so far . it 's easy to use . the picture quality seems high . the only minor problem i 've found is with the headphone input . had to try three different sets of headphones before i could find one that would fit into the narrow slot where the headphone jack is
1	this adapter is the only one available for the hd1 and while it does a good job of protecting the 1st lense with whichever 49 mm one you attach , there is a problem when you use the flash for pictures of things within 10 feet . there will be a dark semicircle on the bottom of your pictures where the flash was blocked by the adapter . i 've gotten around this by using the adapter with attached lens and lens cap and having that attached to the string on the camera . whenever i need to take a picture with the flash of something up close ( within 10 feet ) i pop off the whole setup and take the picture as if the entire piece was a giant lens cap for the regular camera . hope that helps
0	not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on . i would turn it off and on and nothing would help . finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in . this seemed to fix the problem a few times . after that i thought it was just operator error . but it was n't . the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away . so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile . an event came up about a month later . i got my camera and tried to turn it on . nothing happened . so i changed the batteries . still nothing happened . i 'm not sure what happened . i do believe i purchased a lemon camera . i 'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung . it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time . so i guess you get what you pay for !
0	very disappointed by canon on the fit of this adapter . adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view and create flash shadows
0	i had this camera for 2 months . it was kept in a case and was very well taken care of . i would not even allow my husband to touch it . i was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen . i took another and the same thing . i asked my husband what he thought was wrong . we took out our memory card and tried internal . same thing again . he said maybe it was the lcd screen . we loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse . i contacted kodak several times . they do n't care about their customers . i have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results . we will try to get their attention with a lawsuit . if interested contact me [ ...
1	i am a photographer and i am always running down my batteries ... i have n't found one so cheap as i did here . thank you amazon..
1	this camera is simply amazing ! i started out with a canon g2 , and then a canon g6 , and then a canon 20d , and now this canon 1d mark ii n. i debated and researched for 3 months between the 1ds mark ii , 5d , and 30d . my decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5d and this 1d mark ii n. yes , i wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 mp like the 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally i made my decision to go with this one and i 'm 110 % glad that i did . for me , this camera is definitely the one to get because the 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , and the 1d pro body/interface/menu/layout , etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor . trust me , if you do n't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is , you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide . because of this 8.5fps alone , i 'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that i normally get lucky getting with my 20d . and with a 5d at 3fps , i just said forget it ... no way . i 'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living . this is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20d to this camera is out of this world . with the phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it 's like i 'm now playing with a bentley ( with the 1d mk2 n ) coming from a mercedes c230 hatchback ( the cheapest mercedes that people buy just because it 's a mercedes name and they do n't want to spend any more money on a real mercedes ) . this camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro . also , i do n't shoot action pictures all the time , and i do love portrait photography , and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures . but even with the 1.3 crop factor , there is still a huge improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you wo n't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you 'll have on a 5d . with this 1d mk2 n , you can still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc . as much as i 'd like to have 12.8mp like the 5d , 8mp is really all that we need these days unless you 're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8x10 's or around there . unless you 're printing extremely large posters and whatnot , you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5d can . the resolution and mp is definitely enough . plus , it 's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to . the extra bonuses with this camera which i look at as a secondary positive , are the weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy to use and navigate menu system , you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times , dual memory card capability , you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you do n't have to shell out extra for this ) , longer battery life than the other cameras , best customization and most options that you can set to your liking , more than the 5d or the 20d or 30d . i could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it . otherwise , the 5d is also a great choice too if you need to save the money , and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long , or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments , and do n't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that 's great for ai servo .
0	after receiving the case and trying to use it on the camera , i discovered it was very cumbersome and almost impossible to manipulate . for instance , you can not access the cf card or camera with the attached portion screwed into the tripod mount , also , taking the front cover off to take a picture was a hassle . this is not useable for a carry-around use . i have it sitting in the corner of my office unused , spent good money for nothing .
0	i bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak z700 . i loved my z700 , even though it was only 4mp and did n't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have . i figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6mp would be a no-brainer , but i was disappointed in 2 major areas . first , the lag time is so slow on the c653 , when i took pictures of my kids i rarely got what i was expecting to see . the smile or look that i saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures . we experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference . the other disappointing area was low-light picture quality . anything i shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit . every background was grainy . terrible . using the low-light settings fixed the problem , but then your subject is blurry because you 're not in `` sports '' or `` kids '' mode anymore ( which we used all the time with the z700 for taking pics of the kids ) . on my z700 ( which is only $ 150 now ) , i could set it and forget it . set it to `` action '' , and it took perfect pics indoors , or out , moving or stationary . that 's what i thought i was getting in the c653 , but i was wrong . i ended up returning the camera
1	i have had 5 digital point and shoot cameras all a little bigger and better than the last . this is my first slr and i am not in the least disappointed . this camera meets or exceeded everything i expected from it . very easy to learn , read the manual and use the web site tuturial and when the battery is charged your ready to go take pictures . i highly recommend this camera
0	i purchased a canon camera carrying case that came with an extra battery and uv filtering lense . the case came within a few days and is perfect for what i needed . smooth fast transaction . five star
1	i am by no means a pro at taking pictures , but this camera makes me look close to it . so far i have just used it as a point and shoot and the pictures have been of really good quality . i am tring to learn more of the functions and one i have run across so far that i enjoy is you can choose in certain functions for your photo to be black and white , color , or sepia . i am not high tech but i can use this camera pretty easily . my first digital camera was a canon digital elf with only 3.2 mega pixels and there is a huge difference in the quality of the pictures when you compare . so if you can affored to spend more for more mega pixels do it . the only down sides i have seen so far is it does n't come w/ a great memory card which most do not and i imagine if i did not have small hands that the camera would be a little awkward to handle . it has lots of buttons and dials so you have to hold just right so that you do n't hit any . but overal i am very satisfied w/ my purchase and hope to become a better photographer with the help of this camera . canon cameras have served my family and i very well over the years
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads `` panasonic '' , not `` lumix '' . fits the camera perfectly . no extra room for memory cards , spare battery , charger , etc . it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down . the belt loop wo n't fit most belts . no straps . however , the camera 's strap is good enough . good protection
1	i just got this camera recently along with the printer . setting up was very simple . the only problem i came across was putting the ribbon in the printer . you have to use your finger to remove the slack from the ribbon but it 's not that easy . when you put the ribbon in the printer it gets caught on something and could damage the ribbon . it takes time and tons of patients to get that ribbon in the printer . the pictures come out very nice and print even better . i washed a couple of pictures to test the quality and they came out flawless . this camera is a value and should n't be passed up . the screen on the camera is huge and the buttons take some time to get use too . if you have any further questions feel free to comment them and i 'll reply as possible
0	i bought this recharger kit specifically for a sandisk m230 mp3 player . when i first received the kit , i charged all of the batteries . upon first use i only got 7min . out of each battery , when i got 20 hrs . from the batter sent with the player . i learned online that the batteries still have their charge , but due to the battery 's `` memory effect '' or `` voltage depression , '' my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min . if you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much `` juice '' is left in a battery , do not buy this kit
1	we use our batteries a lot . no problems . works as advertised .
1	bought this remote about a month ago . it does what it says . you can even use it from behind . great little device for the price
1	i have owned this camera for about two months now and have taken about 100 photographs ( keepers ) to date . because i have been involved in photography for almost 35 years , i have developed certain prejudices . in particular , i have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus . in fact , the last auto focus camera i owned was a nikon n8008s that i ultimately sold at auction because i could not adapt to using the various auto settings . however , i like this camera . why ? the d70s is a very easy camera to use and i have only had to refer to the manual to check on a couple of settings and look up some features . honestly , set up takes only a few minutes and handling is not terribly different from a film camera . i should point out that this camera is really designed for auto focus lenses and if you choose to use your manual focus lot , you will disable many of the camera 's features . because i am both stubborn and cheap ( but mostly only when it comes to spending money on myself ) i am using my manual focus lenses on this camera . it is true that i do not get any internal exposure meter readings and must rely on a handheld gossen or the sunny 16 rule ( quite effective , really ) for exposure determination . the lcd preview screen thus is critical for determining or adjusting exposure . i should also point out that the depth of field preview feature is also lost when using manual focus lenses . i was stunned when i could not stop my lens down and burrowed through the manual to find out what i was doing wrong -- which was nothing except that i was using the wrong type of lens . while i really miss this feature , i am not sure how big a loss it really is because of the viewfinder . others have made mention of the low magnification and tunnel like views through the finder and i can attest to this fact . i compared finder views to my trusty old fm and was just stunned by how poorly the d70 compared . ultimately the best camera is the camera you use and the d70 has become my camera of choice . even though i am using this camera like a vintage m series leica -- i.e. , handheld meter and presetting exposure in anticipation of a photograph -- i find that i can live with this level of usability . at some point i will probably buy an auto focus lens ( maybe the 35 f2 ) and make full use of the feature set . but for now i content on using the camera the old fashioned way
0	please be aware of this camera 's shock sensitivity i was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the second time . it 's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world . the result is it loses it 's ability to focus and zoom . it did n't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket , with the lens protruding , thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly . the first time it happened casio repaired it under warranty . the second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $ 137 to repair it - that 's more than 1/3 the original purchase price . i wo n't reinvest in a weak product . i 'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether
0	i bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the smartmedia ( which only lasts for about a month ) . i would have to say that i am extremely disappointed , particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges . even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it 's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious , especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer . so blurry that i had to use photoshop to crop out the left and right sides . the right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one with a bad lens . in any case , no thanks , i 'll stick with my trusty old camera . i would rather pay for a new smartmedia card each month .
1	this is a quality bag for the price . it is a little small and tight for the nikon coolpix 8700
0	i bought this battery as a replacement for an old canon bp511a . it lasted about a couple of months before it started not taking a charge . complete waste of money
0	the e550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed , you must have the camera 's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens . so this means if the subject is moving around a lot , such as my daughter playing soccer , you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you ca n't zoom out . as long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful . i unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off , etc . another negative is that the viewfinder does n't show the zoomed in image , you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot , which can be difficult in bright sunlight
1	there are already tons of reviews on the eos 300d ( digital rebel ) but i do want to share my experience with the camera , so i will keep this short . i bought this camera about 5 months ago and i am in love with . i was not new to photography or to slr 's , but new to the world of digital slr . i had previously used an ancient minolta x-570 , a `` pro-sumer '' 35mm film slr with a vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens . first and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures , very high quality and no distortion that i have seen . this camera is particularly good as a beginner 's dslr because there are so many options to use and learn . but until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues , you can use this just like a point and shoot . battery life has been excellent so far : thought i would suggest getting an extra to have as a backup for long days of taking photos . i have also been quite happy with the kit lens , which i was n't sure i would like since it is not as versatile as the lens i had been using on my minolta . but the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool : i have been able to take some great shots , while also learning what kinds of other , better lenses i would like to add to my setup . **the only issue i have had was a problem with a sandisk 2gb cf card . after about 300 shots , the camera froze and stopped responding to that card . i was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact , but do n't risk it . if you 're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera , spend a little extra money on the sandisk ultra ii line of high-speed cards .
0	it was not all there the part to put the camera on did not come and i need that to put the camera on so please it for a c875 camera please think you w.b
0	my wife got this for me for christmas . i was thrilled and thought it was a great idea . i charged the device and transferred pictures to it . i work in technology , so i agree with many of the other reviewers that the software is terrible -- to delete any photos , you have to delete them from the device , not the software . image quality is ok , but not good enough to be `` sharing '' with people . and after a few days of sorting through pictures and transferring and deleting them , it got a bit old . other than looking at it `` straight-on '' , nobody on either side of you can see the image . it 's back-lit , which is fine ... but it does n't help much . unfortunately , the battery did n't last all that long . the device refused to charge after about two months , and eventually it died altogether . the only way to make the unit work was to plug in the usb cable ; the battery would not charge . so i contacted `` support '' and got a basic run-around , telling me that you `` should n't charge the battery for more than 2-3 hours '' at a time , and that i could request an rma to return it for replacement . warranty is no good , and it ca n't be returned . i 'm holding onto it because i 'll probably take it apart and use the internal parts to build a desktop `` photocube '' , so it can run off the usb cable . but i agree with others that -- even if this worked longer than 2 months -- it 's just a novelty that gets tedious quickly
1	i bought this for my husband for christmas . i researched a lot of frames for reviews , picture quality , size of picture , ease of loading it with pictures and overall look . this frame is excellent and my husband really cherishes it .
0	after just over a year , my lens jammed and the display read `` e18 '' . so i was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that canon refuses to admit . try googling canon s500 e18 '' , and you 'll see what i meant . do n't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight
0	add another e18 error code complaint to the list ! i purchased the camera about a year ago , and have had the e18 error for about the last 2 months . the camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all , just beep at you and give you an error code e18 . i 've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist . nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots . canon wants nothing to do with the fix , and estimates repairs between $ 150 and $ 200 . save the headaches , and buy another camera from a different manufacturer !
1	i 'm very happy with my speedlite 580ex , is a new dimension for my photographic hobb
1	this is an excellent device . quick respond with my d80 . i use it to take the family pictures that include me . i just point and press this remote to activate the d80 's timer and it works beautifully
0	this camcorder worked well , but i had two complaints with it . 1 . on the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth , sounds like a woodpecker . this alone made it unacceptable or what i wanted to do . 2 . i wanted high quality video , but since it records on a small dvd disk , the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk . this causes some loss of detail in the picture , especially if you 're going to edit it and rerecord the video which i need to do . if you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player ( and not all dvd players will play the small dvds ) this camera might be acceptable . i returned it and bought a panasonic pv-gs35minidv camcorder which uses the minidv cassette tape . much better video quality because its not compressd , and no noise from the tape drive
1	the picture and dimensions are incorrect . it is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue . the correct dimensions are 2.9 '' x4.2 '' x1.8 '' ( wxhxd ) . it also fits the fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it for . amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture . i am keeping this one , it is a perfect fit
0	i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named `` digital voice editor '' . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .
0	i paid extra for air next day service . item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately . item eventually arrived two weeks later . i had left for a trip . item was eventually sent back to merchant . merchant did n't credit me for item returned . i had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited . i wo n't buy from willoughby 's again
1	this is an excellent device . quick respond with my d80 . i use it to take the family pictures that include me . i just point and press this remote to activate the d80 's timer and it works beautifully
1	this is a good tool , does the job well , and serves the purpose , but is a little overpriced and canon keeps changing connectors , forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer . i give a 4 star because of canon , not because of the product . if you are willing to pay for it , it 's a good product .
0	the main reason i ordered this kit was for the battery . when i received it ... .no battery included . i contacted amazon and all they could do was give me a number for sony customer service . thanks amazon ! !
1	this product fits my camera perfectly and is not at all bulky . a great safeguard from falls and the velcro latch provides just enough security .
0	i no longer own my previous and much finer camcorder , so i finally found myself in the market for purchasing some kind of camcorder until i could get back on my feet to get another good one . i thought this one may do , good price , looks sharp , purchased on impulse . . .big no-no . i will say the camera takes decent pictures ( as the previous reviews state , almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with very good lighting ) . other than that , do n't bother . the mp3 is a cute function ( and quite possibly the most practical ) . the video , uhh , let 's not even go there . the voice recorder , also not bad - records in wav format and can be transferred to pc . jack of all trades , master of none . . .i guess that would be the best way to finally describe this item . i will say that i 'll be saving up now for much better camcorder and no more `` i just got ta have this right now '' save your $ , find a quality product - even if you have to pay a little more for it . trust me , it will be overall better in the long run . .
1	great flash , all the good qualities of the sb800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire ! it has the built in flash disperser , its lighter than the 800 , so unless you 're into more info than you need , go with the sb600 . oh , it has a shorter recycle time too .
1	good remote . can be finnicky at times if not lined up correctly with the camera
0	polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some `` pop '' out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , `` it is canon , it must be quality . '' since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance
1	what i love about this case is its softness and its superior quality . it fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it . ( i have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras ) . this one seems to be an improved model . it does not need to have handles because you are supposed to use the strap on the camera . highly recommendable
0	i 've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months . my regular camera is a fuji finepix s602z which is large and bulky , but , takes superb facial shots . i tried the casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and i 'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps i 've had that resulted in poor facial quality . do n't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like . i 've just ordered the powershot sd1000 because of the facial detection feature on it . hopefully , it is better since i do n't want to have to carry my bulky fuji to get great facial photos . i 'll review the cannon once i 've had it for a few months
0	i realize this is not a true gunshot mic though i had hope . the product presents itself as cheap and i hate to say the results are not good quality . at this time , i 'm the only reviewing customer and i can see i must have been the only guy to buy one of these . product attaches well and there is a noticable change in the audio . three settings , zoom ( syncs with camcorder 's zoom ) , gun ( which maxs the zoom of the mic regardless of video zoom ) , and off . i purchased this to make recordings of presentations better . i know now that i should have just bought a wireless mic for the speaker . i thought i 'd get more use this route
0	this battery does not fit the camera i purchased . the camera comes with a battery , so why did you try to sell me another one , one that does not fit , no less ? i have returned the battery but have not heard back from you on the return . it has been two weeks
1	i have had mine for over a year , i *love* this camera ! it is so easy to use , takes great pictures , is very easy to use and program etc ... i love everything about this camera . ps : unlike the other poster , i have not had any battery problems at all
0	i have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1 ) a replacement for my jvc gr-d70u , which died , and 2 ) to go online with a video blog . after much study and evaluation , i chose the canon zr800 based on a salesman 's recommendation , frustration as to the number of choices which are available , and the presence of an external microphone jack ( which was one of my `` must-have '' options ) . after returning home , i read the review by miamian `` new reviewer '' , and felt trepidation . after charging the battery , i tried the camera . lo and behold , miamian is right . there is an obvious noise when recording , which was not present in my jvc . hoping against hope , i played the tape back , and , just as i feared , the tape had a pronounced hiss . this is not just tape hiss , but a much more pronounced noise , which transfers to the tv when watching . it rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable . i took the camcorder back , and , like miamian , ordered the sony dch-hc38 . ( i know , it does n't have an external microphone jack , but after all this confusion , i give up ! ! why do n't they make more cameras with them ? ? ) the plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out , and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book . the joystick selector is so easy to use , to select play , rewind , fast forward , stop , pause in the playback mode , and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes . the wide screen viewfinder ( lcd ) is so nice to use , and easy to see , all others ( in 4:3 ) become passe ' . i did n't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera , due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit . the picture looked ok ; it did not greatly impress me , however , and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback . in essence , caveat emptor ; especially if you 're hard of hearing . others watching and listening to the tape will not be
1	the best binoculars i have owned , and i have had many . excellent clarity , great field of view too . nice size also not to big , not to small . you cant go wrong with this fine set , highly recommended
1	if you 've found these reviews , you already know this lens is one of the best canon products out there . i did not bite on the is version , and i have not found myself ever wishing i did ; this lens is everything it 's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light/indoor situations . i do n't think it 's weight is that big a deal . i really do n't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day -- in my hands or in a bag -- even with a 1.4 extender attached . it can feel a bit heavy but i do n't mind , and neither will you when you see the results later on . i 've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it 's landed me front page ink several times . in my mind , i could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range , which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography , considering the 300 f/2.8 and it 's friends are much , much more expensive . the lens works basically just as fast and sharp , in my opinion , with the 1.4 at f/4 , although some may debate this . flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro . if you can swing the price , enjoy it ! my advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products , although i found most everyone agreed , this is one of the finest lens around . it 's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are
1	an excellent purchase that lives up to the sony name . my main concern before buying it was that it would swivel enough that i could point my mini-camera straight down to take macro photos of documents . it does this easily , and the legs do n't get in the way . it 's small enough to chuck in my backpack and take it all the time in case i need it , and it has its own little sturdy fabric carrying bag so that it does n't get tangled up in anything else . overall , i would rate it as excellent
0	i am not impressed with tiffen filters i got in this set . the finish of the rings are poor . despite of previously poor reputaion , i recently purchased some 67mm quantaray filter from the local ritz camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of tiffen filters . i never got tiffens before , had good experience with hoyas . i will probably stay with those from now on . now come to think of it , ritz camera indicated the quantaray they had were made by hoya . the glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the hoyas and the quantarays . not a good sign . the circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off . quite frustrating . all of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them , not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame , but none of the other filters i got before had this kind of problem right out of the box . the set might be cheap , but it sure is for a good reason
0	keep in mind that you ca n't use this product unless you buy an external flash . the built-in flash results in harsh shadows on the left edge of the photos . canon 's response thank you for your inquiry regarding the powershot g6 . we are sorry to hear of any issues with the conversion lens . when using the built-in flash , a portion of the image may be blocked by the converters and appear dark . please refer to page 186 of the camera manual for detailed information . when the converters are used , it is recommended to not use the built-in flash . thank you for choosing canon
1	this flash is the perfect back-up for a studio , or main/flash fill for an amateur studio . i use several w/slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of dollars . i like that they are light and easy to pack and transport . they are reasonably priced . they have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles . the sunpak has auto/f-stop and manual . if you are a real photographer , you will know how to use them . the down side is that if your sunpak is plugged into a wall , it takes far too long to recharge ( sometimes 3-5 seconds ) . rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes .
1	i purchased the pentax k10d digital slr about four weeks ago , and am very happy with this camera and the two lenses -- 18-55mm and 50-200mm . with the shake reduction and anti-dust features , you can`t go wrong . if you went with canon or nikon , you would pay through the nose for their lenses . the construction is very solid with seals that help prevent dust and water entering the camera.the features of the k10d make it a joy to use . i would highly recommend this camera to anyone moving up to a digital slr . i am age 81 , so it`s never too late to move up the ladder . w.c.rhyn
1	well , this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots , but if you do n't have good lighting , you end up with pictures that are worthless . i suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the dx6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless . best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash . plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures . also remember that because you ca n't use the flash option , you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots . otherwise , this lens is excellent . it fits easily into my camera bag , is simple to attach ( with the lens converter of course ) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect . other than the inability to use my flash with the lens , i think it is great
1	this product is so cool . whatever your situation is , if you have a lot of digital pictures , then i recommend going out and getting an sd card ... preferably up to 1gb ( or even 512mb ) , for use this with this product . even if your camera does n't use sd , you can plop the sd card right into the picture frame and upload photos from your computer to the card ! it 's like a little computer , this frame . another big suggestion i have is to find a program online that resizes your photos to the dimensions of the frame ( photo size explained in other reviews ) . ( i downloaded visualizer photo resize ) . this will take photos down from its original size ( e.g . 1.8 mb ) to a smaller size ( e.g . 500kb ) . this will let your store dramatically more photos . so far i have fit over 1700 photos in about 430mb worth of the 1gb sd card that i have ! the picture quality is very good and the frame can swivel to basically any angle and could be used horizontally or vertically . plus , it is a philips , which is a great brand . i have a philips hd tv as well and it is my baby ... i love it . this is a great present for anyone ! how can you go wrong with a picture frame that replaces its picture any time you want
1	in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts , the d70s has fallen behind the pack . ( however , if that 's the only measure by which you 're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it 's quite a good camera . what i like about it most : - it looks and feels solid . some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars . it 's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over , but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it 's category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility with decade 's worth of nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week . - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800 . - nikon 's raw software and control software are n't included with the camera , and are imho overpriced . ( ... and on top of that , nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera the most : - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets , and then pull them up on the fly . - replacing the `` idiot modes '' ( i.e . `` portrait '' , `` landscape '' , etc . ) with modes that you could customize
1	i searched and researched the lens to purchase with my canon rebel xti for weeks because i knew that i did not want the kit lens . i also did not have the money to spend on a 5 , 6 , or $ 700 dollar lens . in the end after reading countless reviews , ones implementing professional techniques and ones using just opinion , this lens looked to be the best value . for the money i really do n't think that you can beat this lens . it focuses quickly , it is really quiet while doing it , and it is sharp enough for the money . plus it has full time manual focus , which is a really big plus for a lens in this price range . the only problem is it is a little on the narrow side with the 1.6 crop factor on the rebel xti , but i would much rather have to deal with that than a sub-par image . in summary i would recommend this lens in place of the kit lens to anyone who does n't have the money to buy an `` l '' series lens . it is really a great value
0	the frame and the pictures it displays are fine . sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my pc . my major complaint is the power supply . the original power supply dies after 4 months . it was repalced under warranty ( after some grief with customer service ) . the raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired . i then had to buy one . that one died after a few months and the company did n't have the replacement in stock . after months of waiting from them to stock the item i gave up and after lots of searching on the web i found a supply made by another compay . i had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame . it 's been doing fine since then . i should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems . it looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now . i would do a lot of shopping before buying this one
0	from reading the other reviews , i seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my a530 . within a month after buying it , the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on . i have to manually flick open the shutter/cover . then , the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction ( that is , it works to `` zoom in '' on something , to zoom back out i have to turn the camera off and back on . to my knowledge , the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems . i 'm disappointed because i do like the photos that the camera takes when it does function properly . fortunately , i bought it at costco , so it 's going back .
0	this is absolutely the worse digital device i have ever owned . the manual is worthless and the web site even worse . i try to delete the included photos , and nothing happens . i ca n't download photos from my mac . if your digital memory card has many photos , good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame .
0	in my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily . it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise . this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable . my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended . i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate
0	the camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand . some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures . some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer . this camera 's randomly broke after about 1 year and i did not drop the camera ( just like another reviewer ) . i bought a sony pda and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the lcd . of course , sony said it was my fault and that i must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that pda - after 1 month ? since the camera was out of warranty , i knew there was nothing they were going to do . so if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it ! but if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products , look elsewhere . i used to be a great financial supporter of sony products - monitors , computers , camcorder , memory sticks , etc . i am not buying anymore sony products - i have lost the love for sony and their products ! beware ! canon , here i come !
1	this film has great color production and performance . the price is also just right . you ca n't go wrong with the fujifilm superia x-tra 400
0	poor and slow focus and flash . thought nikon had a good name ... ... .wrong if you like this camera it must be you first digital
0	hp is selling this bag for $ 30 bucks , so when i found it here for $ 10 less i could n't let this `` deal '' pass me by ... however when i received the bag , i wished i had ... the color is less vibrant , it 's cheap , poor quality , plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag ... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead , it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !
0	the filters that i got are poorly finished . the 812 filter has a smudge on it , while all 3 filters do n't screw on properly on my lens . all filters come off easily . they are totally useless . i suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens
0	i spent a couple hours , trying to get transfer dv from my camcorder to my mac powerbook . after hours and hours i had to realize that the usb cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless . if you do n't own a sony vaio ( which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.link connection , which no other pc/mac has ) your getting frustrated pretty quick . i would have given the cable a 5 star rating , but the way i had to get the cable , by having to buy it seperately , is a big rip off . however i found the exact same cable in an apple store called `` thin fire wire '' . the exact same cable ( 1.8 meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact ) for only $ 29 and it works just fine . so check out an apple store near you and save some money . shame on you sony
0	i purchased the camera in mid june 2006 . after 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode . it took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem . i used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite . the recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen . this camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands . the store were i bought it said that it would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time . the only problem is that if this is a design problem , what do i get by getting a new camera ? just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem
0	some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all , but the nikon 8400 has a `` electronic viewfinder '' and the reviews have been good and the price is great , so i bought the camera . the electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash , you can not see any expressions , just the outline of the person 's head , so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder . outdoors you can not see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot . the `` display '' lcd monitor is small and washes out in sunlight . the background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark . after 3 days of use and 90 shots i mailed it back to `` ritz on amazon '' this morning , dec 5 . they require it back `` within 10 days of receipt of purchase '' , their `` date of order '' was nov 29 and it arrived at my house on dec 3 . it 's a good thing i already had a compact flash card to use , there is not one in the box and if i had waited for the one i ordered to arrive , well , it 's not here yet . it cost me $ 11.65 to return it , insured , with 2 day delivery and a `` delivery confirmation receipt '' . the camera had some strengths as well as it 's weaknesses , but with only a short time to try it out before the `` 10 days '' ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what i was shooting i gave up on it
0	i just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great . but today i tried to turn it on and it 's completely dead ! i even changed out the batteries and it 's still completely dead . this is the first digital camera i 've had and i bought it because i 'm going to europe ( two days after it died ) . now i have to scramble to get a replacement before i take off . grrrrr ! !
0	do n't order this battery unless you have money to throw away ! i ordered one that would not hold a charge , called the company and they told me it was defective and to send it back . did that and got a replacement that proved to be just as bad . now after 3 months , it is n't even holding a charge for more that 15 minutes of usage time ! ! ! this is unacceptable , and again the company is still trying to stand behind their bogus product ! avoid at all cost , even if that means paying the extra $ 10 bucks for an original kodak branded battery
0	i purchased this to display mpeg movies ( which it says it can ) . i was told by tech support that i had to use a divx encoder and that they must be avi ( which is also incorrect ) . the sanyo xacti video camera i was using was mpeg-4 ( the ipod accepts the files without issue ) , i tried converting them in quicktime to several different types of mpeg4 and none worked . there are better frames out there and i intend on finding out which one is the best . i have ordered another brand and will see if it works . this was by first product return on amazon .
0	i purchased this camera from amazon recently . the first time around , the camera tape door would n't shut the very first time i opened it . i returned the camera and amazon was great about replcing it promptly . the second time around , the dv port worked once , and only once . there 's a short in it . there is a reason this camera is so cheap . it 's j u n k ! ! i will add that a friend of mine is on her second jvc as well . a fact i did not know until all of this came about . for two stars , i 'll say the video quality is good . the camera battery does hold a full 60 min . charge . i had no sound issues what so ever . background noise ? ? none here . as for still pictures , if you do n't know what you 're doing as far as shutter speeds , back light , etc . forget it . the still pictures are very grainy . if you want professional looking stills , do not buy a camcorder for this purpose . jvc tech support is useless . camcorder comes with a usb wire to upload still only . as on any digital camcorders , you can not upload video in real time on a usb port . you need a firewire . this does not come with one . also , you need to check if you have a firewire port on your computer . i paid app . $ 25 dollars here on amazon including shipping , for a port and firewire . it took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower . it 's no big deal . amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time , only refund my money . this camera is now listed as $ 30 cheaper than when i bought it last month . overall , amazon was great about service and return , however , this particular jvc item is junk
0	the title says it all : one month the warranty expired , the zoom feature on the camera broke , making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on . the camera is all but useless . the fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly , at a cost of at least us $ 120 ; for that price , i 'm buying a new camera , but not another f10 .
0	i received this camera as a gift and after 15 magical minutes recording with it , i ran into an error message : `` unit in safeguard mode - remove reattach battery . '' i did what i was told . several times . same message . argh ! ( to my husband 's chagrin , i read the user 's manual completely before using it to avoid such a problem ... why is this happening to me ? ! ) i searched the web looking for a solution , but all i found were perhaps hundreds of people with the same message on similar jvc model camcorders , rendering their cameras unuseable with little help from jvc once their warranty ran out . luckily i ran into the problem soon enough that we were able to return the product . sure , you might not believe me when i suggest to stay clear of this model . i 'm constantly disregarding amazon reviews that preach `` do not buy this product ! `` , etc . that 's why i 'm suggesting that you please take a minute to search the web for this error message before you buy this product and see if you 're still convinced you want it . suggested search on google : `` jvc camcorder safeguard mode error '' .
0	the camera has really amazing features . but it also has an outrageously major focus weekness . i made a mistake of buying one
1	do not expect this to replace the zoom from your camera . it will not do that nor was it intended to do so . what it does do is optically bring things a little bit closer . this is certainly preferably to using the digital zoom that comes with so many cameras . the lens works by screwing into the end of the camera lens where filters would normally be put . this means that it is something which must be planned for to be used . it is not to be put on while filming is taking place ; it is in place when filming begins . since it is easy to use , this should not take too long . the normal zoom of the camera can be used while this lens is in place . having it in place just changes the limits from a little bit closer to what would normally be the case to not quite as far when the camera is zoomed out to maximum . care should be taken not to get this lens cross threaded when putting it in place . the quality of the optics seem to be fine . i used it on a sony dcr-vx2100 and had no problems . this is a handy gadget to have handy in your case but be aware of what it will and will not do .
0	the case fits like a tight glove . i do n't like that . the camera was hard to get in and out and did n't have any pockets for straps or batteries
0	i admit that i 'm far from an expert on digital cameras . i did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years . i purchased a 510 powershot in july of 2005 . it was n't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens would n't work . i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them . i can understand them saying , 'we 'll charge you at first , but once we establish that the fault is due to us , we 'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera ( in the mail ) and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back . ( i also emailed them the same request ) . neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon 's behalf . that in itself was enough for me and i 've been bitter about that ever since . i 've also told every person that i 've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident . i 'm pleased to say , i 've steered most away from this company . what else can i say about this camera : this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture . i 've missed out on some good shots due to this . it eats batteries like there 's no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa 's to even make this camera worth its while . i 've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a 3 minute movie ( with this camera ) in my home during the day and go outside , most things outside are very white . almost like looking at an infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during the day , everything is dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras are this way ? i would n't recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think about that . you have to pay the shipping for a camera that 's barely a few months old and still under warranty . that 's disgusting , that 's all i have to say . there should be a zero for this , not a 1 star
1	this small and cheep hood can save you realy a lot of money . it 's doeing it job wonderful keeps you pictures brigth and clear , but also the hood protect you lens from a lot of things which trying to hit you lens
1	this is one of the best bargains that i 've seen , `` essentially '' you get 3 filters for the price of one . the image quality with these filters is great , the 812 ( warming ) filter is by far a favorite giving back the color richness that flash photography so often washes out , that is unless you have the patience for constantly tweaking your flash power . aside from the 812 the uv protector is basically a clear protective filter . while it obviously has advantages over clear glass , i tend not to think of it as any different . this too is a great filter which i use about half the time because it does n't affect color hues or change f stop values too greatly while it takes the worry out of carrying the camera around ready for any candid shots that may occur . finally included is the circular polarizer . this filter adjusts the amount of uv light entering the camera by spinning the filter to the direction the uv rays are entering ( or turning the thingy till things look better ) . this lens is great for sunny days and will take surface glare off lakes and glass making them transparent again . it also makes colors more crisp in general when photographing buildings and other large `` reflective '' man-made things . so things sound great so far , but now to why i only give this item 4 stars . while tiffen is known to be one of the best at photo and video filters , they have quality control issues that do no live up to thier reputation . in my case the 812 filter arrived with a discoloration in the glass . while it was did n't hurt image quality , with the flaw being towards the edge of the filter , i none the less did n't want to find a situation in which the flaw would diminish quality . seeing as it was not amazon 's fault my first e-mail went to tiffen for a replacement which they said they would gladly do , but only after i send them the filter and they recieve it would they ship my replacement ( not an option in my circumstances ) . instead amazon 's wonderful customer service shown through again , and within 3 days they had replaced the entire set . the second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters were in perfect condition i traded just the 812 . i hav n't had any other issues and i 'm very satisfied with my filters . the only other word of warning would be to that of the circular polorizer . while i recieved 2 that were flawless occassionally i have read in reviews customers have received ones that were assembled backwards making the lens useless . a quick way to check to see if your cp is working correctly is to hold it , thread facing yourself , and look at an lcd monitor or tv and spin it until the picture dissapears ( obviously working correctly ) . i still would n't pass up this deal knowing what i do now , chances are everything will show up perfectly but none the less if you 're concerned order it before you need it and check everything over carefully . amazon is always the best for returns and will often ship a replacement the next day with overnight shipping
1	shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways , but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability , which , to me , is absolutely awful ! personally , i hate zoom lenses . i 've got a full set of nikon primes . and while i 'd prefer a prime lens , these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr . i like this lens because it goes wide on digital . i suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it 's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives . for anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end , unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time , 2mm is a significant difference in field of view on short lenses . as the focal length increases ( eg , from 400mm to 600mm ) , the difference in angle of view is not very large . but the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though `` only 2mm '' is no laughing matter , and if you do n't believe me , you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself . if you end up deciding to get a 12mm , you want to buy the sigma 12mm ( i think it is 12-24mm ? ) because that lens covers full 35mm frame ( and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing ) ! also , if sigma or nikon reads this review , please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime ! and if sigma reads this review , i want some f1.2 or f1.0 afd primes ! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length ! i would definitely buy ( full frame coverage of course ) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele ! neither nikon nor canon makes anything like that ( well , canon kind of does/did ) , so you 'd have the market segment dominated
1	i canceled this order because shipment was n't going to arrive in time for christmas
0	ok this is the third sony handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options..sony messed up with the usb port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the trv 280 i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the trv 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality..its fuzzy.. im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the trv280 back.. i hope this has helpe
0	there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . `` if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . '' read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !
0	my wife purchased this for me as a christmas present . it started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months . i 've called digital spectrum , sent faxes and emailed them . this has been going on for nearly a month . a real waste of money my time
0	the minute i took the monopod out of cover it broke . the mounting head fell apart from the leg . the glue they use is very bad . i did n't return the product because i think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords . i just fixed it myself
1	this lens is fantastic very fast .colors that will blow you away.2.8f stop can set very fast sutter speeds .i put this lens on my reble xt and i dont want to take it off . love it amazon great ... ... ...
1	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work . when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with . unless you are going for a very shadowy , high-contrast , image this diffuser can save the day . it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places , so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind . sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo , and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences
1	after springing for the cybershot in august so i could have a compact camera i would actually take places , i 've been very , very pleased . the last camera i had was an older sony dsc that was quite bulky , ran on batteries , and had shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect , so i thought i would go for the dsct5 , since it avoids all of those problems . only a tiny battery to charge , no sticky shutter ... and it 's sexy as hell . the screen is huge and very bright . i hate taking pictures with flash in general , and i find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera . ( and the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments . they come out surprisingly well and blur-free
1	i have to get on the bandwagon here . this is a superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also have the tz1 , which showed promise , but has limitations . in my review of the tz1 , i noted it had lots of `` noise '' and pictures should n't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . the tz3 fixes and improves almost everything about the tz1 and adds some new , very useful features . the noise has been drastically reduced , the lens is better , the sensor is bigger , and the processor is not only faster , but produces better pictures . the tz3 adds a very handy `` function '' button - or i should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so `` most used '' settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several . the tz3 keeps the mega optical image stabilization and adds intelligent iso , increases the sensitivity without adding noise , ( i have not tried the 3200 setting yet . ) , increases the size of the viewing screen , etc. , etc . the tz3 is a `` well-rounded , '' and very capable camera . there is simply no comparison between the tz1 and the tz3 as far as the quality of the pictures . the tz3 wins hands down . in my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - a couple of which i own - rather handily . of course , the big selling point for the tz3 is still the 10x lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera . this lens is sharp , and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results . while there are no manual controls , per se , the camera seems to do very well without them . pictures are sharp , exposures seem nicely done ( have n't tried it at night yet , but low light forrest shots were excellent ) , colors were accurate , appropriately saturated , and vivid ( ok . i like the vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc . there are a variety of af settings , settable focal points , and focus modes . there is also exposure compensation , and exposure bracketing available - and they work well ! the live histogram is a welcome bonus . the tz3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent , sharp results . the tz3 is very well speced out . one nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the tz1 . it was really not to inconvenient , but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake . the tz3 lens includes an built in lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , and have owned about that many others , i am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results . it is a quantum step forward . i also have a couple of quite nice , and fairly complete dslr kits . they are wonderful , and in a class by themselves , but when i want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10x , wide angle lens , or a back up for the dslrs , the tz3 is now my camera of choice .
1	i bought this as a present for my wife . i was looking for something that she could carry in her purse . the automatic functions are easy and functional . it is not an enthusiasts camera : too hard to get into the menus . the screen is easy to turn off ( this sucks battery power ) . and it even has an optical viewfinder ( a rare finding lately ) the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes . the pictures are clear and the colors are excellent . the drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg . the wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary ( read that as expensive if you lose it
0	i keep this frame on all day and night . the lcd backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out . the quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res . is not good if viewing up close . there is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag . regular lcd backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night . this one just lasted 4 months . so the image is almost non-existant now . in the glare , you can barely make out the image so it 's still there but with no backlight so good as dead . i would recommend a more expensive philips ones . my friend has had it for about two years and it 's still going . plus it 's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips , which this one ca n't
0	we bought one of these in the spring of '05 . we took it on vacation in july of '05 and the lcd screen blacked out a few days into our vacation . i called hp and was informed that a reconditioned ( used ) camera was all that i could get . the camera was still under the manufacturers ' warranty , but their policy was to replace it with a used camera , not a new one . i had to settle for the `` reconditioned '' camera . it has been ok since then . hp 's customer service is at best mediocre . there are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep , and since hp has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world , i had a hard time understanding the reps i spoke to . this camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button , which is annoying if you 're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot . all in all , disappointing . i will never buy another hp camera
0	when it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50 % of the time if i was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher . it seemed to become less effective each time i used it to the point that now i 'm lucky to get a reading 10 % of the time . it still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless .
0	i agree with the previous reviewer . buying , attaching , and using this microphone is a waste of time and effort . save your money and get a good microphone , unless you want your sound track to sound like someone mumbling into a tin can
1	it 's pretty hard to argue against this at the prices we 're seeing ... in short , for not so much more than the high end of the bridge cameras ( panasonic dmc-fz50 , fuji s9100 ) you can have this camera with the 2 kit lenses . i imagine that you 'll be very satisfied for paying the difference . 8mp with 2 pretty good kit lenses for under $ 650 as of 4/2007 , and an upgrade path to the e-510 for all the lenses and accessories . once you make that upgrade , what 's left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing . that 's 10mp , is in-body , sswf and live-view . imho , even if you 're an `` entry-level '' dslr user , spend the extra $ 400+ and get the faster 14-54mm f2.8-3.5 lens and get rid of the the 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens . the 40-150mm f3.5-4.5 is a very nice lens , with no real peers in the entry-level dslr range as a kit lens that i could see without going 3rd party . this lens put olympus over the edge for me . for that speed of lens over that 35mm equivalent range ( 28-300mm ) , i 'm not sure what else can compete on price . if you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom , you could cough up the $ 800+ for the 50-200mm f2.8-3.5 , and even then , that 's a very , very good price for that kind of lens and 35mm equivalent range . the camera has full manual controls , as expected from a dslr , and can drive a newbie like me nuts , but can also keep it simple with it 's auto mode and numerous scene settings ( which i use a good deal ) . if you get this camera , imho , do n't bother with the xd cards . they are very slow in comparison to the less expensive cf cards in this camera . when it comes time to get a flash , go the extra mile and get the olympus fl-36 over the fl-20 . i 'm not sure that the fl-50 's warranted at this price point . i was lucky to find one cheap , so i did n't have to research 3rd party flashes . i confess to having been a pixel-peeper and compared the high-iso samples from this camera to the canons and nikons of the world . it 's definitely not bad in direct comparison , but after you 're done resizing and touching up the photos , you 'll never notice , imho . on the down side , the raw files ( .orf ) do n't seem to be compressed , and they 're not exactly small at 14mb . all in all , not much to complain about here
0	it sounds like a good system if it worked . you can not use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have : a wireless computer network , or a cordless phone ( 2.4 ghz ) , or a microwave that is running . i 'm not kidding - i ca n't believe this even passed testing . i think mobicam has a newer system that you should investigate owning . those have lots of reviews . pay attention to them
1	i needed a new camera to replace my very old digital camera , so i ordered this one and could not be happier with it . it has all kinds of features , including some manual control options like white balance , etc . for those people who like to mess with that stuff ( i 'm more of an auto person , myself ) . i used it on vacation last month and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pictures , after taking only a few test shots to get familiar with the camera . the camera is very easy to use and gives you a basic user manual to get you started , and also a detailed manual to help you find out how everything works on the camera . the movie mode works good , too . the colors come out bright and vivid . the lag time between pictures is minimal , which is one of the main things i hated about my old 1.3mp panasonic palmcam , and the 7.1mp makes for some excellent detail in your pictures . the only bad thing about the camera , in my opinion , is that it does n't have a movement stabilizer ( or whatever it is called ) , so it can be prone to shaking , especially when you zoom using the digital zoom . i like that the camera is small and lightweight , but it is not one of those super thin ones that you feel like you could break in half . overall , i think this is a great camera , and i do n't think you can find a better camera for the price
0	i bought the 4600 for my parents in 2005 . a seal in the lens housing broke in november and we sent it to nikon . when nikon recieved the camera they said it had `` liquid '' damage to the lens shutter area . my parents did n't send the camera in that condition , yet nikon claims that it is `` impossible '' for that kind of `` accident '' to occur at their facility . two months later i am still arguing with them over this . one of their service represatives , rob mustard , told me ( paraphrasing ) `` i have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week ; i 've heard every excuse imaginable for why it is n't the customer 's fault . '' besides being rude , does n't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week ? ? ? ? do n't buy nikon is my recommendation .
1	this was one of the first lenses that i purchased with my rebel xt . now after taking several thousand pictures with it i can honestly say it was well worth the cost . i very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod . i also have the 180mm f/3.5l macro lens , which costs about 3 times more than this lens , and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4x and 2x tc 's , it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod . the 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your iso up a little to do so . i have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results . all-in-all , given it 's small size and light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot
1	excellent choice to make a great job .
0	decent camera , but not great . shark mode is nice . housing looks good , but mine leaked at ~20 ft ... camera was dead by the time i got it out of the water . good news is that amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week . net result was one decent picture and a disappointing christmas present . next time i will buy a housing for a better camera . canon has some nice ones
0	another lense jam problem . the lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket , and the lense extended and jammed . this happened frequently with my old powershot s30 but never caused a problem . canon said the warranty is void because there 's a tiny dent on the front and back . they said any physical damage voids the warranty . i complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily . they gave me 20 % off the repair
0	for average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this . i do n't know about the specifics , but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months . so , i do n't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it does n't even take a picture . it was fine while it worked , it ate batteries but the pics were good
1	kodak door strains to shut with this battery . nice idea but , too bad for kodak owners . i have great success though with energizer lithium batteries . they last me a long time and fit perfectly
1	excellent case , no question about it . it is stylish and well-put together . this can not be worn on a belt , though , it must go in a pocket , purse , or in your hand . the main thing is that it keeps the awesome camera safe and sound , and it looks good doing it .
0	i really do n't know how to write a `` helpful '' review for this camera , i 'm not a photographer ; all i can say is that i was not satisfied with my purchase , so ... *** if you 're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get ( like i was a few months ago ) , save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras . *** here are my complaints : flash is too strong ( blinding , in fact ) . please do not take this complaint lightly , the flash is brighter than you think ( it actually hurts , i 'm talking physical pain here ) . i actually fear it might have some long term effects , this alone is a deal-breaker for me ! it 's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at nikon . sure , you can turn the flash off . but that only brings me to my other major complaint ! the lighting must be almost perfect if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash . the lens do not respond well to artificial lighting , at all , pictures either come out all grainy ( if it 's slightly dark ) or with huge white patches all over if there 's a lot of light in the background . even when the lighting is almost perfect , you lose a lot of quality ( even when using the highest settings , 6mp ) . the scene modes did n't help much , i tried everything , all the different modes offer so little difference , very gimicky in my opinion . even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash , there 's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear , why ? i have no clue what so ever . i might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a slightly different pose ( but still stable ) , and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear ! must admit though , the swivel design is very practical and makes things so much easier . the video mode is great as well . if you do n't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash , then i must admit , the pictures do come out nicely . ( most of the time
1	for the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions . using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times . this flash solves the problem . i 've dealt with adorama several times and it was a pleasant experience . items were sent quickly
0	i agree with the people complaining about the poor cs policy at jvc . they let me down as well , when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built . i am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid jvc in the future . i just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit . this will come back and bite them in the behind
1	i have had great luck with other opteka lenses , but i had to by a thread adapter . what is the thread size of this lens here ? i need to know before i buy . opteka , please put thread sizes of your lenses in the description . thanks !
0	this frame looks great until you turn it on . the picture quality is less than stellar , but that is n't what annoyed me about this frame . when you buy this frame do n't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program . what does that mean you ask ? that means that your photos wo n't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode . you will have 2 black bars on either side of your images ; this will not take advantage of the entire frame . if you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame , making peoples faces distorted . i have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation . see below . the build quality of the frame is pretty good . if mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen , this would be a nice little frame . a little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio , but i figured it out . 16:9 stretches the image , making it look distorted . these steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal . i set up a macro in photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse . you will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image . some of your images might be better served one at a time . start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program . 1 . go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77 % ( or 788 pixels ) this will make the image look distorted . that is ok. 2 . then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77 % ( or 591 pixels ) the image is ready to save . you might want to save as in to another folder so you can go back to your original if needed . 3 . copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame
0	poor focus , blurry , awful optics . do n't waste your time with this one ! ca n't compare to the little pure digital camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features .
1	this camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a must . the price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores . so , i look at it as getting the case for free !
1	i have been shooting away for the last few weeks . the olympus 720 is a gem . i must have filled up my card 3-4 times so far . being new to the digital camera era , i am finding that it is not as hard as i thought it would be . shoot , pop the card into the card reader , copy to computer , upload to walmart 's photo service , and i have my prints mailed to my house in a few days . i am happy that everything was included with the kit . i would have never known what i needed and it basically has everything covered
0	... but it stopped working after a year . the only thing the lens sees now is black , although the camera still turns on and i can look at pictures i took before the problem started . nonetheless , i loved this camera , and i think it was worth it , even though it only worked a year . now i 've learned my lesson and will buy a longer warranty or exchange for m new camera
0	this frame was purchased as a gift by a group of us for our babysitter . the idea was great but the frame was n't . it was difficult to operate and the instructions were difficult to understand . she sent it back and bought one she loves from sam 's warehouse .
1	this is a cool implimentation of a much needed device for those with d200s . the camera loves batteries . having two is good ! having the ability to watch one drain and knowing there 's another on standbye is a fine feeling . knowing that there are two more batteries in the case waiting is even better ! for a full day of shooting , you need this and some serious memory . highly recommended . also handles aas ... always good in field conditions
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel ( grey body ) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level . one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation . i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall
1	due to a canoe accident on vacation , mine went completely underwater for at least 5-10 seconds . but - only a trickle of water got inside . once that dried out , much to my surprise , both the af and vr functions worked fine . all that 's left is two small water spots on the inside of the objective lens ( okavango delta water is clean ! ) . do n't try this at home . next time i 'm even near a canoe , i 'll have everything in dry bags .
0	i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
0	i bought a 743 for the wife for christmas . i had a 6330 that i was very happy with . so a 743 should be better right ? every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead . we finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on ! after several e mails they told me to call service . i got someone in india that could not understand me and i had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying . they made it very dificult to get it sent in . i sent it in today , but i do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far . i hope it comes back at least .
1	this is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball , as far as i can tell . if you follow the directions , and are as close to the action as possible , and at a `` straight on '' angle , it looks like its correct in the + - 1 mph statement . however , this is a cool gadget , but if you are serious about `` speed '' and would like more versatility , then your going to have to go with the official mlb jugs gun ... but at a much higher price . good luck
0	i have known canon to be a very high quality company . however , i was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations i had about this camera . a few years ago i bought the fujiffilm 3800 . i loved this camera but after a few ski trips i found it rather bulky . i then bought the canon s500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the s400 . for most of the pictures i take on a ski trip this camera is fine . however , if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime , this camera is worse than a disposable camera . first , there is no red-eye reduction . it simply does not work when i set it to take flash with red-eye reduction . second , pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry . i would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod . third , night picture ? ... .forget about it . i tried to get a beatiful picture of the chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed . so , i tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and i could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures . looks like i 'll be back in the market for a fujifilm . after all the reviews i 've read , i 'm waiting for the other shoe to drop ( e18 , lcd , etc. ) . not to mention the terrible service that i have been reading about
0	a close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera . honestly olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $ 400 . i 've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10 . if you 're going to spend that much on a camera , get the d70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with . the pictures are better and it offers more mp
0	the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2 . of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100 % ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too
0	this camera was easy to use and it was light and had decent quality picture and audio , however , i was unable to make copies for back-up or to share with family members . i took it back and bought a mini-dv camcorder as i was told it was easier to make copies . this has yet to be tested
1	this camera has been called a `` pro-sumer '' model and you should really take that title seriously . the quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution . the trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag ( or big pocket , if it fits ) . why ? because canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90 % of the time when you 're moving it to or from a bag . to compound this problem , the lens extends ( in your bag ) , pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage . so , if you think of this as a professional camera , to be kept in a real camera-case , you 'll probably be okay . if you 're somebody , like me , who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket , you 're going to be annoyed by the power switch . that said , i do love the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them . cons : stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on ; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily ; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still ( around 35mm ? ) pros : awesome pictures ; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus ; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens ; great battery life ; awesome picture
0	i agree with the many other users who have experienced the `` condensation , operation paused '' defect on their jvc gr-xxxx . despite numerous others reporting this problem , jvc says its not a recognized problem . i would disagree - it is a recognized problem , but its your problem , not theirs .
0	after reading the reviews a bought the accessory kit . i compared the eyepieces and the barlow with standard inexpensive plossls ( orion , knigth owl , gso ) and the celestron 's optics looked the worst one . i sold the kit after 2 weeks..
1	i love the new digital canon . the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin . i had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working . the canon people have been great , and very helpful , but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory . the photos , however , are wonderful . film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable . ( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it , so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos .
0	when i got this camera for my birthday april 2005 i thought that it was a dream come true . the picture quality was brilliant , it was easy to use . the device was ment to be envied . it took marvelous pictures until within 3 months , july 2005- the lcd screen cracked . the camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage . i was never suspiscious of it until i took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems . something bad will happen to this camera . either the sceen will break or the memory card thing . a friend of mine also owned the s410 , and her screen broke before mine did . the camera still takes photos , but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options . it is not worth the price of repair . tomorrow i am going to buy a new camera .
0	mini dv cams are better , and should cost about the same . this particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer . the software is glitchy , so you 'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself . find a different camera
1	holds all my lenses , camera body , remote , card reader , etc ... with room to spare . compares to bags costing 3 times more .
0	i paid 99.00 for this little camcorder , thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house , but we could n't get the videos to transfer to the pc . the menu button would not bring anything up , so overall we just could n't get this thing to work . a bummer of a christmas present
0	this kit conveniently contains 20 sheets of photo paper . unfortunately , kodak does n't contain an ink cartridge for them . fine , i thought , i 'll buy a separate cartridge . guess what ? you ca n't ! kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper . why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges ? seems pretty dirty
0	boy , this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens . it 's a great a lens , but this is hardly worth the price
1	my printer fits perfectly , with plenty of room for the paper tray , extra paper and a few other things that i have managed to get in also . i love this bag ... .thank
0	my boyfriend bought this for me not realizing that my camera came with a case ( i have the sd200 ) . this case is n't a good fit for the camera and i 've never used it because of that
0	this needs a lot of light . i returned this do due the lighting/picture quality . the one nice thing about it is you can record decent video quality on a memory card-mpeg 4
1	this camera was a great investment . the photos turn out wonderfully . better than a regular film camera and i have kept an eye out on simular cameras ... price wise we got a fantastic deal on this camera and it was well worth the price . the only problem i have found with it is that the batteries wear out soooo fast but i think all digital cameras have that problem . this is a great camera
0	not only is the physical appearance of this model ugly , it is a complete downgrade . panasonic takes off one of the most important features on the pv gs320 model , a microphone jack ! i currently own a 300 model and needed another camera to shoot different angels at the same time , since the 300 is discontinued i purchased the so called upgraded model . now the only available model with mic jack is the vdr 310 , and i have heard dvd is quality on camcorders is not what it should be . if you do any video prodcution and need to hook up your camera to a mic , this camera is not for you
1	i am a professional photographer , and i have owned this camera for nearly two years . i also have a d70 for backup . the batteries go forever , it is very quick to respond , the images are beautiful , and it has the typical nikon durability and reliability . if you are already a nikon user , the controls will fall easily to hand . that having been said , the computer software with this camera is a joke . for the best image quality shoot raw files , color balance with a grey card , and render the images with software like capture one le . the uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars . come on , nikon , be real ! ! ! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog . i got an ugly feeling in my gut when i was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure , cropped to the head and shoulders , and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog . by the time i found out , it was already at the printer . as it turned out , i was pleasantly surprised : the cover shot looked great . after that incident , i have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results . this camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button . in resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera . it is imperative to shoot raw and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera . i ca n't wait to try the d80
1	holds all my lenses , camera body , remote , card reader , etc ... with room to spare . compares to bags costing 3 times more .
0	i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e . same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product
1	the canon rs-60e3 is all that canon says it is ... .it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash , focus , then release the shutter once , a multiple of times , or hold it open for bulb exposure . although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture , it was simple enough to make an `` extension '' that allows for very remote exposures
1	it is extremely easy to use . hard to figure out the menu , but once that is done there is no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great for action shots as well . seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in
1	yes , i am slow to make this review , maybe because i spend a great deal of time using this camera . the only thing i would like to have changed , is a rechargable pack . at first i burned thru many batteries . i switched to rechargables , and find that i still use a great deal of power , ( i shoot often with the flash , ) but now i can recharge the spent batteries after each session . i use the charge of 12 aa 's in a 3 hour shoot . i use this camera for studio work and it has served me well for a good number of years already
1	its a cable , it works , what else do you want ? i know its not the cheapest one out there , but this one says `` sony '' on it . yea ! ! but , i am a true believer that you only get what you pay for . im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market . who knows , but i sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products .
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag , this lens has serious trouble with sharpness . only at high shutter speeds ( 1/250 and above approx . ) or with a good flash and middle apertures ( f/8 to f/22 approx . ) does it deliver sharp images . horribly slow autofocus . i am already saving to buy and l-series or the is usm version
0	got this from toys-r-us for 35 dollars , it stopped working within a week , if there was a rating less than one star i 'd give it that , they should call it dummy - buyer - you 've - been - conned camera ki
0	i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here . i 'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i 've had these problems from the gitgo : -i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly , they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you 'd need force to expand/retract them . very interestingly , if the section right above the one i 'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless ! -the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) a less than 2 lbs combo , which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs . the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly . again , it might have been a defective unit , but i thought i 'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted to buy this from amazon , it was n't in stock , it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $ 40+ , so i went elsewhere and got it for $ 30 .
1	he adquirido este flash para completar mi cámara evolt e-500 y considero que es la combinación perfecta . se requieren de conocimientos adicionales de iluminación y fotografía para obtener las mayores prestaciones que ofrecen ambos equipos . altamente recomendado
1	i bought this camera for my sister , as an early christmas present , thinking i would need some time to set it up for her , well in less then 30 minutes i was ready , it 's a awesome camera , i was impressed , of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 sd card . i have sent the site to another sister whom is interested . it is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone , great photos from very close to far away . i would recommend this camera to anyone
1	i bought this camera six months ago for my 12 year old daughter . it was her ( and ours ) first digital camera . i read so many reviews prior to selecting this model . the reviews for this camera were so helpful . this camera has been so easy to use and it takes excellent pictures . rechargeable batteries are definitely a must ! this camera is the best camera for this price , no doubt about it . we have taken still shots and videos . it is so fun to have the option to take a video . we have some great clips . all i can say is we are so happy with the camera . we would definitely choose it again
1	this is only the second pair of binoculars i 've owned but i 've used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like nikons and leicas . i can say without hesitation that the canon 18x50s have met all my expectations for clarity , build quality , and ease of use . they are still quite heavy so , you wo n't be holding them too long in one position but , the stabilization feature provides a stable , gitter free image . in my opinion , this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff : the canon 18x50s have more usable magnification for the money for non-tripod , hand held applications . while this is not a scientific comparison , this is an example of the useability and magnification : i was at the beach looking at a parasailer in the distance - with the naked eye ( 20/20 for the record ) , i could see the chute pattern and a black speck below it ; with my old minolta 10x50s ( jittering in my hands ) i could make out shapes of heads and legs ; with the canon 18x50s , i could clearly see two people , a man and a child as well as the chute 's cords - pretty impressive . my only two gripes that have also been mentioned before are : no lense caps and the eye cups are stiff , fit poorly ( to my face any way ) and are uncomfortable . i find it better to fold the cups back for `` eye glass '' use even though i do n't wear glasses . other than that , i am very pleased with this purchase and would also highly recommend purchasing from adorama camera - they are quick , accommodating and responsive .
1	the lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility . the stabilization aspect is a great help , although it does n't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions . highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the canon rebel xt
0	well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version ... wrong ! i just received mine today and it 's got the international warranty card and users manual . i have n't decided if i 'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey-market version of this unit
1	after setting booby traps for zombies , i like to whip out my bushnell waterproof scope and wait for the oncoming herds to trample on in . this scope is just great because it cuts down on glare and is also waterproof . it is good to have some foreward advancement of options when dealing with the zombies so when you are set up this scope can give you good range in spotting them on your trail ! !
0	this was the first digital camera i purchased . i am an adventurous person and wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle . this camera was n't it . the good *it is compact , which is pretty convenient *it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy . the bad *after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes , the camera leaked and broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over . *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use . rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want . the pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . *the zoom sucks . do n't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience . *the image stabilization is a joke . you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that are n't blurry . *the user manual left me with a lot of questions
0	not impressed at all with this product . you are better off just to plug in your camera in the usb port and let windows process it . at least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved . i suggest you do n't use easyshare software . windows pic and fax viewer is far superior to this software . if you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use easyshare . the solution to this is to uninstall easyshare and all pics with revert to windows
0	huge problems with the lcd screen , two cameras within one month after purchase showed the lcd `` shattered . '' one has already been shipped for service and the other one will be going in tomorrow . sure it is easy to use and produces great pictures , but the lcd problem is a definite negative .
0	i 've just returned this unit . it does n't play videos as advertised . i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution ... see other review below . but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture . at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken ... .more later . i have now had 3 different brands of 8 '' photo frames in my possession : a phillips , a pandigital , and this coby . i have developed the following list of features in my `` ideal '' photo frame . first , video playback : i 've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera ... they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along , and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive . i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking ( .mov , more later ) i 'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show ... that is , to play movie clips in show presentations , intermixed with .jpg photo files . second feature is to play .wma music files , in addition to mp3 . this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player . all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3 . third , i would like a timer on my frame ... set it to come on in the morning , off at night , for example . fourth , i 'd like an audio or speaker out feature . none of these frames has home theater-like sound , and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i 'd probably hook up . video out could come in handy too . fifth , i 'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame 's software , manually or automatically . yes , you can rotate them in the computer , but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation . ( this may depend on which photo edit program you are using . ) sixth , i 'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame 's software . especially with the huge chips now available , i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here is where the 3 units i 've had stack up , followed by my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping the pandigital ... .which costco has for $ 140 . it plays .mov video files , but not within a slideshow . it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock/timer . no ability to play stills/video intermixed . i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok . the phillips did n't play video , and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere . ( no remote and no music with the philips either . ) the coby wo n't play my videos , even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations . the coby plays .wma music files , wo n't rotate stills , has no folder system , no clock/timer . it has a speaker out jack . it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show . picture quality is fully equal to philips , generally the recognized standard . if all you want is photos , and never turn your camera sideways , this unit will be a good value . another unit i 'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci . i 've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos .
1	`` wow ! '' is all i can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40 . i 've been using nikon manual-focus nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness . however , after using the canon `` l '' series , i 've sold a lot of my nikkors . the color , clarity , sharpness , and detail of the `` l '' lenses are amazing . the prints have this 3-d effect ( without having to use those silly red/blue glasses ! ) 8- ) within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40 , i ordered the 70-200 . those two lenses will replace my whole nikkor collection . build is really good . the `` l '' zooms are a little bulkier , but very managable . the nikkors are smaller , but very heavy . but lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years , i can see the difference . i tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun . the 17-40 surprising handles flare very well . with the sun just outside the field of view , there was very little flare and loss of contrast . i also make 12x18 prints , and this lens handles them easily . the body is going to be the limiting factor ( refering to digital bodies ) . warning : once you use `` l '' glass , you are going to be spoiled . you may not settle for consumer lenses anymore , although some non-l lenses are quick good from what i read
0	i bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work . i did n't really have high expectations for it , because it was so inexpensive . as soon as it was turned on i had the following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it on , it always says `` usb connected ! '' -- and i do n't have a usb cable inserted into it ! this also freezes the device . i found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted . 2 ) i can not copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual . my computer does recognize the usb device , but when i try to copy files over to the frame , i get a `` path is not found '' error . 3 ) i thought i could live with the above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures . so i used a card reader to load .jpg files onto a cf card at 400x300 resolution . when , i plugged the card into the frame , these files show up as `` invalid '' when i try to view them . emailed coby with the 3 bullet points above , got a response 30 hours later saying : `` coby tech support to me 5:25 am ( 3 hours ago ) hello , we have received your inquiry . it appears that your unit is defective . return the unit to the retailer for an exchange . '' what an inconvenience and disappointment . i will be buying a different product
1	excellent camcorder . the only thing i would do different is spend the little more it would take to go up to the pv-gs85
1	i really enjoy this camera ; mine has the carl zeiss vario-tessar lens . it works grewat- be sure to use the memory stick pro media . a great reasonable priced camera
1	love this digital camera compared to our previous ones . we 're mostly a point-and-click family , and this is an easy-to-use camera that does a good point-and-click and gives an opportunity to do more if you should so choose some day
1	it is easy to mount and puts out a surprising amount of ligh
0	last march ( 2002 ) i bought this camera and it was wonderful , although it was `` refurbished '' by canon it worked perfectly . i bought also a new battery and a 48mb compactflash memory card and everything was working fine . 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired . now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for `` refurbished '' items is less than 6 months
0	i have owned several canon digital cameras and like them very much . i purchased the a520 as a gift for a family member . after several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening . it would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open . the key word being stick or stuck . i took it to a canon service center and they repaired it under warranty . after trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge . i took it back to the service center and they repaired it again . while looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty . it was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time . after emailing canon they said to just email them if i have a problem and they would see what they could do . very poor . i like canon digital cameras but wish i had never purchased the a520 . i bought it because of it 's low price , which was a big mistake
1	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens . at $ 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars . the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses
1	this camera case is great . it 's very small and fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly . there is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries ( but the batteries make it tight ) . i originally purchased the camera case listed for the 4600 , but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you are n't careful . this camera case does not come with a strap like the other , but that is something i would never use . i highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera .
1	it 's a pretty convinient bag.i put a canon rebel xt with a tamron 28-75 lens , a canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and i still have the small pocket for wallet , keys etc . the only drawback of this bag is , you can not put in big lenses.the canon 70-300 is the limit.but if you only have a limited gear collection , you need to give it a try
0	return ? ha ha ! ! ! you must email them for permission . they do n't provide the email address . i have spent untold hours trying to get them to respond . they will do everything to avoid returns . and amazon just looks the other way . do n't do it !
0	the field of vision is too small for any useful viewing . if you already know where your object is in the dark , then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark . but if you are searching for an object in the dark , the small field of vision makes the search useless . also , there is too much `` noise '' in the image , thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing . the ir makes the field of vision even smaller . overall i did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing . by the way , if you own a camcorder with night-view , you already know how how the objects look in the dark . you can use your camcorder 's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic
1	i like using a tripod with my long zoom lens , and this device has really added to my hobby . the remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard . i personally do n't like cables , i do n't like dealing with them . this is just right for my purposes . the remote is also better for taking pics of people . it is much better than a timer in my opinion since i can move people in and out easier and more efficiently , taking pictures more quickly . this gives me so much more control than using a timer .
0	i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e . same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product
0	this product did n't appear to add any appreciable sound benefit ; the sound from the ecm-hgz1 appears to be the same as that recorded with the native audio of the camera itself . i wish i had not bought it
1	i have had this camera for about six months and i still find new features to play with . one of my favorite mode is the sequence shots . i love its sleek design and its durable shell . i carry the camera in my back pocket , even in my tightest jeans . this is a great camera
1	this item was purchased for casio exilim 8 megapixel camera . the quality of this item is strong and durable . the camera is small any ways to take with you anywhere by putting it in your pocket . however , to protect the camera , this case provides outstanding protection and is still small and compact to take it with you anywhere
0	i just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid 's indoor soccer games . the light was low , but not that low . you should be able to take a picture without the flash . when i took the flash off , the picture looked fine on the preview , but came out completely black . yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level ! what a disappointment . i am going to try to return it
1	the balance with the grip on is really much better . yes i am aware there were problems with some earlier ones , but mine seems just fine ( knocking on wood as i type )
0	it looks great , genuine leather , much better than synthetic . like a brand named leather wallet . but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera . hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos . there is no where to put the essential accessories ( battery and another memory stick ) . there is no way to clip to the belt . will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost . bought another handy synthetic case afterwards
0	these glasses should not have the bushnell name on them , which misleads one to think they are good quality . i bought them for my son , and by the time i got around to sending them , i discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in , so the lens was misaligned . it was past the 30-day return date , so i glued the crack and kept them for my own use . they are still not right , but i keep them in my car for occasional use . my advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair .
0	i bought my kodak v570 less than a year ago . at first the only annoyance i had was the fact that i had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in mov format that made it diffcult to edit . but a few months ago , the focus refused to work properly . in wide angle , it was fine but when i zoomed in , the image was unacceptably blur . i tried every setting , finally gave up and called kodak service . i was asked to mail the camera to sydney from melbourne where i live . a few weeks later , the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it . since i still could not take acceptable pictures , i contacted them again . this time to be told to send pictures via e-mail . i did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images . but the pictures were taken in broad daylight . when i disagreed with the logic of the comment , i was told to call them for a discussion over the phone . but the number they gave me was a fax number . using my resources , i got in touch with technical service by phone . this time i was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright , it 's probably due to shaky hands ! it 's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives . it is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent india trip when many of the pictures turned out blur . now i have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people . there is no way i will ever buy another kodak again . i can recommend it only to my worst enemies . i have now to , again , send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far , i am not holding my breath for answers . still want to buy a kodak ? go ahead but do n't say i did not warn you . by the way , my other camera is a casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not
1	when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery . they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes . now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime , a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good `` business '' choice . so i said no . so i got the camera , charged the battery until the light went green ( which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it ) and started taking pictures ( oh i also got a 2g cf ) worked great ... .so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots . keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong , still have 200 shots left for the trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button . so all in all , i think the battery life is great , now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point , the original will work fine . as for the quality of photos ... ..i love them
0	i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera . i only have 2 lenses , but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables , batteries , etc . i think this is a great unit , for the beginner ( like me ) or the pro .
0	i was counting on a three hour working battery . after all , that 's what it says it gives you . so far all i get from it , after more than a month of use , is two hour , max..
1	great little camera case . has a main pocket for the camera and a second smaller pocket to hold batteries and memory stick . it 's well made ballistic nylon- very durable . attaches to belt or sholder strap
0	i got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens . the solution might be useful , the blower is useful , the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips , but the so called `` magic cloth '' is anything but magic . it kept leaving lint on my lens
0	there 's little more to say ... .great item , almost a `` must have '' , but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal
0	i ordered this mic after having to return the ecmhs1 ( because it was , in reality , totally non-directional ) . well , this one actually is directional , but it is such a pain to use i wish i never bought it . 1st of all , you should know this mic does not work with the `` smart shoe '' available on most sony camcorders - this means it will not receive any power from or transfer sound data to the camcorder through the shoe . therefore it is battery powered . this may seem like a minor problem , but it means you need to remember to turn it on and off each time you video , otherwise you will have either a soundless video or a dead battery . believe me , at some point you will forget this . not being smart shoe compatible also means you have to plug the mic into a jack on the camcorder - this can be a real hassle if you have a small device and are trying to loop the cord around so it is n't in the way . ( in my case the jack is under a rather cheap plastic cover that threatens to break off with repeated use . ) ( as you might expect , i highly recommend you check whether a mic is smart shoe compatible . of course , that means the mic does n't need a battery or audio plug - not that it will simply fit into the shoe . it 's a great feature . ) finally , while the engineers at sony have done some amazing things over the years , they were n't able to do even a half-decent job designing the cap that covers this mic 's battery . this cap will fall off with even the slightest touch . this can be incredibly annoying . mine fell off several times - fortunately i always managed to find it . i finally put a piece of duct tape on to secure it ( does n't look great , but at least the color matches ) . considering the high cost , this mic is a really bad investment . while the non-directional mics in most camcorders are pretty pathetic , this is a very poor substitute .
1	this case fits the z650 perfectly by just removing the inner piece .
0	the s9000 fits perfectly in the case . too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop . apparently , the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also . too bad the camera strap is extremely short , made for very small people . so , instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well , i will adapt the case to work for me . i will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera . i can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on . it will work but only after extensive modification . great camera design so it 's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before
1	with most of the carrying case made of either fake leather or some kind of neoprene material , this one is really different . the rigid structure also seem to do a great job to protect the camera . there is also a belt loop and d-ring feature which is great .
0	bought the camera on a recommendation , and also what looked like good specs on the web . owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked ( below the surface of the protective cover ) . turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras . panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one , or own one , be very careful not to use the left nav button . if you do , be very careful on the pressure you apply . this is the camera 's glass jaw , and you might end up `` bricking '' a brand new camera . i am replacing mine with a canon
1	the panasonic pv-gs500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of panasonic 's new 2007 models which will be available in the spring . the pv-gs500 is compact , delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above , has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer . it lacks an audio output jack , which many will fault it for . it does have a separate microphone jack . the menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use . it is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact , uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that . low-light performance is poor , but there is an accessory shoe , so you can mount an auxillary light . i would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings , parties and other group events . battery life is about what you would expect , so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended . all in all , a very nice 3ccd camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package . jerr
0	if you got here looking for a bag for an xacti camera , keep looking . this bag is too small . it can be used for holding memoery cards and batteries , but not much more .
1	i love this camera . i have now traveled all over the usa , some places in europe , and will be using it in china . lens is excellent . i wish it were lighter weight , but ca n't have everything . and this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom . i have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else
0	you got to have extremely steady hand , or camera stand to use this camaera . during my niece wedding , i put in a 2gb of memory and we were trigger happy , we must have took over couple hundred of pictures , however , i am very unhappy about the result . 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy , messy , out of focus . on the other hand , for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand , you got a great picture . size is good , weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size , but to some people that 's good quality
0	the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture . compared to other digital camera 's this has presented a problem for the two users i purchased these camera 's for . also the flash does not adjust for the correct exposure at protraits within 3 to 5 feet . the pictures are too hot , over exposed and no adjustment works properly .
1	the zr500 and other low-end canon camcorders appear to be very fine products , well worth their price -- but if what you want is the simplest and easiest way to make perfectly acceptable amateur-level home videos , have a look at the rca small wonder . simple , rugged , totally easy to learn and operate , no frills but still some very neat features , takes perfectly adequate videos of your children , your dog , whatever -- and about half the price . bought one ; totally satisfied
1	i checked the 3ccd from panasonic and the canon camcorders . in that price range this is the best i found ( if you have the extra money , the new hdv camcorder from sony might be your best bet ! ) . important : the ccd issues referred in other user comments are real ( although i do n't know if it will also apply to this new model ) . it actually happened on my previous sony . i purchased a 5 years warranty from sony for my dcr-hc90 . 5 years is a good product life so i will take the risk of ccd failure after that period and enjoy this great product until then ! great features are : small but feels solid , 3 megapixel pictures ( impressive quality for camcorder ) , incredible low light performance , nice touch screen , great features . battery life is actually not too bad from original battery but you might need an extra . what i did not like : can not take full size pictures in camera mode ( only in memory mode ) , limited zoom compared to most new camcorders and lots of required extra ( svideo cable , ilink cable , video light , decent size memory stick , extended warranty ) . i am still giving this a 5-stars overall .
1	i 've had this battery for 3 months . so i do n't have long term experience . but so far it 's been excellent . no better or worse then the original canon battery . i would reccomend it to anyone .
1	i had a previous generic charger that did not work . well if you go with this one , you wo n't have to worry about that . this one works like a charm and seems to charge pretty fast too . i 've had this for a while now , and never had any problems with it .
1	my all-around favorite lens in the canon eos system is the 50/1.4 . i find that most of the time , most of the pictures i want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length , and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light . i bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens , as a lot of my pictures were n't in particularly dark places , and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing . i was not disappointed . the image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding . great color , great sharpness . it might not make images quite as striking as canon 's 135/2 lens , but they are very good indeed . does this lens replace the 50/1.4 ? no way . the 50 is a lot smaller , weighs a lot less , and is still much better for low light shooting . but for photographing events where you do n't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better , the 24-70 can be a great tool
1	i 've had this camera for a couple of weeks now , it 's my 4th digital camera . i am very happy with the photos i 'm able to take , they are truly outstanding . i 'm still learning all of the settings but i 'm finding everything to be user-friendly . i like the way it feels in my hand and i 'm pleased with the battery life . i purchased a 2gb card to replace the one that came with the camera and it 's been the perfect size for me . the video is amazing , i was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard , so i decided to tape it . not only was the quality good , the camera picked up the audio , which i never expected ! and i like that you can zoom in or out while you 're taping , i was n't able to do that with my last camera . i 've had no problems downloading the pics or videos to my computer and the prints i 've gotten have been great as well
0	broke the day after i got it . but when it worked i loved it
0	it never worked as advertised and total quit working after about two months . do n't buy , you 've been warned
1	i think it very well could be so i 'm not going to differ with those who say it is.i bought this to use with a new 5d and itt 's simply outstanding in every regard . so far , i 've kept it on the 5d and ca n't bring myself to take it off . i considered a couple of lenses , including the is 24-105 f/4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same . but this was the lens i chose in part because i already have a the 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 do is lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps . i have no regrets about it . sharp as a tack and quick . i note that this is not compact lens , especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field . it is also not light . this lens and the 5d will give your neck and back a pain , assuming you work with more than one camera . but the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require . for that , i 've got an 18-200 on a 20d . the 70-300 do , while not an l , specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness , but it ' not a lightweight . these two lenses cover just about everything for me . and i can keep the 10-22mm on the 20d for the extra-wide shots . since writing the initial review , i 've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations . given the difficulties of travel these days , i am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me -- not a problem to date except for britain . but always possible . and , despite the weight , i might favor the 70-200 f/2.8l is usm as a second travel lens- i like the brightness of the focus . one suggestion . there 's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time . it 's very good and sometimes that 's the best thing . but i 've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down a good deal for short night time exposures on a tripod and a remote release . the effect with lights , etc . is considerably different along with the extended depth of field .
1	the gs150 's performance is as-advertised . terrific colour rendering , thanks to its 3-chip configuration . the camera also has the option of full manual control of standard settings , making it even more usable . love the joystick ! still find it hard to believe that panasonic has managed to fit all of this performance into such a small package . final score : engineering 1 , customer service 0 early production runs of this camera seem to have a shielding problem , which causes faint , red , horizontal bands to appear when recording in very low light conditions . despite the fact this has been widely ( if unofficially ) reported by gs150 owners around the world , these same owners have noted that panasonic customer service generally denies that the problem exists . thankfully , the problem is easily repaired by a certified technician . better still , gs150 owners seem to have collectively deciphered that units manufactured from september 2005 onward are alright . look for cameras with serial numbers beginning with 'h5 ' or higher . you can also read all about this at pana3ccduser dot com
1	i am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera . probably below average . i started trying to use 100 % sony electronic products because my computer was a sony and sony-sony linkages make for easy use . given that , here is what i think of the product : 1 . it is amazing how much camera you can get for the money . compared to just 6 months ago , or a year ago , this is a lot of camera for the money . it is very small , fits easily in your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it is very easy to use and recharge . 2 . a visit to the sony website , suggests that sony has new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras that are very similar . this makes it hard to compare cameras , even within the sony brand , and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it . 3 . a problem with this camera , given it is so small -- do not shake . your pictures will be blurry . i am a typical guy , with very little fine motor control . my hands have trouble holding small objects . holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture -- well the results are not pleasant . 4 . i tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras . i guess if you really want to zoom in , then you have to go to a big camera . but it still seems like the small cameras could offer more . 5 . having said all of that , in the end , this camera is small and easy to carry , light weight , durable , and it is also easy to use . when you look at it , it looks well made . i ended up giving the camera to my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend to be technologically challenged . i said to them , just leave the dial set to the little green camera , and snap away . i have to say - they love this camera . overall . for the money , a great purchase , technology is amazing . just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than i have .
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day . they are comfortable , easy to focus , and a great choice for the price . these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel , concerts , sports , etc
1	this is a very good camera for the price range . i have always had good luck with sony products , unlike some of the reviewers here . the resolution of the viewer window and the image quality itself is more than what i would expect from a camera in this price range ... . it 's pretty decent . for what most people use dv cams for , this is camera does n't suck at all . i like how tiny it is . it does n't go much past the palm of my hand when i 'm holding it . also it was very easy to figure out just by exploring the menu on the touch pad . color graphics icons on the menus add a nice touch . a beginner could start filming very soon after opening the box , i think . the camera feels sturdy in my hand , i mean i do n't feel like the viewer window is going to break off when it 's open or that i could easily break the buttons with normal use . as others have mentioned , you have to buy a 4 to 6 firewire if you have a mac because the ilink cable that comes with it is a s-video input for tvs . also the battery that comes with it is the 30 minute battery but i would have bought an extra one anyway because you never want to wait around while your only battery is charging . the software cd is a do-it-yourself install , at least for mac . it might not be for pc . i 'm used to being guided through the installation process ... ( since at least the early 90 's ! ) but i had to drag the folder to my hard drive my darn self . a minor thing but i would have expected more from a major company like sony . but the reason i give it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the firewire goes into the base , not the camera so you can not have the camera on a tripod while it 's connected to your machine . i realize this will not be a big problem for very many people but since i do stop-motion animation and use frame grabbing software , i need to have it connected to firewire and on a tripod in while i 'm working . i almost returned the camera when i discovered this but instead i hot glued velcro to the bottom of the base and to my tripod adaptor so i could have the firewire plugged in and attached to the tripod ... .kinda ghetto . i figure it was worth it though since i got such a good camera for the price ( i paid $ 299 on sale for it . ) if you 're looking for a decent but cheap camera i would recommend either this one or the hc42 if you want to shoot in widescreen .
0	i got to get it off my chest . this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful . but , the camera has several down sides : 1. as all have said , it eats batteries big time . this is a pain . 2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash . forget about catching a great spontaneous moment . 3. not durable . i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all . i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable . any suggestions ? ? ?
0	i won this camera in a contest and now i 'm kinda wishing i never had . practically everything i 've shot with this thing has turned out bad in some way or another . from the autofocus that can never decide what it wants to focus on , to the very poor image quality in slightly low lighting situations , to the camera recording glitches in the audio when i capture onto my computer . i know you may look at this thing and feel like the price is right , but i really suggest you just hold out a little while longer to save up a bit more and buy a canon camera that 's not gon na cause you these problems
0	just bought a sony t9 in tokyo last april 10,2006 ( 7 months ago ) . and suddenly 2 weeks ago , the screen went dim practically can not see anything . the power on / off also not working . all happened at the same time . try to repair at sony service station in shanghai as i am residing there for the moment . very indifferent customer service staff refuse to repair , despite that i do have a world wide guarantee card and the receipt from the tokyo shop as well as the complete boxes . the sony people there are really not helpful at all . most probably we suspect , they do n't want to shoulder the cost for repairing under guarantee from sony worldwide . it is shameful for such a big name like sony . definitely , i will not buy again from sony . change to olympus for the replacement and also cancel my bravia lcd purchase . i do not recommend buying goods from sony as you might have the same experiences ( poor hardware quality and services )
1	this lens has gotten some bad reviews , i think , partly because it is starting to show it 's age . this was the first usm is lens , and the technology has really grown since then . if canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 usm is lens , man , it would blow everything away . that being said , yes , this lens is a little slow to focus . but , if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games , you should be okay . it also could use an extra stop ( or two , or three ! ) because when you are handholding , you need that aperture to be as open as it can be . all of this aside , i really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens . it lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for . if you have asteady hand and plently of availible light , you can get some really nice shots . if you are in a low light situation ... you will need a tripod . the is of lens works ... pretty good , but i have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that would n't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with . all in all , its a good starter telephoto lens , especially for digital slrs since it really extends the zoom on those . its great for the price , and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon l beauties , just sell it
0	me and my wife bought the jvc camcorder and burner set up to send dvd 's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time . at first it worked great then after 2-3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc . we have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10 . we returned it to get another and it did the same thing . we thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal . i do not recommend this to anyone
1	this uv filter produces high quality pictures at a fraction of the cost of many ather brands
1	i bought this product almost a month ago , its sleek , its reliable and has all good features a good digital camera should . worth the money for a sony camera , this camera has the usualy seen high quality for a sony product
1	this case is the perfect size to hold our sony camcorder and a few blank tapes . we purchased it for a cruise , because we wanted to carry-on the camcorder and have it protected , but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories . this smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras
0	i purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera . it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase , the flash stopped working . the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light . i would not recommend this camera .
1	have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities . do purchase the 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens ; for the price it is a nice lens . i tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor 's roof using 200 mm telephoto . when you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name ! without the image stabilizer , it is a blur . i did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting . without image stabilizer the title is blurred ; with the image stabilizer it is sharp . a very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save , or use filters to make them bw , soft , more bright , or with different color tones . people report that under tungsten light the auto setting gives a yellow tone without flash . this is true . however , you can use the p mode , which is like an auto mode , reset white balance easily to tungsten light and the picture comes out nice ! . great low light capabilities with image stabilizer . if you are into action photography , this may not be the camera for you . it has limited ability to store a sequence of photos without a delay . other camers react faster and have larger capacity . do reset default from bright to natural tone . you can do this in some modes , but not all . read the manual , it really will empower you with many nice capabilities . newer lenses are light and small and interface with image stabilization system automatically
0	the plastic stand that holds the frame upright broke immediately . also , be sure to note that there is no memory card . spend the extra money and buy something better . i wish i had
0	this camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures . i bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it ( she 's happy with anything pink ) i was very disappointed at the quality and functionality
1	i bought this camera more than half a year ago . my intention was to get a decent camera for images , but then also be able to use it for filming short movies . i 'm very pleased with its performance . in good lighting conditions , colors come out to be amazing . i really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling ! in darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly as bad as i expected from some other reviews . photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore , but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people . as about filming , it 's terrific . i mean , resolution is great ( sth like 848 by 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera . and the quality is super awesome , looks very neat on computer screen . respect . it has to be pointed out that you can not zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there can do that . oh , it 's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life . a great buy
0	i agree with m. arse with the 2star rating . i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning . not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light . i 'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers . i 've read that it has much better shutter speed . recommended ? ?
0	i ended up not purchasing this rechargeable battery and charger kit from amazon because i had waited for it for about 5 weeks and gave up . then i discovered that i could buy a similar product at staples , and cheaper too ! i do n't think amazon is the place to go for electronic products
0	i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e . same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product
0	i bought this camera after using a sony minidv ( very small one ) camera over 8 years . the image quality of sanyo is horrible compared to my old sony under any condition : daylight , night etc . however price , size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time . so if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it , but this is not a serious replacement to a high-end camcorder .
0	we never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new . and one day , the lens just wo n't open . it lights up then after a few seconds , it turns off automatically . called a up a kodak service center and they gave me a quote for repair . the price they 've given me is close to my purchase price here in amazon ! i 'll never buy a kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs . i do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point . so i 'm expecting a believable quote for repairs . i think kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera
1	i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time . i have tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none of them really worked all that well . then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , and accessories . it works great , you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used ( put frequently used items in easier to access places . ) the variety alone of this system is worth the investment , but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus . you can get a case for any lens , camera body , or accessory you have . i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle . one word of caution , be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch , because sometimes the lens will fit , but then the lens with the lens hood will not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards and batteries , and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets , which weights a ton . but when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt lowepro system it is actually very manageable . the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body . but if you can overlook that , this is the way to go . i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems , in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses . many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed . you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment , which is nice . i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment , if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution , consider this , you wo n't regret it .
1	i bought this lens to go with my canon digital rebel xt . i absolutely love this lens . i got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well . with some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot . i read the other reviews and must say that i have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before . and i have taken countless insect shots with this lens . it is a bit louder than the other lenses i have but i do n't see it to be a problem . the one problem i do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower . when this happens i just flip it to manual and focus that way . no big deal . overall , great lens for an even greater price . definitely worth it . ( i submitted a photo of a bee that i took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example . )
0	well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version ... wrong ! i just received mine today and it 's got the international warranty card and users manual . i have n't decided if i 'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey-market version of this unit
1	seems to hold a charge just as well or better then the original one that came with the camer
0	i bought this with my camera and i guess i didnt realize i could get 3 sony tapes at walmart for the same price . my bad . but i would recommend you get the sony ones locally versus spending $ 14 on one tape
1	first of all i do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer ! ! ! so i will not go into anything technical . i will leave that to people who know more than i do . but what i am is an international traveler . i simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with `` snapshots '' . i wanted someting much better , and boy did i get it with this camera . i looked at the d70s and since i have very small hands , i could never feel comfortable holding it . this camera is smaller without being small . i have only taken photos locally , but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start . the built in editing features ( filters etc . ) are wonderful to work with . i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than `` point and shoot '' snap shots
1	we just got this camera after much research . the camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it does n't do some of what was advertised . for the most part tho for the price and all it is fine . just read all the directions and do n't be to disappointed if it does n't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that . i wrote to sony and they said that this model does n't do a few things . so main point here is read and read and know what it is . i liked the service we received thru amazon . no problems ther
1	i bought this camera as something a bit more capable , but not as expensive as an slr . with a zoom equivalent to a 300 mm lens on an slr , i certainly saved myself a heap of money over buying an slr setup with the same capacities . i use this camera mostly in manual . that was my aim in buying it - to get more proficient in using the manual settings . a few times i have switched it to auto , and have n't been all that impressed . the autofocus seems a little unpredictable , but there is a single press manual focus button on the left side , as well as a focusing ring , and these do me very well indeed . i do n't think i would recommend this camera to someone who wanted to use it mostly as a point and shoot . it loses one star mostly because of its poor macro capability . for really really good closeups it just does n't come close to my konica minolta dimage z6 . i was a bit lost without image stabilization at first . this camera compensates for not having this by jacking up the film speed when in auto , and if i want to use it in manual and handhold , of course i have to do the same . since i use a tripod a lot , this is not too much of an issue for me . i 've heard a lot of bad press on the graininess at higher iso , but i have found them to be at least as good as film if not better . the colors are great . i love my range of menu options , though there is nothing too extraordinary about them . this camera has more buttons than some , but once i got used to them , they make my selections so much faster when i am shooting in changing light conditions . i like the fact i can use a cable release with this camera . i have used it for quite a bit of low light work , and the fact that i can dial it right down to a twenty second shutter speed or even to b is fantastic . i 've found it pretty hard to find image editing software to work directly with raw images from this camera . it 's working really well for me as a prosumer camera . however , i still think that if i could go back , i might go for a panasonic dmc-fz50 10.1mp instead . maybe . i would have to check that one out more thorougly first
0	no eye piece cover - you put your eye on a hard surface hard to focus hard to find objects i lost a pair similar to these that were much better
1	it was everything it advertised as being . i can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras . being a slingshot backpack , my back does n't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags . i like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack
0	received the 'first ' unit which was missing cables and had a non-functional remote . played mp3 's , mov , and displayed pictures fine . would have been happy enough if all the parts were present and working . returned this unit and received a second which did n't work , did n't even have a remote or speakers ( 561 in a 562 box ? ) . time for another replacement - which came without remote , with speakers , but faulty software or micro ? menu 's one deep were blank rectangles which did n't function and mp3 's which played on the first unit locked up this unit - same for mov files . actually tried a forth time because the first unit seemed to be ok functionally , but last unit was exactly the same as previous with blank menu 's and faulty functionality . e-mailed digital spectrum and have not received a reply , which actually led me to write this feedback ! hard to believe this company will survive if they do n't straighten up their act
0	i purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework , and reading all the reviews i could on the different kinds . the one i purchased was flawed , and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before i could get it to boot up . when it was running i was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures . what the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable- so it does not hook up to a computer . this means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera , or that you must have/purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card . ( a side note - if you have a sony digital camera , memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent , you took with another camera , or you reformatted with a photo program ) . i went with the digital pic frame from brookstone instead - far better quality , and much more user friendly
1	i mainly bought this to go on the end of the lens adapter for the s2 is . it does well to protect the lens , but you ca n't put a lens cap over it . it ends up being easier to use without the lens cap ... and quicker when taking pictures . the pictures are very good through it
0	i took it straight out of the package , plugged it in for a charge . charger never reached `` green '' ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later . customer service was not the best i 've had . do n't make the same mistake , keep looking
1	nice quality , but overpriced . does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens , and reducing glare in some situations
0	i 've never ordered anything and been this disappointed . i ordered two of these and both did n't work . i contacted the company 's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it . i tried contacting ritz camera where i purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund . i am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support . i will never buy another product from this company again .
1	do n't believe the marketing kodak does . i was using only kodakfilms for nearly 5 years . i recently switched to fuji based on some online reviews ... i was pleasantly surprised at the results . i highly recommend this film
0	it arrived broken with the stand missing . i have been waiting to replace it at a local discovery store
1	eos-1d mark ii digital this camera i use two months a little hard to use because it has a lot of things . i am not a proffecianal but i liked very much the pictures is the best like any camera i had .
0	like another reviewer 's , my experience has been mixed . i use this remote with the d50 . sometimes the remote works , then it goes on strike . then suddenly it works again . same distance and angle from the camera . i changed the battery - same result . i hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable
0	having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch , i was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas , to see what a commercial frame would be like . after using it for a few weeks , i have to say that if it was n't a present i would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation . the good : * screen is bright , images look great * resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me . does n't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen . * computer connection worked great - i plugged it into my xp box , all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up . it would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue . the bad : my main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before . if i bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $ 50 , i could have forgiven it for the poor design , but in 2007 , for $ 180 , it is completely unacceptable . we live in the future here people , get with the program ! i have not used other frames on the market , but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12 '' screen on ebay for $ 70 , strap it into a cheap frame and make your own , pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame , just by running a screen saver for under $ 150 , i 'd say this frame is not worth the money at all . this screen just does n't deliver the goods for the price . some details : * menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance , you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the `` setup '' button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global * remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny ir hole in the front of the screen . * screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame ( i.e . as a 480x640 frame ) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this `` feature '' off . * the slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images . your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that does n't change . * no way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system . * good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens
0	i was so dissapointed with this camera ! i purchased a sony cybershot 3 years ago and , it had been such a great camera , i automatically thought this newer model would be great . almost every picture i took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out ! as an experienced cybershot user , i tried all settings to fix the problem , but no luck . terrible for capturing a child 's first steps , as the description says . would not recommend
0	i thought i was ordering the right size batteries , but i found out too late this was not the case . now i am unable to get full credit for them when i return them
0	i have two 8 '' picture frames that are other brands , and they are great and i use them for open houses all the time ! i got this one as a gift from a friend , and it is terrible ! ! the instructions are difficult to understand . the wide screen makes everyone in the picture look fat and distorted ! this is a weird size and i am not happy at all ! ! i do n't recommend it
0	i recommend not to purchase this item . look for another one . the lens itself seems ok , although i ca n't really say , but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal . the adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in , or is quickly released . this would be great , except for two very important things . one , the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter . this causes some major distortion , especially when moving . two , the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable . in fact it is so cheaply thin that i am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic . one drop , even a small one , and it is done for
0	the quality of the pictures are nice when they will actually print . unless you use the printer with your camera on the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work . if you decide to crop the picture on your pc and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work ! i have had it for sometime now and i have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing .
1	i did n't have a ton of time to research this flash . i 've used it now on several occasions with my canon 5d and could n't be happier with it . it 's great for shooting portraits . i can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up . i would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser - get 's rid of the typical flash harsh light
1	i will not repeat what other reviews have stated already , all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc . the only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a rolex watch . it is hard even in manual mode ( and i actually have alot of digital camera experience ) . forget trying to focus in auto mode , it wo n't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress . if you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items ( jewelery , insects , etc . ) then i recommend buying a digital slr camera , nikon d50 is a good one ! this fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people , cars , buildings , sites , etc
0	there 's little more to say ... .great item , almost a `` must have '' , but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal
0	junk . you will get a lens cap error in about a year or so , where it will tell you lens cap is on and you will not be able to record anymore
1	the controls are a little complicated to get used to , especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable . after i bought it , i took the d10 to budapest , hungary . i had a great view of the danube and set my camera up for night shots . it did a brilliant job . how about this : take a digital night shot ( use the largest image size possible ) , use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through shutterfly.com . image remained amazingly sharp . colors were fantastic . the camera made it easy to look like a pro . the only gripe i have with this camera is that i wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive canon digitals , but this can be overcome with software so it 's not a huge issue . the price is great , it has a magnesium body ( vs. the rebel 's plastic body ) . you get a lot of the d1/d20/d30 , without the cost
0	i originally purchased the samsung duocam scd6040 . it fortunately broke 1 week before the warranty ran out . the video began having giant pixilated squares when video taping and on playback . though under warranty , it still cost me $ 49 ( their fee ) to send in the camera for a repair . the repaired camera came back broken . i had to deal with many customer service people , but finally got them to agree mine was a `` lemon '' and they sent me the scd6550 . now 10 months later , the video and playback on this duocam has broken . you see a black screen with yellow blocks on the lcd and through the viewfinder . i can not video tape or playback anything on tape . it is not under warranty . i ca n't believe their cameras/duocams do n't last longer than one year . they must use cheap parts . please save yourself the headache and chose another brand .
1	i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it -- it 's size . it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera . i take it with me everywhere , literally , it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i do n't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable . there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched . the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good -- but i was wrong ! the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration ) . however , i do have a few things to complain about ... first off , the battery . this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station -- there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there . not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short . the longest i 've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes . this is n't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine . another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function . such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in ... wrong ! very wrong . the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet . even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up . the flash is very weak . really dissapointing . if you are inside , you ca n't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room . the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function . the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject . to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem . the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot . these are all the flaws i found in the camera , it 's not my first choice in cameras , i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size . if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice .
1	i decided i wanted this a while before i got it . as i read reveiws i realized majority of them were postive . there is nothing wrong with it , the microphone works really good but you can not watch your videos with sound on the camera . it can take around 300 some pictures and about 60 minutes of video on super sine mode , where it uses the most megapixels . it is definetly something i would recommend for anyone
1	canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price . i purchased this for a recent trip to grand cayman and cozumel . i did n't go scuba diving on this trip , but i did take the camera snorkeling ( diving to depths ~20ft ) . it worked flawlessly and i got some pictures i was very happy with ! one thing i did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water . going from ac to the hot humid outdoors , my eos rebel fogged up ( condensation ) and even after 30 minutes i could n't take good pictures . with the sd110 in the uw housing , i just wipped the housing 's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and i was able to take clear pictures . the instructions are pretty good , but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the o-ring seal for cleaning/lubing . once i figured it out , it was n't so hard . the sd110 may be getting a little old , but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing i do n't have so much money tied up in the system that i would be devestated if it was lost or stolen . i will probably upgrade to the sd550 or sd500 ( they both use the same batteries as the sd110 ) with the wp-dc80 or wp-dc70 housing at some time in the near future , but i will definitely keep the sd110 and wp-dc10 as backups
1	i am thrilled with this lens 's capabilities and the pictures it does . i test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that i like so well . well , it did great as it came but i found that i wanted to have the 1/1 capability so i bought the add-on converter and am thrilled to have added both of these necessary items for my set-up . i like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what i like to specialize in . this lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . as usual , it 's great canon glass that does the trick
1	i waited a long time for canon to come out with image-stabilized binoculars in a 100 % waterproof design . these were worth the wait . i bought mine specifically for a cruise up alaska 's inside passage . one of our sight-seeing excursions was on a 45-foot boat in heavy seas . a fellow on this trip had a massive set of fujinon 16x40 gyro-stabilized binoculars that sell for nearly $ 6,000 . we spent time comparing my canon binoculars to his fujinons . optically there is no comparison . the canons , while not as superb optically as the best leica binoculars , are awfully good . they are far brighter , much sharper , and more accurate in their color rendition than the fujinons . the only reason to spend an extra $ 4,500+ on the fujinons is if you require the absolute best image stabilization that money can buy . if you are using binoculars in very severe conditions ( high seas , etc . ) you will get better performance with the gyro-stabilization in the fujinons . in 99 % of applications you will get far better results with the canons . though the fujinons are higher in their rated magnification the only time you 'll see a difference is under conditions where motion is severe . in calmer seas ( not calm , just not severe ) you will be better off with the canons ; the fuji 's are so much dimmer and lacking in clarity that the canons make up the magnification difference fairly quickly . finally , the waterproof aspect of these binoculars really is worth having . on the above-mentioned trip we were buffeted by rain and spray from the waves . the canons functioned flawlessly without a hitch , and cleaned up nicely afterwards . these are one of the best products i 've ever used , and lived up to their performance claims in every regard . one point to note : if you want the maximum battery life it is well worth buying lithium aa batteries to use with these binoculars ; this will greatly extend your battery life , particularly in cold weather
1	i recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my digital rebel xl . my worries were needless : just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that i have . when attached to my eos elan 7n film camera , however , the lens really truly comes into its own , as the full frame 35mm slr delivers the entire focal range of this lens . the focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-l grade lens . and i agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it , like the l lenses have . this glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses , and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money . solidly built too , with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it . i highly recommend it
0	i paid extra for air next day service . item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately . item eventually arrived two weeks later . i had left for a trip . item was eventually sent back to merchant . merchant did n't credit me for item returned . i had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited . i wo n't buy from willoughby 's again
0	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $ 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .
1	just returned from a trip to hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test . i was very pleased with the results . this is a powerful lens , yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use . i was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds , zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera ( canon eos 20d ) and virtually every shot was a keeper . the is feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus . usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one . i shot in both portrait and landscape mode and i did n't see any problems with focus , clarity or sharpness . all the images were clean and razor sharp . if you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment , i highly recommend this lens for your arsenal .
0	i purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera . it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase , the flash stopped working . the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light . i would not recommend this camera .
0	it looks cool and it 's easy to carry , but that is about it . camera is slow and pictures are often blurry . sorry i wasted my money on this one . get one of the new ones with vr so you do n't have that issue .
1	puts a protective glass over your expensive gla $ $ without distortion .
1	takes great pics and the 3 '' screen is really nice . wall plug in recharger is nice also . i have taken pics outside in sunny , overcast , rainy conditions . indoors at sporting events and around the house . in all settings the pics have been truly wonderful . a few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics . however , as canon 's top of the line powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom . 3x isnt enough when other , cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom . also image stabilzation should be included
1	i like this small thing . work great and cheap
0	if you are shoting kid at the swiming pool , it 's ok. but , if you are the open water diver , please do n't buy it . i try it yesterday , it will not work after 10m/33ft , it will show the red screen and count down timer , it scare me . and i miss a lot of shot for yesterday 's dive . it 's really disappointed to me
1	canon 's bg-e3 battery grip is one awesome extra you can not be without . i found the extra weight and size not to be even a minor burden . i rec 'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th st photo did a fantastic job ( once again )
0	this is first canon product that has disappointed me with its quality . they must acquire them from their chinese supplier for about 98 cents . this plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position . i bought it to use with the canon 250d close-up lens and it 's barely adequate for that function . canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks .
1	i have been using my sony cybershot dscn1 8.1mp for about a month now . it 's so easy to use . and , i love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen . the only issue i have with it , is that i ca n't use the memory pro stick with my sony photo printer ( a 5 year old model ) , because the stick is not compatible . ps : do n't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera . you 're gon na need it .
0	im not from usa . my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country . i lost 1000 us
1	i went the ( thinking it was cheaper ) ebay route- for about $ 10 more i got a new one here and it works . ebay is nice , but when it comes to stuff like this i learned my lesson . i 've never gone wrong ordering from amazon , in fact i just ordered an oem nb-3l battery for my sd500 ; tried the radio slop route and it wo n't go over 20 pictures . again , shame on me for trying to go cheap
0	so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont.then after a week it just stops working.dont get it , theres no flash whatsoeve
1	very nice bag and well made . however , i bought it for the canon dc100 dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment ( cords and charger ) .
1	this is one of the best camcorders in the market today and i would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to buy a mini-dv camcorder positive factors : - very small and easy to hold with one hand . can be easily attached even to a mini-tripod with ease . - excellent widescreen video and hi-fi audio . your videos finally get that `` hollywood '' feel when you shoot movies in 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) . even if you do n't have a widescreen tv currently , you will very soon have one as more and more people are buying them . so its better to buy this camcorder and shoot in 16:9 format to enjoy your movies later in widescreen format . - includes widescreen rotatable lcd so what you see is what you get when you shoot in 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) - good battery life . one extra battery is enough . you can easily manage a day 's worth of shooting with two batteries before recharging them again - includes docking station making it easier to connect to computer or tv . if you have a good computer with a firewire port , please buy a firewire cable to connect the camcorder to your computer . you can download your movie in excellent clarity in .avi format and edit it as required - make sure to change the audio setting to 16 bit ( instead of the default 12 bit ) for very good hi-fi audio - touchscreen menu system is great . you do n't have to search for any buttons as they are all available in the touchscreen menu itself . - 10x optical zoom is more than sufficient for ordinary home videos . anything more produces more `` shaking '' and would necessiate the use of a tripod . when you shoot without a tripod , 10x is the best zoom you can achieve without worrying about shaky videos - widescreen still photo . the photo clarity is ok not too good . so please do n't expect great shots . since the photo is in 16:9 format , you can take panoramic photos and cover more people in group shots - nightshot : cool feature that records using infrared light . useful for shooting at night as you can record a video even in 100 % darkness - color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you are running down on batteries and need to use the viewfinder . the color widescreen viewfinder gives an excellent picture and is as good as the lcd in clarity negative factors : - outdoor videos especially in bright sunlight are overexposed . so please adjust the white balance when shooting outdoors . add the white-balance menu to your shortcuts so that you can easily access it and return to default once you start shooting indoors - sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks ( best to turn off the button click `` beep '' sound ) . notes : - use a fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times on the same cassette . the head tends to get dirty if you re-record on the same cassette more than 3 times - you can edit movies in windowx xp using windows movie maker , but beware it does not support 16:9 ratio video . hence your videos look ugly as you shot them in 16:9 but movie maker converted it to 4:3 . invest in pinnacle software version 9 or 10 for better movie editing capabilities . pinnacle is the only software , i am aware of , that preserves teh 16:9 ratio . even roxio could not allow 16:9 format . - you can also invest in wide-angle lens as it gives excellent coverage
0	this is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against . the first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x . do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope ? nothing but a dim blur . note that the objective ( main ) lens is 60mm . all telescope optics have inherent limitations ; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x . therefore , with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x , increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown , and that 's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good . the finder is useless , smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30 . finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating . the low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope , depending on its design and field of view . that the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing . and do n't even think of using the 4mm ( high power ) eyepiece or the barlow . i do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners . their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography , and for this they require careful setup . the equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress naïve buyers with its complex `` scientific '' appearance . in a way , it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope . their upper-tier instruments are quite good , but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this . in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models . just make sure , gentle reader , to stay away from the toys . using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar . it is a learned skill . and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope . buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving . if you want to see the wonders of the sky , contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties . the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started . the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars ( decent ones are available on amazon ) , then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm ( 6-8 '' ) dobsonian ; celestron 's own 6 '' starhopper can be found on amazon for under $ 290 . for more information on buying telescopes , see my encyclopedic guide on amazon : `` so you want to buy a telescope .
1	let 's be honest ... a `` kit lens '' that adds approximately $ 70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be canon l-series quality . sure , you can find a better quality lens , but not for $ 70 you ca n't ! i plan to use this lens as a knock around lens that allows me to get more familiar with my camera and run off some shots . personally ( and this is a personal preference ) , i find that i tend to want to be closer to subjects anyway - with the 1.6x factor on the rebel xt , i 'm in great shape with some of my other lenses . if you do n't happen to already have a super wide lens in your arsenal , and you are getting a digital eos with the 1.6x magnification factor , then buy this lens . please do n't let some of the other `` lens snobs '' sway you - a few of which are actually `` posers '' that snap less than 500 pix per year and spend more time looking at the technical aspects of the picture instead of its true artistic value . i can hear them now.. `` it is n't contrasty enough '' , `` the barrel distortion is horrible at the wide end '' , `` pin cushion is significant '' ... i say bah ! ! are these statements true ... sure they are ... to a degree . but let 's remember that not everyone can afford to be as picky . buy the lens , load the camera with a fresh battery and a blank memory card and get out there ! ! if you find yourself shooting at the wide end often , then sell/give this lens to a colleague and go in search of another ( higher quality ) lens ... very little lost . enjoy yourselves and take lots of pictures ... good luck
0	i ca n't speak to how well the product performs because mine was doa . customer service was unable to do anything over the phone . since it was purchased as a gift and i had time before christmas , i opted for a different brand . does n't inspire confidence in their quality control when a unit fails to start up fresh out of the box
1	if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt , you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor . if you love the fish eye style and have that camera , you 'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip . i was disapointed with this lens for that reason . the sigma 8mm is great . a note to the reviewer below . sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones . this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy . it happens often enough with sigma gear . with this lens , its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want . bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out . decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy . i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge . sounds like you got a bad one
1	i 've had this camera for three years . i bought it new , when it was cutting edge and very expensive . i put a 128mb cf card in it . first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software . i 've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it , it 's been all over the country . the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i have n't had any problems with it . the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder . if battery life were that big a deal , one could purchase a second battery and rotate . all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera . they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great . when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin . scratches , oil , freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific . it requires extensive photoshopping to fix the flaws . other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better . i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture . by the time the shot 's taken , something ( especially a squirmy child or a sports play ) has invariably moved and it 's not the exact picture you wanted . i 'm going to buy a real single-lens reflex ( slr ) to take baby pictures , but i 'll keep this as a travel camera
0	i 'm sure that if the camera worked properly , it would have been fantastic ; however , i received a camera on my birthday this year , only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism . i took 4 blurry shots of my son 's birthday party , and the next time i turned the camera on , the lcd screen was broken . we purchased the extended warranty from best buy , so when i brought the camera ( 10 days old , mind you ) in for repair , they insisted that i 'd dropped it and broken it ( which i had n't ) , even though there were no signs of external damage ... no scratches , dents or anything . after sending it in , best buy informed me that it would cost us $ 180 to fix , and that they would n't fix the focussing mechanism until i 'd paid for the lcd screen to be fixed . disgusted , i retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed . i contacted sony , who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair . i ended up receiving a call from their repair center , informing me that it would cost me $ 180 to repair and that lcd screens are not covered , whether i received it broken or not . i tried a third time for repair , only to be told that i would have to pay . my mother tried to use her buyer 's protection plan from her visa ( it was a birthday gift from her to me ) , only to have her money refunded , then re-charged months later when best buy 's legal department would n't pay her visa bill . based upon our experiences ( among other bad experiences with best buy ) , we stopped shopping at best buy , and now own a lovely olympus camera . do n't buy the sony cybershot dsc-t9
0	the default supplier for this item is adorama . they have sku numbers mixed up on the back end , so they will ship you the hp 6221 dock instead . will not work with the r series . they do not even carry the actual hp 8887 dock . huge hassles , so click on the new and used link and buy directly from amazon . it 's a few dollars more , but at least you get the right item
1	though the lenses for my nikon d50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this uv protection filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense . i feel less stress when i clean the filter lens than if i was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass . this size , 52mm , was what was specified for my d50 and it fits perfectly , as it should . i have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller . if you are new to digital slr 's like i was then get this filter to protect your lens . and spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens .
1	this is a pretty good camera , loaded with lots of features . the pros include the 10x optical zoom , use of sd card , and battery consumption . also , with this camera you have the ability to buy add-ons such as zoom lenses and such - makes it nice for those that are just past beginner experience . there are a couple of cons that i 've found , the most important being the picture quality . although it does have the capability to take great photos , you have to make sure and wait several seconds between shots to ensure that they 'll come out looking great ( in my opinion , anyway ) . the size is okay , although it is kinda bulky for being so small . i prefer something that size to also be slim - it 's not so easy to carry around because of this . overall , this camera is very easy to use
1	hi have a rebel extreme , and needed to use the high-speed mode ... but the flash could n't even vaguely keep up . i was taking pictures of dancers , so needed a flash system that could keep up . the speedlite really does this perfectly - i 'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos , and this flash system is there each time . i do n't know if it really helps when taking a single photo , but if you want a flash that can keep up , this one is great ! i like it so much , i 'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot , to run in slave mode with this one .
1	i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera . i have had all types of cameras over the years , mostly 35mm film canon slr 's . i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love , slr 's . i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i ca n't keep my hands off of it . it lacks nothing . although the kit lense is good , i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo 's with it . i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus , i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture . i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now do n't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a `` wonderful '' new feature like `` low light or non-shake . '' this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you ca n't outgrow it . its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be , it wo n't hold you back . the battery life is great , the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that 's even better . i never figure i 'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr 's and now feel that i have an old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you ca n't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...
1	got this camera because a friend had a similar one . the blue tooth feature is just great . you need a memory card to make if you want to take video 's and store a lot of photos . the video 's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size . all in all a great buy
0	i bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the smartmedia ( which only lasts for about a month ) . i would have to say that i am extremely disappointed , particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges . even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it 's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious , especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer . so blurry that i had to use photoshop to crop out the left and right sides . the right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one with a bad lens . in any case , no thanks , i 'll stick with my trusty old camera . i would rather pay for a new smartmedia card each month .
1	the picture is fine at this price . i bought the panasonic vdr-d100 for my daughter because she usually does n't want to do anything with the computer like edit video . when we gave it to her the first thing she asked was , `` can i edit the movies ? '' i did a quick test to make sure the dvds would finalize and work on another dvd player with success on 3 computers and 3 dvd players . i did n't find anything the disc would n't play on . then i started up vegas movie studio platinum which i use to edit my minidv movies . i selected import from dvd and it went straight to the minidvd and loaded in the files where i was able to edit and add titles , music , sound effects and a voice over if i wanted to . since i already bought dvd-r/w discs she will be able to reuse them if she ever edits the movies because you can unfinalize the discs and reformat them .
0	the camera worked perfectly for one week and then stopped working permanently . i just sent it off for repairs and have not received a diagnosis as to the root of the problem
1	the quality is definitely great . when attached to the s3 is , it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots . if you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography , i suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood
1	i do n't have that much stuff , but fits all my dslr gadgets plus my camcorder . fits - my canon xti with my canon 50 mm attached . - my kit lens - my new canon 70-300 is - my panasonic video cam - minor accessories ( extra batteries , cables , memory cards , etc ) there are separators with velcros inside , so you can configure the bag however you want it . the only issue i have with this bag is that i wa n't able to configure it to store my xti with my 70-300 attached
1	it seems surprising that canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials . lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver
0	i was down in antarctica when i turned on the camera and it said `` lens error '' . after a day of missing some of the best pictures of emperor penguins with my 8800 , i twisted the lens and got it to work . the same thing happened to me in bolivia , just after the warranty expired . i called nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera . do a google search of `` lens error '' and nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience . this is my third and last nikon
0	got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during christmas 2005 . camera is easy to use and takes good pictures . easily interfaces with pc through usb . however , i also ( as did another reviewer ) started having problems after about 11 months . camera would not take pictures as the ccd went bad . luckily i had an extended service contract and it was repaired . unfortunately , it just quit working again ( april 2007 ) and the service contract company says they `` ... wo n't bother fixing it again ... '' and is refunding my purchase price . gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time . good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract
1	i have a canon eos rebel which takes fantastic pictures . i use it around home and when i am setting up static shots such as family portraits . the only problem is ... who wants to lug it around to take snapshots . despite some of the above opinions about lack of sharpness , i have had no such problems . the 5900 is great for `` grab '' shots and it 's not too shabby for setting up a planned shot using it 's advanced controls . be sure that you buy a fast memory card . this will reduce the time between shots . as in most cameras , a memory card is not supplied with the camera . mr. goyal 's review about not being able to take pictures without a memory card is not true . you can take a limited number of shots with the internal memeory . the only real problem i have is the red-eye reduction feature . i usually turn it off as the delay between the `` red-eye '' flash and the main flash is too long . the subjects often think the shot is over and start to move . anyway it is easy enough to remove it later , either with photo-software or with the photo kisok in the drug store
1	images from this camera are very high quality . the 18x optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes . the optical image stabilization system ( based on stabilizing the ccd image sensor instead of lens elements ) is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances ( moving car , boat , shaky hands ) . my main gripe with this camera is the lack of high speed usb 2.0 support . the fine print says that the usb interface is `` full speed '' which means a maximum transfer rate of 12 mbit/s instead of the 480 mbit/s possible with high speed usb . so , downloading photos from the camera through the usb interface is painfully slow compared to most current generation digital cameras such as a canon sd900 . the software provided with the camera is somewhat difficult to use and is slow and unresponsive . it would also be desirable if the camera could accept a lithium ion rechargeable battery in addition or instead of the 4 aa batteries it uses . but , battery life with both alkaline and rechargeable nimh aa batteries was adequate .
1	i am a female bowhunter who really had trouble judjing distances on green fields . this is a great product . it is easy to use and very accurate
0	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame . i returned it
1	what a great little accessory for my camera . could have used it in seattle last month , boy did it rain
0	i was very happy with the previous model dsc-n1 , which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting . but this one , while i only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather , it really disappointed me . the pictures are always blured due to too much exposure , i used auto flash , for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1mp ! i 'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible i will return it , i just ca n't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes . i doubt i was unlucky and got a bad one , i ca n't believe a 10.1mp sony camera takes so poor pictures . and after reading the previous review about the terrible sony custmer servce , i decide i will avoid sony customer service , and the camera will just be returned . note : found the review by cecelia choy `` cece '' on march 13 , 2007 mentioned the same problem i had . i did n't have this problem with my previous model dsc-n1 . april 17 , 2006 : i bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now ! suggestion for those having the same problem i had before -- exchange for another one ! !
0	i made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely . the lens is for a variety of canon cameras but the adapter only works with the a6xx series . my adapter arrived and it does n't work with my camera . kinda misleading and now i have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately . bummer . also , captain jack is correct about the vignetting . this lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens . if you zoom wide angle , you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned . if you stay zoomed in , it works ok . disappointing
0	to customer before me , you camera d200 might be on recall . please check the nikon website for more info . you have described the exact recall problem . good luck ! btw , have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 ? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200 .
1	i have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the canon 20d now , what a pleasure to shot . the battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots , which should be sufficient for most anybody . there is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera . the lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers . for those individuals who are on the fence about this product i tout it to all i have spoken to . it turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot , it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash . the built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time . the delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package
0	i would agree with the other review . the indoor/low light quality of the video is unacceptable . i will be returning the camcorder today to purchase another
1	i 've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it 's been a tried and true companion . i 've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs . the features that really set this camera apart are the 12x zoom , the image stabilization ( a must with such a large zoom ) , and the rotating screen ( great if you want to take a picture of yourself : ) ) . i also love the macro mode , i 've gotten some great quality close-ups . for most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results , but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well . performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife , sports , landscape , beach , etc . my only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations . pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond , sometimes not responding at all . also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular aa batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting ( around 200 pictures ) or less if i was shooting in cold weather . i would definately recommend rechargable batteries . overall i 've really enjoyed this camera . i 've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations ( which i was rarely in anyway ) it never let me down . both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it
0	beware of assuming that the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct size . it was n't even close . no size was given for the lense diameter . i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping all the hassel of packaging it
1	i 've had a ton of these , and i take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields . i 've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud , taken it out , shot a few pics , put it back in the pocket with no problem . ( see pictures for examples of `` mud photos '' ) a couple of times i 've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off , but still had beautiful pictures every time , no jams or over-exposures . i 've found the two pack at walmart on sale for $ 8.99 a couple of times , and you absolutely can not be that deal . this is my favorite disposable camera , and i 've tried them all .
0	i bought this lens in may for my brand new rebel xt . i used it on a vacation mainly , and am pretty dissapointed . i 'm no pro , or even skilled amateur , but i do know the lens is not giving me quality shots . the autofocusing is slow , and af or manual shots are n't very sharp at any zoom . there seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me . i wanted a good , all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types . i guess this would fit the bill , if it took sharp pictures . i would n't pay more than $ 150 for this lens again
0	i was extremely disappointed with this product ; i felt very let down by sony , because for years i bought sony items with confidence , knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable . this item only goes to prove that sony 's standards have dropped and , as such i will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs . what lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up ; 2 metres ( not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping ) was the best i could do , and that was in a straight line . no , all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin
1	this rangefinder is great ! much lighter than the big bulky other units . has all the great features that is needed . this is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it 's too big . i tested this against some of my buddies ' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy . great scan mode . best buy . should be sold for about ( $ ) more than asked for
0	the camera feels slick . the software that comes with it gets a 4 star for efficiency , though the intuitiveness is not its strength . while the large lcd display is terrific ( the main reason i got it ) , it is worthless in a high glare situation . you ca n't see what you are shooting . it 's worthless ! and since nikon did not give you a viewing lense for such situations , there are times whey you have no idea what you are shooting . while the viewing wheel , to rapidly cycle through the shots you 've taken , is quite handy , the rest of the navigation is less than intuitive , and often takes so long to figure out that you give up . pictures are generally good , though the conditions have to be perfect , or you get grain or blur . there is one lovely feature , but it is only useful on a tri-pod . it is a function which allows you to take a flash photo and have the aperture remain open for a little while after to fill in the background . it creates flash shots without the black void background typical of such pix . i use that feature a lot , but its worthless without `` legs '' for the camera . i bought this on a whim , counting on the nikon reputation . had i known , i would have stuck with the canon
0	it 's only redeemingly quality is the price ( if you get a good deal ) . photo quality is poor , and screen is quite small ( 3x5 ) . navigation is not overly complicated , but buttons must be pushed hard to work . it did work perfectly fine - took sd card , even connected to my mac and drag and drop photos onto the sd card i inserted into the frame . but , because of the poor quality of the photos , i do n't suggest buying
0	i 'm giving this a 2 stars only because my daughter also had this camera on her wish list . if not i would of been upset having recieved the wrong camera that i ordered ... ... ...
0	i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography . i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion . if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them
1	after a week of testing this camcorder , i found it good enough for daily use . the hd2 does not come with an sd card , so make sure you buy one before or at the time you get the hd2 . i got a 2gb sd a-data and a 4gb sdhc qpi class6 . both worked fine . the 4gb gives me about 1:20h in standardhd mode , and 55mns in superhd mode . i did n't notice a speed difference between a class2 and a class6 sd card using the hd2 , i think you should be fine with an 8gb sdhc class2 . my first impression of the camera is how small it is , however it may not fit in a jean pocket . it turns on very quick , you can start filming within 2secs of startup . it has a lady voice telling the mode you are using ( ie camera mode ) , not sure if this is useful for others , but not for me . the video and still pictures are great outdoor . the video quality is impressive during a bright sunlight . in a room lighten by a 60w equivalent fluo light , the video quality is grainy/noisy , this has been confirmed by other people as well . the high sensitivity feature ( to boost the image quality at low light ) helps but not enough . my 7yrs old sony digital8 does a better job at 1lux . i noticed that video quality is grainy at low light , but 7mp still picture quality is very good for the same lighting . compared to my new canon sd800 at 7mp , it is obvious the canon digital camera wins . on the video side , i played with several configuration , iso setting , white balance , resolution , etc ... it does helps , but the video is still grainy at low light . this camcorder has not been designed for low light filming . i ran into an issue when transfering the video pictures from the hd2 with its cradle to the pc via usb connection . i got errors transfering the files if you use the craddle ( this will freeze the hd2 ) . i am not sure why , i have to check with sanyo on this . if you connect the hd2 directly to the pc ( without the cradle ) , the transfer goes smooth . so there is an issue with the cradle and usb port . i am also using pinnacle studio 10.5 for my video editing . so far , i have not been able to use it and control my hd2 . you can however copy the files from sd to your pc , and use these files with pinnacle studio . since i film most of the time outdoor during daytime , this camera does the job fine and video quality is great . i would still give a 5 stars even with the video issues at low light .
1	i bought one of these for my canon sd-800 and can recommend it . for many years now , i 've carried canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose . my only criticism of the canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media . i was hoping that with the tiny size of sd cards canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases , but they have n't . on the plus side , the case retains the superior leather construction , uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of velcro or a snap , and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body . the package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera . incidentally , the sd-800 is well matched to the case , fitting quite securely
0	this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $ 88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .
1	i recently purchased this camera . it arrived one day before i was due to fly out to palm springs . i took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures . this may or may not be because i am a novice photographer . even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry , but all others came out better than i ever expected . i think once i play around with it , my night time pictures will improve , but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me . no regrets with this purchase though . also , buy a larger memory stick . the one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and i had to run out and buy another .
0	i only wish i had read the previous review before i bought this item . i too was trying to convert my hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass-through on my sony minidv handycam . i bought this way-too-expensive cable , mostly because it was the only option available . it seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low-end disk drive or graphics card , considering the technology involved in those devices . but my real problem is with the failure of sony to reveal that the s-video connection is useless for input . this information is nowhere on the package , nor is it on their website . there is a notice saying `` please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase '' . you ca n't read that warning when buying online , and if buying at a store , there 's no way to know what 's compatible because they do n't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package . i guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website , then come back to the store and buy it , instead of just buying it and seeing if it works . there is a section of the handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one , however they fail to mention that the sony cable wo n't work , despite the premium price they charge . if the problem is that they could n't make it work with both a composite and s-video cable , then they should have just made it work for s-video , since a composite cable comes with the camera . shame on you , sony , for adding a little aggravation to my day , and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard . it 's enough to make me want to buy a canon camcorder ( i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i do n't want to submit to proprietary sony standards like memorystick ) . rant over .
1	i am in love with this camera . the shutterspeed is awesome , the quality of pictures is awesome , and the shake reduction feature is awesome ! ! i would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great camera !
0	i gave this picture frame to my wife for a christmas gift , we pluged it in and within a half an hour it made a loud bang and smoke poured out of the thing like crazy ... .not a good gift .
0	unfortunately i had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a mac 10.4 program ( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a mac .
1	i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 , but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned . really nice camera . has a nice dslr type feel . 71 % of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 , ( as of today ) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20 . buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon . you can do a lot with 5 megapixels . i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr
1	case is pretty much what you see ... i have no complaints . = ) the case protects my camera very well
1	i got a nikon laser rangefinder for chrisymas and it had an 8x magnification . i found this to be to powerful for golf.i could not hold it steady on the flag.the 6x magnification on the bushnell yardage pro scout was much better . also it is very compact and stores easily in my golf cart . the price from amazon was well below i could find anywhere else .
0	in the past , i have considered amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites . to be perfectly honest , i am no longer sure . two months ago , i bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on amazon . this camera set was called the 1 gb stylus 720 sw kit . ironically , the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 gb cards ! my first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories . two weeks after receiving the kit , i emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake . after waiting a few weeks for a response , i decided to send them a second email . again , no response . by this point , i felt helpless and turned to amazon for aid . surprisingly , amazon was not much better than 47th st photo . minutes after sending the email to amazon , i received an automatic email informing me that amazon had received my email . that was the last i heard from amazon . more than two months have passed and i have not heard from either company
0	after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g . use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) .
1	i purchased this tripod from 47th street photo through amazon.com . the tripod appeared to arrive in good shape , except that the operating instructions were not included . i immediately emailed 47th stree photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment . i asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions . they did not respond to my email , so a few days later i emailed them again . once again , no response . i then emailed amazon.com , and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th street photo . no response from amazon either ! as far as the tripod goes , it appears to be a very good value for the money . i gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because , due to the missing operating instructions , i can not be certain i have properly checked out all of its features . however , i am certain that both 47th street photo and amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service . i will use neither one again
1	this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer . basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash . it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage . when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed . the white box is for general use . also available are the green omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni-bounce for a warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution for better flash photography . a quality product that works . cons : non
0	after being an amature photographer via print film , i decided to try a digital camera - though i 've been leary about printing quality . i knew i could n't afford a digital slr , so i opted for a `` snap shot '' camera that i thought would have enough features to satisfy me . however , after having and using this camera for a year now , i am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much , its a washout . after being used to print and picture quality in my film slr ( cannon , i might add ) , i was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera , i wish i would have just saved my money for a digital slr .
1	my husband is away ( military ) and i was looking for the perfect , small but clear , pictures for him . i did n't care about the frame , only the small white digital system . i was hesitant , as my mil has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible . i was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an sd card and transferring pictures from the computer . i love that i can use either batteries or the included plug . everything was soooo easy that i did not even need to read the instructions to begin . i also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later . this is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable . perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are ! then , when he comes home , it 's great for a portable album to carry anywhere
1	i can not help but giggle when i saw comments like `` great lens for the money '' . it is selling for $ 440 at here , even on so-called clearance . however , one can easily find the same lens at least $ 50 cheaper at some decent online camera store , such as b , ritz camera , etc . sad amazon..
0	as i have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult , as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus . i thought this might be a solution . this eyecup fails on all requards . worst feature , the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect . second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless . last it has the cheep feel of cracker jack plastic , well and the optics to match . now i know where olympus had it manufactured
0	i received this filter and it had been used , seals were open and case that holds filters cracked , piece of plastic floating loose inside , smug marks on it . i was shocked , i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this .
0	i bought this over the sony and i regret it . i get a tape eject error every time i try to rewind . i can only rewind at 10 second intervals before i get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again . that 's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape . many canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired . canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item . i will never buy canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem
0	i got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens . the solution might be useful , the blower is useful , the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips , but the so called `` magic cloth '' is anything but magic . it kept leaving lint on my lens
0	i was completely fooled . twice . my fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for christmas . so as i slowly open the box , i see a pair of socks on top . there was more underneath , so i start opening it further and there is a camera case , a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box , the hp photosmart m525 digital camera ! i was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own . no more borrowing from my sister when i needed to snap a few pictures . i put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures . to put it bluntly , ugh ! ! ! the first thing that i noticed is that , even in best picture mode , the pictures were a little blurry/grainy even in the best of lighting conditions . the second thing that i noticed is that the pictures are distorted . there 's a slight fisheye effect ( imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door . ) which is quite annoying . i talked to hp support ( someone who spoke very poor english i might add . what is the deal with that ? ) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model . guess what ? same problem ! so after talking to hp once again , i am returning this one and getting a different brand . this is a horrible product . my sisters kodak that i bought 3 years ago is a far superior product . i am very disappointed . hp needs to put out a better product , and have some customer support reps that speak better english . it gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood
0	i had high hopes for this battery for my nikon camera . it promised more mah than the oem battery that came with the camera . unfortunately , it must be leaking electrons all over the place , since a charge in this model does not compare to the original . i would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original nikon battery . the price was cheap and you get what you pay for . if you are going to purchase this one , get two since you 'll need to keep one charging while using the other . cheers
1	this case is great for the quick day outings . it is rugged and keeps the camera safe . my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky . everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead .
0	if you are looking to take high quality pictures , then look elsewhere . it is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you , but not much else . ( or for a beginner in photography or a child . ) you have to hold very still if you do n't want your pictures to come out blurry . also , the flash makes images far too bright and if you do n't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark . the only thing i like about this camera is it 's size . it 's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag ... anyway , i 'm buying a better one soon
1	the d300 is easy to use it takes great video outside , and is very good in low light . it also takes very good pictures , and the battery last a long time . i would buy it again
0	i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked . the older model is far superior . this camera is slow to focus , slow to shoot , and slow to save . i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition ( indoor , medium light ) on the automatic setting , all 5 pictures turned out different , only one turned out clear . i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with
0	when i was buying my husbands olympus camera this rechargeable battery popped up as a suggested purchase to go with camera so i ordered it . not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it i assumed it was compatable with the camera i was purchasing at that time . no it was not ! ! ! so i paid for and wraped ( christmas present ) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable . now i have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again ... not to mention the frustration of a return ! ! ! ! not a happy amazon shopper !
0	amazon picture shows an original japanese-produced np-40 with 3.7v and 710mah ( just like the one i got with my f810 ) . what i got was a fujifilm-branded chinese-produced np-40 with 3.6v and 750 mah . yes , it works , but it 's just obviously cheaper . skepticism is a virtue
0	i bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents . two of them stopped working . one of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped . unfortunately , out of the warranty period ! and inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored . i 'm out a lot of money for this garbage . do not waste your money on this garbage ! ! ! !
0	purchased this item in dec 06 ' screen burned out mar 07 ' . on top of that screen quality was not that great . do not order order this item
0	the battery which `` popped up '' with my camera order does not match the camera . thus i am stuck with the hassel of returning a battery . i was leaving for a trip when it arrived and so i had to go out and buy a replacement after it arrived .
0	i ordered the original item , used it for about a week , then sent it to my son in new hampshire . he used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up , never to function properly again . i ordered a replacement , checked it out and sent it on to him , with the same result -- less than 15 minutes of use , it quit working . i thought the unit was nice , compact and fairly easy to use , but with two malfunctions in two cameras , i do n't think i would recommend this aiptek model to anyone
1	i purchased this prior to the birth of my son , and it 's doing the job perfectly . i do n't have a 2.4ghz phone at home so i ca n't say how it would 've affected its performance , but video and sound are very clear at a remote location . i 'm happy with the product and highly recommend it
0	there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . `` if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . '' read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !
0	i bought this lens for my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find . i knew going in that this lens was n't perfect but , was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens . i liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization . i shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed . the pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull . i thought it might have been my new camera at first because i could n't imagine the quality would be this bad . i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i had for my canon film slr and the results were much better . for the digital focal length though , my old lens would n't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor . later , i decided on the tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews . the salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when i told him i had this canon lens . he said , `` let me guess , you 'd like to try the tamron 17-50/2.8 . '' he said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it . i could return it with no questions asked if i was n't satisfied . he also said that he had n't had one person return it yet . my first images with this lens were great . they were sharp and had way more vibrant color . there is absolutely no comparison at all . i was hesitant to buy a third party lens but , my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results . this is the first review i have ever posted on amazon . i was so dissapointed that i wanted to help others not make the same mistake . after spending $ $ $ on a digital slr , it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens . before taking a chance on buying the canon , do yourself a big favor and try the canon and tamron at a local store .
1	the changer performs perfectly . i was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget . the only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original , about one foot shorter . other than that , it is fine . i gave my original changer to my daughter , whose charger died just before leaving the country
0	they tell you tha this product holds 6aa batteries , and works with the 20d 's battery grip , but when i received the item it is for a completely different product and does not work with the 20d 's bg-e2 grip . it has the product name of cpm-e3 , just as stated ... but it accepts 8 aaa batteries and does n't even come close to working with the bg-e2 .
1	excellent product for the price . pictures are not that good , but you ca n't ask more for this price
1	not too hard and not too soft . camera fits nicely , with compartments for just about anything you need for your camera .
1	i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera . i have had all types of cameras over the years , mostly 35mm film canon slr 's . i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love , slr 's . i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i ca n't keep my hands off of it . it lacks nothing . although the kit lense is good , i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo 's with it . i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus , i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture . i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now do n't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a `` wonderful '' new feature like `` low light or non-shake . '' this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you ca n't outgrow it . its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be , it wo n't hold you back . the battery life is great , the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that 's even better . i never figure i 'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr 's and now feel that i have an old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you ca n't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...
1	this is my second digital camera . although it does so much more than my first , it is much easier to operate . i especially love the fact that i can video my grandson 's baseball game , and then convert individule frames to photos ( jpeg ) with great quality . i have a series of photos with him getting a hit . it looks great ! thanks for a great product . ralp
1	i had been searching web site after web site for a system like this . i finally found a site where i could purchase seperate parts for a comparable system . however , the receivers alone were more than this unit ( if you wanted a receiver compatible with a plasma ) . this works great . could not be easier to install . all components are in my basement . i ran the eye through the wall and have the eye barely exposed through a single cable face plate , with the blue led light taped to the back of the plate . the blue light still shines through the faceplate , which is perfect . the faceplate is just below my wall mounted plasma set . no interference . this set up allows me to use this system at just about any angle in the room and the adjacent kitchen . works great with a basic $ 20 all in one ir remote . also , the customer service is like no other . i had several questions and each e-mail was answered by the next day with great help . made this purchase a no brainer . this is one product that far exceeded my expectations even after reading all the great reviews . i highly recomend this product .
0	the adorama silica gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it . i emailed customer service at adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond . i ca n't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready . what color should it be and what color should indicate recharging . how to i recharge it ? nothing tells me how to recharge it . so far , money wasted . unresponsive to my emails
0	this camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to pc via usb . however , the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus , which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion . the clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation . we returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect , but the second unit had the same problem . apparently , according to the manual , this is `` not a malfunction ''
0	i agree with reviewer steve - anything less than a few hundred feet and these binocs are worthless . the paper works says the `` may '' focus down to 35 ' . maybe some will but not certainly not my pair . i am returning them since they are not good for simple viewing around the yard . and no , the rubber eye caps absolutely will not stay back making these binocs almost unusable by people with glasses ( like me ) . scot
1	for years now i have been buying `` bargain '' cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one . finally , i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex-z600 . this camera is awesome . the screen is huge , the picture quality is great , it is easy to use and is sooo small . overall , a great buy . the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock . luckily , i have an sd card reader , so i normally just use that to download my pictures
1	the nikon s3 has proven to be a good buy . it is affordable yet takes a quality photo . in addition this camera is easy to use and fits conveniently in a pocket . this camera has the ranging ability to take both a simple aim and shoot photo , and at the same time complex skill shots that is complemented by computer editing and redeye reduction . my only complaint is as a result of the user . if the camera does not have time to focus , then the picture quality suffers immensely . this camera has only been in use for about two months but has not let me down yet ! my rating : 9/10
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads `` panasonic '' , not `` lumix '' . fits the camera perfectly . no extra room for memory cards , spare battery , charger , etc . it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down . the belt loop wo n't fit most belts . no straps . however , the camera 's strap is good enough . good protection
1	it lasts a lot of shots , about 1000 shots , it 's amazing , with two of these batteries you have for almost a month in holiday without any recharge
1	this lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality . it compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk . might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul .
1	this is a really nice compact camera from canon . the picture quality is excellent . i have tried some night/day shots and the pictures are great . the zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for . the build quality is excellent and i really love the 3 '' display . i find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it . the camera is very compact but i never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand . the images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp . i would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original canon battery and its available on amazon . the accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original canon parts especially the extra battery . also get a sd card with large enough memory . what comes with the camera ( 32mb ) is really a waste . still do n't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card . but overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results
0	hello all , lens hoods are pretty much a necessity , but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i 've ever used . unlike other hoods that screw on , this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one , and release the clips . this leads to problems of alignment , meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right . although it 's a pain and i hate ... i do n't really have another alternative . either go w/o a hood , or take this one . either way , guess i 'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one
0	if you like to take pictures with macro lense , it sucks . i 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality . if you get closer than five inches , the pictures messes up . i 've had no other problem with the hardware , though i hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger . no other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! so loose it and you 're screwed . oh , and night photos also suck . big time , even with the flash on
0	this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it does n't seem to fit my mark ii body properly .
0	pros : great resolution . nice packaging . excellent door stop . cons : stopped working after 3 weeks . horrible overall quality . no customer support what so ever since i did n't have a receipt ( ebay purchase ) . tried contacting the ebay seller for receipt , never got a response now i 'm stuck with a 360 dollar dead weight . tried contacting pacificdigital they offered a none warranty repair for $ 199 . becareful what you purchase on ebay specially pacificdigital products .
1	i purchased this lens for my canon eos 20d digital camera and so far i really like it . it focuses fast and produces very sharp , clear images . as with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake ; i 've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots . i really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots . the lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed , which is typical for canon products . for the price range , this is an excellent lens . you can only do better by spending considerable more money on an is lens
1	do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras ( ie the 20d , 30d , rebels etc ) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception . i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already . great lens , great color , so well built , super sharp , just watch out if this is your first l lens , you 'll be hooked . this is a lens you will have for many years , great investment
0	the noise problem with this camera is horrendous . do not buy it ! if you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly ... never . no matter how hard you try . my 3-year old 5mpx sony is much better than this panasonic camera . i am sorry i bought it . i would return this product if i could and buy a good camera instead . the lumix dmc-lx2 camera can not focus one bit , many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem . even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred . noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily . you can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness , noise reduction , contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem . the amazon website says you can use standard sd memory which is untrue ( perhaps this has been corrected now ) . the camera only accepts more expensive sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . these sdhc cards can not be read by standard memory stick readers so i have to use the usb port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer .
1	pros : - reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light . - helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches . - somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall . better to break the hood than the front element . - makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you . cons : - will increase lens movement in windy situations , kind of like a sail on a boat . - takes up more room in your bag , even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens . - people take more notice of you , will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile
0	i had just recently bought this camera , and it was ok. the quaility of the pictures was pretty ok. i couldnt really understand it , and what really stinks is that i lost the stupid cd that comes with it and now i cant install it . overall i would say that the camera is a stinky peice of junk . now im begging my parent to buy me a reall digital camera ! ! not a peice of crap .
1	purchased a printer dock and camera bundle , from a local office supply store for $ 100 . it only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge , so i purchsed this from amazon . amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping . it works great . no complaints . the paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that i still use for some pictures , but works well for my classroom , to give to my students . the pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them
1	very small and easy to carry . neat on the zoom , a bit hazy on the image stabilization but overall a good buy for the buck
0	i purchased this for my 4 year old son because he loves to take pictures . i did n't want to spend a lot of money , however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use . not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working . however , when it did work every single picture was blurry . there is only one button for every option and it is very confusing . i would n't recommend this product to anyone . it is being returned
1	i have the sony battery that came with the camera and bought an additional sony battery that allowed for 2-4 hours . however , i wanted a battery that i could count on for the better part of an `` all day '' event and i found it in the qm91d . i was asked to photograph a wedding from getting ready ( hair dresser at 0830 , until the end of the reception at 11:30pm ) the qm91d held strong . i did not constantly video tape , but with my digital recorder i had 6 sony 120 tapes ( 60 min digital ) -- 5 were captured using the qm91d . i did switch some of the tapes before they were completely used to make sure i did n't miss important events ... so i never actually used up `` all '' of the qm91d battery . this battery was used again during the evacuation from houston ( secondary to hurricane rita ) -- i used it entirely and it did not faulter ... it lasted throughout the trip and i had no need to change to the smaller batteries . the size of the battery did not really bother me -- i was aware that it would be larger than the others and it did not hamper the use of the camera . read the manufacturer information on battery life , charging time etc ... for this battery it is valid . i would recommend this battery .
1	easy to learn , takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you do need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities are n't that great . very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash , though , and there 's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken ( not so great for fast action shots , even though it touts a `` sports '' mode ) . it 's a good beginner 's camera , a good pocket-style camera , but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit .
0	i lost my hp r607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly . i could n't fine another r607 ( which i really liked ) , so i purchased the hp m407 . i thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera ... not ! ! i do n't like anything about this camera ... it 's terrible ! you can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries , about 10 with rechargeable ones ( even with screen off ) . it says `` auto focus '' , but i do n't think it has any focus at all ... .not far away , not close up , nothing ! it takes a really looooooooong time to actually take the picture after you press the button . i really hate it ! keep looking ... do n't buy this camera
1	this camera is a steal . the reviews on amazon helped me decide on this camera and sure it is worth it .
0	i found the same problem that other users of this product experienced . particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot . i found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash . this leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated `` flipping '' of the flash that some other users have reported . the item is manufactured by stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called `` gadget infinity '' under the listing title of `` flash bracket with 90 degrees camera rotate feature '' . buy it now price is $ 29.99 . i just bought one and it arrived yesterday and i could not be happier . pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years
1	i just bought a digital rebel about a month ago . love the camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates with the camera but just does n't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the rebel . this flash does the job for the rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab that item . another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash , is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital rebel lacks . when this flash is mounted on your digital rebel , you do n't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash . the rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550ex to focus the lens ; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs . the flash has tons of features that most of us might never use , but as a advanced amateur i 'm glad they 're there so i can play with that if i should choose to try out some fancy stuff . the wireless slave capability is handy but you 've got to have at least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex to use that . i like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head , it 's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up/down -- -this should make the head sturdier than i 've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts . this unit is a honker -- really big , and , no lightweight either . get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you . what 's the difference between this and the 580ex ? the 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , for me anyway it was n't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580 . all of the newer eos camera bodies are fully supported by this unit , it also works on older eos bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that are n't there on older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use . when you get yours do n't lose that book , canon does n't seem to have them online anywhere i can find and i 've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one
1	my bother-in-law and i went to africa on safari last year . we had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting . the optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states . our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt . they were so impressed by the is and price that we left a pair with our hunter . he used them for the entire season last year , and when he visited `` the states '' last month , he reported that they are still doing well
0	i loved this camera when i received it and used it a couple of times . then , it just stopped working . i have since purchased the same camera elsewhere and it is works great . maybe this was just a bad egg . good camera , but 2 months of use for the money was n't good
1	i have taught photography at the college level , shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion , and am very demanding about image quality . i am quite satisfied with the image quality from my kodak p880 , particularly after i installed the newest firmware upgrade available from kodak . i went through several 7mp to 8 mp cameras before finally getting the kodak p880 . the p880 has better image quality than some high end sonys and olympus 7-8 mp cameras like the dsc-v3 or the sp350 . i tested the p880 against the even higher end 10.3 mp large sensor sony r1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the p880 and the r1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction , which the p880 images accept particularly well . the zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range . balance , manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs . the camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in raw format and exposure bracketing modes but that really does n't bother me because i do mostly landscape and fine art photos . raw file format is directly supported by most versions of adobe photoshop and photoshop elements as well as most other raw processing programs like bibble pro . unlike most sub- $ 500 cameras , the p880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters , a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe . manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well . the direct mechanical zoom is also nice . overall , the p880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot slr-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film slr . although not small enough to slip in a pocket , the size is still reasonable and light
0	this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter , it produces flare in the picture . furthermore , after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9 % light loss vs multi-coated filters like hoya s-hmc or b+w mrc filters . as for polarizer effect itself , i think it 's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day . ( the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally . but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you ca n't even tell what you have taken . if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did , on this useless piece of crap
1	i deal in major brand cameras and panasonic cameras are my personal favorite ! i 've seen people whine about the `` noise '' they make many times but have never found it to be a problem . i own the fz10 and the fx01 for my personal cameras . the fx01 is a very fast camera and takes great pics ! i love the 28mm wide lens . compared to most cameras i 've used the fx01 does a real good job of metering the light and exposing the images . i love panasonic 's solid build and reliability . they may not be as popular as canon or sony but in my opinion are every bit as good .
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera . the camera does not come close to fitting in this case . the camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case .
1	i just bought this waterproof case in order to use my canon s410 on a scuba diving trip . i was a little nervous at first ( i could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone ! ) , but i have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably ! i used it on 6 dives , and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet . i did not have one leak ! a word of caution -- i followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel ( just a small amount ) . i would like to think that the camera would not leak without this , but i did not want to take any chances . i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach
0	i ordered this tripod , and it arrived broken . the assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic . i asked for an rma order via e-mail , and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice . ' being lazy about mailing things back , and since it was cheap to begin with i tried repair it myself . where it broke ( the three plastic rings on the camera mount ) , it was impossible to re-glue , because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure . even if your tripod arrives un-broken , it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all .
0	i 'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures . the p3 was the fourth point and shoot nikon camera my family has owned . one of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it . on the p3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on . i accidently dropped it from about 30 '' off the ground when it was only a few days old . it landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens . the outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus . i sent it back to nikon and as i expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty . they charged $ 162.50 to fix it . mastercard has a program called `` purchase assurance '' that will hopefully cover the repair cost ! the other night i saw a commercial on tv for an olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet , get wet , or even frozen down to 14 degrees f and still take pictures . i wish i had seen that ad first . the nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera . not buying nikon anymore .
0	i bought this item over a year ago , and it has never served for anything . once i spotted a deer and turned on the `` ir '' illuminator , and the deer ran away - not too surprising , it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals . better use a flashlight . this is a first-generation nightscope , and has a very small range of utility : if there is a little light , the adapted human eye sees better , and if there is almost no light the device does not see either . 100 bucks is not too much of a waste , but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much
1	i had this camera for 6 months and so far there have been no problems . the only flaw is that it dosent have a long battery time . it takes good pictures and short videos
1	this is a fabulous and reliable camera . feels solid . fantastic pictures . easy to operate . a new d40 has been announced over the past few days , but its lack of an lcd display and buttons to manage basic camera controls ( to reduce weight and make it more user friendly ) would still make this my recommended nikon dslr . expect prices to fall as the d40 becomes available
0	i purchased this wide angle lens for my digital camera . when i was experimenting with it taking photos inside my house , there was a dark shadow in the lower right hand portion of the photo . when i took a photo outside , there was no shadow . i went to my local camera shop to ask for help in this matter and he said i would need to adjust the white balance according to the light in the room , but he said , in reality , 'these digital cameras are really not meant for attachments ' . i did experiment with the light balance , but still had no luck in getting that dark area to disappear.the flash on the camera is not strong enough to compensate for the area the lens blocks . i returned the product .
1	the casio exilim ex-s770rd is a great camera for the price . camera is the smallest on the market and will fit in any pocket . lcd sreen is large and very clear . 7.2 mp produces great picture quality and the functions are easily accessed . as this is my first casio purchase , i am very pleased with the quality
1	when the etx-90pe works , it works very well and makes astronmomy an easy hobby to get into . let me elaborate . first , the best telescope is the one you use most often . all too frequently people buy big telescopes that are heavy to carry , and that need frequent adjustment . the little etx weighs less than 20 lbs all set up ( including tripod ) , and never needs adjustment . it encourages frequent use . second , one of the most challenging aspects of astronomy , especially for the newcomer , is finding objects to look at . if you are not familiar with the night sky and where things are located , it can get very frustrating spending up to 30 minutes just to find one object to look at ! the etx 's built in computer makes finding objects easy - just select what you want to see from a menu , and the scope will automatically point to it . the optical quality of the etx is excellent . the manufacturer , meade , does a very good job of turning out optical systems that rank with the best . some of the most rewarding objects - the moon , jupiter , saturn , and the orion nebula look wonderful through this telescope . one final positive to mention is the ease of setup . the pe models are the easiest of all telescope to get up and running . just turn on the power , press one key on the hand held computer controller , and in a few moments the telescope will start aligning itself so that it will automtically find objects for you . you do n't need to worry about where north is , or what the current date , time , and location are . now some cautions . first , the etx-90 is a small telescope , and will not show as much as a larger one . that is the trade-off with getting a portable instrument . there are larger etx models that are almost as portable , so these might be a consideration . also , understand that there will be a learning curve when using the built in computer . it 's not hard , but you need to have some patience while you learn the procedure . finally , be prepared for some quality control issues . as good as the optics are , some etx 's have some mechanical problems that require a return to the factory for warranty repair . my own etx-90pe had to go back to the factory twice . but once all the problems were fixed , it was well worth it ! on this note , you can purchase an extended warranty from the manufacturer at a reasonable price , and i would recommend doing so
1	i honestly do n't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars . the moment i got it , i was delighted with the quality of the pictures ( except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star ) , and by its portability . i 've dropped it , abused it , took it to countless parties , countries and it is now full of scratches and bumps ( get the camera case ! ) , and guess what : it still works as perfectly as the first day i got it . this little piece of technology is amazing , so if you 're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality ( for us amateurs , of course ) just go for it . actually , i even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it . i even love it and rely on it so much that i wo n't change it even now that it looks all messed up . do n't think twice . just go for it
0	the documentation is terrible . its going to take a lot of practice . if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine . however i want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x sb600s . just setting the d200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the sb800/masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail , in the manual . the sb800 is designed for this purpose . so why not include information on how to do this ?
1	this filter is a must have for photographers that care about their gear . it remains a cost effective tool for protecting the camera lens while serving as a great every day filter .
0	the camera operates good , but i thought it was suppose to be new . it looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom . it does work , but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out
0	i ordered the camera case for the canon digital elph 450 . and i was given a completely different one . prices sound great , but they do not deliver what you buy . had a bad experience with them .
1	this lens does ok at magnifying about 2x max . on full zoom , the magnification was not as sharp as without the close-up lens
1	this is a wonderful lens with great image quality , very fast , and very good build quality . no complaints
1	it is a great camera , very small and gives very good photos in most circumstances . grainy pic in dim light . go to the casio website to download the new firmware for 4gb sd card compatibility . you will get over 1500 high res photos with a 4 gb card , where outpost is selling for 5o dollars a car
0	i was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood . given that the cost is about 10 % of the cost of the lens for which it was intended ( the 70-300 is in this case ) i expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate . -positives- fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare , etc . the bayonet locking system is excellent , much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods . that 's about it . -negatives- the polycarbonate is so thin i half expect it to be translucent . the hood must be gripped by the base to remove it , as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it ; or at least it feels like it may break it . its very long . especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens , this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long . that 's pretty conspicuous . it 's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ( $ 50 vs. $ 5-10 for rubber or metal ) . i traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood . 2 stars for the great bayonet design , but the rest of it is weak
1	after way too much time infront of a pc reading reviews or a camera store counter ( damn i was sick of it ) , this d80 is what i chose . bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip west . after draging it everywhere i has not let me down . for the price its perfect . i 'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head ) at work i have a rebel xt i bought last year as i need its compact casing . my brother has the canon d30 after he progressed from the xt and a friend on the west coast has the d200 . having experience both i still love what i chose . my biggest reason however for going again with nikon was that i already have a n6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was i could use its nikkor af 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options . after reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop i found it worked fine . experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens . the 2.5 inch lcd is sooo much easier to read than the rebel xt . the info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the lcd on the xt ( if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and i ca n't see through the viewfinder myself , i certainly ca n't see the info screen if its below it ) . i did n't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me . i got a great deal for the same price at cameraland in new hampshire for the d80 and the ( d70s ) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens . fab . now need to save up and wait for the release of the 80-300 vr lens thats coming out . would love the 80-400 vr but its 3 times the price . my hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock , at a price i wanted to pay , the set up i wanted and who was n't trying to make a dodgie deal ( like some of those cheap web based places in nyc ) .it really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end . i was surprised . many people were almost reluctant to make a sale . it was wierd . parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either . anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera . i hope it takes many great pictures for you .
0	i read other review , and decided to give it a try . as soon as i recieve it in the mail , and opened the box , i realized this was a mistake . cheap quality binocular with `` high power '' being a selling point . it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place ! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation . you will be constantly ajdusting the focus . your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors are all cheap crap , and annoying to have it all on~ ! i am taking this back , and buying made in japan `` nikon eagle view '' 100 times better . you get what you pay for~ ! ! ! ! !
1	i bought this camera for my 16 year old granddaughter and she just loves it . the pics are bright and clear and the camera is very easy to handle
1	camera arrived earlier than i expected , and was just what i wanted . very small , but versitle . large screen . very satified with my purchase
1	it is simple , handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera . but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks ... this wired release would be the choice only if you are not a digital rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button .
0	almost useless ! tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration . went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier . professional medical photographer
1	good product , probably the best digital frame in the market . drawbacks are the user interface and the difficulty to set-up the wireless connection
1	it 's a 72mm lens hood , no vigneting , works great . a must for using ef28-135 outdoors
0	good : motor drive speed . grip feel . takes nikon lenses . reacts fast to pressing the shutter release . bad : skin tone renditions a color other than skin . white balance does n't balance well . noise at anything above iso 200 , looks like 3200 . cf card door tough to open . screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot . battery cover is not part of the battery . button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 . 4.1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements . dumped mine a month after i got it
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day . they are comfortable , easy to focus , and a great choice for the price . these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel , concerts , sports , etc
0	we use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations . the hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations . to test the microphone . i went to a noisy starbucks , huge lines , moderate music and tons of conversations . i recorded on the video cameras mics , then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature . i aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders . in all instances , there was no difference in sound quality . i then went to the sony style store in the mall and had her open a different microphone and allowed her to install it . she read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings . we could not find any difference . i checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic . once the mic is attached and turned on , the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic . i am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera . many of the new camcorders with hard drives and dvd drives do not have a mic input or active interface shoe . i would rather want a mic input so that i can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of sony to create one for their shoe . overall , i am stuck . if i record something interesting i will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing . ( the camera shots great video
0	i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
0	they tell you tha this product holds 6aa batteries , and works with the 20d 's battery grip , but when i received the item it is for a completely different product and does not work with the 20d 's bg-e2 grip . it has the product name of cpm-e3 , just as stated ... but it accepts 8 aaa batteries and does n't even come close to working with the bg-e2 .
1	good camera for the money.. picture quality excellent . used camera on recent trio to florida for spring training and colors superb.still learning the fine points and capabilties of the product . dealing through amazon exceptional . product arrived well within promised time frame . no doubt a good deal
0	i bought this for my husband for valentine 's day , so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy . unfortunately , the images appeared for one day , and then the unit stopped working . we had to send the unit back . i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item .
1	great little package ! small , compact , fits easily in your pocket . took them to giants stadium to use from my end zone seat . able to see action very clearly in the opposite end of the field . easy focus for my bad eyes
1	i made the decision to buy this camera based on the many very positive user reviews . it replaces a six year old 2.1 megapixel camera . i am not disappointed . amazon 's price is very good for a 7.1 megapixel camera with a boatload of features . it is also considerably lighter in weight than the older camera . later i read reviews by experts who give it only mediocre scores for picture quality . they criticize it for no image stabilization leading to blur ( especially at higher power zoom ) and `` noise '' at film speeds over 100 asa . i set up a couple of situations in which both problems should have been very apparent . then i enlarged smaller portions of the frames to print inexpensive 4 x 6 test photos . had i printed the full frame , the print would have been larger than an 8 x 10 . i just do not see the problems the experts criticize . the colors are rich and vibrant . i really appreciate the wide range of controls . the user can choose a from a number of modes fitted to various situations . these result in a faster shutter speed , or more depth of field , or fill-in flash , etc . it is not necessary to memorize the tiny icons on the selector dial . an on-screen prompt tells you what each mode does . i also like the amount of control in the manual mode . the user can choose the asa rating , shutter speed , apeture opening , and electronic flash mode . the manual tells how to set the camera for special situations , like photographing documents . when you take the picture , the through the lens screen goes black for part of a second . you know the picture has been taken , unlike a camera with an optical finder . the camera is very intuitive for first time use . i also read most of the manual on-line while waiting for delivery and handled the camera several times in a local discount store . when i first installed the software i restarted the computer , but it repeatedly would not recognize the camera . i switched to another usb cord and it worked fine immediately . then it also began to work with the original usb cord . i had even checked for a loose connection . who knows what that was about ! one little thing to keep in mind is this . if the camera is set on continuous auto focus , you can aim and shoot . if it is set on one-time auto focus , you must press the shutter halfway down and wait for the green light before shooting , if you want sharp pictures . i do not know , but expect the difference is battery life . a 1 gb memory card can store 485 pictures at the 7.1 megapixel resolution
0	great features , right ? i just returned it after very disappointing results . here are just a few issues : 1 . if you use a tripod ( and you will need to ) , you ca n't plug in the ac adapter to save on the short battery life , because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the ac connection . 2 . battery life is very short . 3 . if you want to protect the lens , you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens . 4 . you ca n't take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter because the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures . 5 . the automatic settings are horrible . the auto focus , auto white balance , auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors . 6 . you can not adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording . 7 . quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light . save your money . buy a camera with better features . i am waiting for the panasonic hdc-sd1 due in march
1	the case is beautiful leather . seems sturdy and well made . would have been more functional if the belt holder was open ended , i thought . i ordered it for my son , but found it very feminine when it arrived . i had to give it to someone else
0	this dock does not fit the r817 camera . just bought this and the hp r817 and i am very disappointed . the input for the camera is to big for the 817 . so do not buy this if you get the 817 **update** this review was written , when the dock was stated to fit the r817 , which has been changed because it does not fit
0	i loved the camera , absolutely loved it . i was using it one night and it died . i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened . the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying . the second time i used it , i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger . i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures . as i was looking at the pictures , it just shut off . i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose . i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine .
1	i purchased this for my canons500 . i have it for over a year now and it is still as good as new . good quality construction and a great look feel
0	this is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from . the first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of `` 600x . '' do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope ? nothing but a dim blur . note that the objective ( main ) lens is 60mm . all telescope optics have inherent limitations ; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x . therefore , with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x , the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown , and that 's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good . the finder is useless ; a 6x30 is barely adequate , and this is not even that big . finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration . the 1 1/4 '' size of the eyepiece is creditable , but too high a mignification for this scope . and the field of view is in doubt , and do n't even think of using the barlow . buy this scope , and after a few outings , it will most likely sit in the attic . the review immediately before mine is correct . this is no way to get started in astronomy . in a way , it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope . their upper-tier instruments are quite good , but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this . in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models . just make sure , gentle reader , to stay away from the toys . using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar . it is a learned skill . and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope . buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving . if you want to see the wonders of the sky , contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties . the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started . the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars ( decent ones are available on this website ) , then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm ( 6-8 '' ) dobsonian ; celestron 's own 6 '' starhopper can be found on amazon for under $ 290 . for more information on buying telescopes , see my encyclopedic guide on amazon : `` so you want to buy a telescope .
0	they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one ... ... ... .do n't think so since i got copy ... ... .poor customer service all around ... ..
1	i purchased this camera primarily as a back-up camera . but i find myself using it more and more inplace of my main camera . it is a beautiful piece of work
1	this camera delivers excellent video quality . i use it with the hot-shoe attachable microphone and the audio is quite good . i 've plugged this into my hd television and the quality is excellent . i have also had the optura xi from canon and while the build quality of the hv20 is not quite as good as that of the optura xi , the video quality is nothing short of stunning . this is a very good deal for $ 1000 . you wo n't be disappointed
1	the canon underwater housings are designed to protect your camera from the elements , whether they are sand , rain , pool , or ocean . for use on the beach , while snorkeling , or taking shots of your kids in a pool there is little or no need to worry about the buoyancy of your camera housing . if you free dive or scuba dive you do not want your camera housing floating out of your hands . these weights are an easy way to adjust the buoyancy of your housing . the kit comes with four weight plates so you can fine tune your housing 's buoyancy . i prefer a heavier setup and have added an extra plate compared to what was recommended by canon . i 'm very happy with the setup and they are very easy to use .
0	the case does not fit and the battery is incorrect for the dx759
1	the part is definitely up to nikon 's awesome standards . i bought it for future use , as i do n't currently have the lens yet , but when the price becomes affordable i will purchase it too
0	the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2 . of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100 % ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too
0	i got this for my s70 . first off , in order to use it , you have to set the s70 to `` radio control '' ( about 9 button pushes ) . then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so ( and only in *front* of the camera-the remote does n't work from the rear ! ) . oh , and if you want to adjust your framing , forget it-the zoom is immobilized . if you need a `` cable release , '' i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera . it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings , and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time .
0	crap . does n't work . wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period . plastic junk , never did get a good signal . the worst sony item i 've ever purchased -- and i 'm a sony fan . will still attempt to return somehow . do n't even bother
1	this handy little tool is a must have for not just nikon owners , but all camera owners . a genius of design and function , i would whole-heartedly urge every person with a camera to buy one , or many , asap
0	the main reason for buying this camera is to be able to take good pictures from far away . the quality is very poor . the unit is very bulky to carry around your neck . the sd card slot has some block in it . i was not able to even insert an sd card . all in all , not satisfied at all
1	i use my canon 10d mainly for astrophotography . most of the time , it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods of time , anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes . this ack-e2 adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or a drained one , while i control the camera remotely sitting inside my house . continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flash storage . the package included several ac power connectors which is very useful while travelling . amazon provides a wide range of items to choose from .
1	this scope is one of the best gen 1 units on the market . at 36 lines/mm , it has just about the best resolution . most other units only have 24 lines/mm . the illuminator is bright ( almost too bright ) , uniform , and has a crisp edge . it could be a bit larger , however , so that it would fill the field of view . note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens , ( to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification ) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof . do n't bother with the ir flashlight . it 's output is actually less than the built-in illuminator and it is far from uniform .
0	i purchased this camera and took it to the beach . the photos were so bad , i threw them away . the images were all washed-out and blurry . also , the film advancing mechanism is very tricky , so several of the pictures i took overlapped each other . i 've used other disposable cameras before that would n't let you take a picture until the film had been fully advanced to the next frame . with this camera , i advanced the film until the mechanism stopped , and the camera allowed me to take another picture . unfortunately , the film had n't advanced fully and the next picture partially overlapped the previous picture that i had taken . what a waste of money this camera was ! thankfully , i had also taken my digital camera , so i still had some good pictures of my trip : )
1	my search for a semi pro digicam made me do a lot of research and after i shortlisted a few models i had to find the best deal . amazon helped me get that deal and today when i look at the performance of the camera so far.. i am amazed ... the camera was bound to be good but a special thanks to amazon.com for helping me get one at a gr8 price
0	the camera ( canon s-80 ) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card , much less a second battery pack or the charger . i ended up using my old tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories . total waste of $ $ $
1	this 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera , so it 's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm . i was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens ; and it 's rectilinear , which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph . it is a well-made lens , made with high-grade materials . what this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes , close-quarters interior photography , and in architectural photography where you do n't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces . personally , that 's what i like , so i 'm very happy with this sigma 10-20mm
1	i enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera . my minolta dimage x ( about 15 % small in size than this camera ) had reached the end of its useful life , having been around for about 5 years . the minolta had a 3/4 '' screen on the back . ( this one has a 2.5 '' screen- great colors ) the best feature i liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens . i do n't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty . therefore , i was excited that this camera had an internal zoom . tonight i was at a bulls game , in the 300 section ( nose bleed ) , and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of kirk hinrich . the 3x optical zoom is incredible , but more so incredible is the digital zoom . i was also able to zoom into the jumbotron , and it looked as crisp as if i was taking the photo directly . action shots are great . low light shots are great ! it is exactly what i was looking for
1	i bought the rebel xt w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the xti was introduced , but that 's another story . as this is my first dslr , i was blown away by the results . but after the initial euphoria , there is always room for improvement . my first choice was the 28-200 , favoring the longer zoom over the is , but i found this one used at penn camera and got a deal on it and a 380ex flash , so the decision was made for me . i like the zoom range , it 's great for framng portraits . if i need wider angle , i still have the kit lens . i wo n't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes , as i was prepared for this by these reviews before i ever saw the lens . i 'm no expert on sharpness , and still trying to get myself dialed in , but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me . i have no `` l '' lenses to compare to , nor would i make the comparison if i did . in my somewhat uninformed opinion , this is a great step up from the kit lens . this is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with . being a working guy , i 'm extremely happy with it so far , and glad i made the purchase .
0	i love my nikon coolpix 5900 however , the lens failed in less than one year . service took 6 weeks to repair . the lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair . why is the lens failing to open again ? i absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although i do have a paid plan for it . why ca n't warranty be fast , local and competent
0	they say 100 % compatible but is not , because is not an info ion-litio , so is not a eqivalent battery , dos n't work . do n't expend your money on this stupid batter
1	this camera is very similar to the fuji f30 , but has face detection ( fd ) that autofocuses on faces in a photo . great for taking pictures of yourself , or for snapshots you do n't have time to compose . excellent quality photos in dim light . at 3200 iso , photos are washed out and noisy , but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss . option to limit iso to 1600 , or to 400 . camera will use any speed up to the limit . 400 iso is extremely good . as good as my canon digital rebel xti . usual modes i never use ( flower , landscape , etc . ) , but one unique mode i use all the time : no flash/flash . the camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 iso , and then takes a picture with flash immediately after . usually takes less than one second to capture both images . no flash does n't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot , while the following flash guarantees you 'll get the image , even if the `` warm glow of candlelight '' is ruined . i always have the camera set to this mode . uses xd cards , which i hate , but if you buy a 1 gb card you 'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card . also , battery life is unbelieveable ! fully charge the camera over several hours , and you 'll be able to take 400 photos , half with flash , before the battery is drained . fuji-brand underwater housing is optional , watertight to 40m ( 121 ft. ) camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours , and still keep the intense blue of the water . literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras . i recommend this camera without hesitation . there simply is n't anything else like it on the market .
0	quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 i purchased as gifts . in fact , the recipients asked me to return them . main reason , in order for it to be `` portable '' it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $ 30 . i already spent $ 100 , not planning on spending more money . i think photoco needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction .
0	conclusions : to start from the end i got the xacti ca6 , tested it and returned it . here are the pros and cons . pros - 1 . very small , just put in your pocket and go 2 . easy and simple controls 3 . super fast start up from sleep mode 4 . good video quality when lighting conditions are good 5. the ability to take stills while in video mode ( i had no issue with the video pausing , no way around that ) 6 . you get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price 7 . sd card that records for a long time 8 . easy transfer to computer for editing cons - 1 . indoor video unacceptable , although the video is brighter the ones my sony digicam takes , it is extremely grainy ( more so than my sony digicam videos ! ! ) 2 . super slow zoom when in video mode 3 . in good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry ( especially when trying to capture a kid on the move , for scenery it might be ok ) 4 . in low lighting stills are unusable ( even at short distance ) due to a very , very weak flash . 5 . red eye almost every time the flash works 6 . strap is a joke 7 . no lens cover so in short , on paper this camera is great , i love having the sd format rather than tape or dvd , the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless . but ... .the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting ( see above ) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions ( for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical ) . this camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand ( for taking stills ) . for almost everyone else it is not adequate , i will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a minidv camcorder ( going for the elura 100 ) ... .. ya , i know people told me that this was the best option beforehand , i was hoping to prove them wrong ... . ; - (
1	very well made . once you are holding it you will feel the price was quite low for a product this solid and well designed .
1	if you do n't need the speed or ca n't afford the expensive 85mm f1.4 nikkor lens or both , then this lens may be the right one for you . it took nikon a while to produce a superb compact 85mm lens , but this time they finally got it right . without a doubt , this is a fine portrait lens for photographing head-and-shoulder portraits ( the only lens which is optically better is nikon 's legendary 105mm f2.5 nikkor lens , and its close optical twin , the 105mm f2.8 micro nikkor. ) . since the 105mm f2.5 nikkor lens does n't have an autofocus version , then this might be the perfect moderate telephoto lens for owners of nikon autofocus slr cameras . regardless , this lens has a well-earned reputation for excellent contrast and resolution
1	when i bought a digital camera , i already knew that i would need rechargeable batteries for it . what i did n't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines . i had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate ! so i looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with monster cable 's products . it performs better than advertised . the initial charge may have taken 3 hours , but subsequent charges have been much quicker . i have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they wo n't operate the camera . the charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance , and has an led indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged . it is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it . i have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger
0	it is hardly one month old and the pockets on the sides have already started coming off . it is not the stuff that i expected froma brand name like panasonic
0	this product is worthless . you 'd be better off keeping your money and buying a good case at a store . overpriced , cheap , plastic-y rip-off . no `` deluxe '' here
1	this lens is amazing . nothing escapes it . it 's like a black hole . clearly the best lens i have ever owned . it 's like the lidless eye of sauron from the lord of the rings . it is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera . it comes with a beautiful case , a hood , and a tripod mount on the lens . believe me you will need it . i took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great . i will now get to work reading the small manual . it has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings . wow !
0	hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states , i have a problem with my camera and i do n't have anyone to help , i 've been trying some help in amazon 's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where i can ask for some help , i do n't really understand why is this site so well known on customer service , but i just can not communicate with no one in the company to ask anything , i 'm just mad about this , if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there 's no such a thing like help in the help area . i need to repair my lcd monitor of my camera , it 's really fragile , so if you 're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm , do n't do it , they do n't care about the customer satisfaction at all
1	there are no professionals or would-be professional photographers in our house . instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family . we 're not particularly interested in birds , flowers , bugs , race cars , etc . we want to catch our kids doing what they love best ; football , basketball , swimming , band , golf ... my only advantage is that i am very experienced with adobe photoshop , which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots . this year our son is a high-school senior . instead of buying an expensive portrait package , we voted to spend the money on a canon digital rebel xt kit ( with lens ) . we choose one extra zoom lense ( the 75-300mm f4-5.6 iii usm telephoto ) for up-close action sports shots . we did n't chose the is lens because it was out of our price range . we are having great fun with this camera and lens . we have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic ' sports setting on the camera ( burst mode at full zoom ) . they are great - crisp and clear . these have been taken in full sun . we realize that we 'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations . but i think we can do it . i would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots . they might not be professional quality , but they are just what we wanted
0	i read the reviews and thought i 'd still give it a try . after one battery charge , i was `` lucky '' enough to have a defective unit - the camera would n't start again after the first charge . my observations from that first short use were : - quality of pictures was very poor ( my pentax optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos ) -- very disapointing for a 6mp camera . - the flash was generally useless , and actually hurt quality - the camera was very uncomforable if you do n't have very small hands . my wrist hurt after using it for 20 minutes . - the video was ok , but the focus was very slow ( and noisy ) . - i had the same problem as several others -- that the camera died shortly afer getting it ( shows very poor quality ) . all-in-all do n't waste your money . you can get a much better camera at a lower price
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera . the colors and the features are amazing . is very easy to use . the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button . if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out .
1	this is panasonic 's entry-level camcorder , but it 's packed with useful features , like good image quality , 12 lux sensitivity , and a whopping 30x optical zoom . i think it 's perfect for casual travel videography as well as for shooting entries to the `` america 's funniest video '' show . it 's fairly easy to use and the build quality is solid . a good optional accessory to get is a spare battery . you never know if the battery might run out at the most inopportune time , so be sure to pick up a backup one . given the recent dell recall of 4.1 million laptops due to battery fire , you should get a genuine panasonic liion battery designd specifically for this model . do n't put your life or your loved one 's at risk . the reviewer named `` hung '' got it totally wrong ( or was just plain lying ) . the gs29 does come with ieee1394 firewire ( aka i.link ) so you can download your videos quickly to your pc ; if your pc does n't already have an ieee1394 port , you can get a pci ieee1394 card for $ 30 or less . you can use windows movie maker , included with windows me and xp , to edit your videos and export them to cds or dvds .
0	i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here . i 'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i 've had these problems from the gitgo : -i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly , they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you 'd need force to expand/retract them . very interestingly , if the section right above the one i 'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless ! -the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) a less than 2 lbs combo , which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs . the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly . again , it might have been a defective unit , but i thought i 'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted to buy this from amazon , it was n't in stock , it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $ 40+ , so i went elsewhere and got it for $ 30 .
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally . but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you ca n't even tell what you have taken . if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did , on this useless piece of crap
1	i really enjoy my photosmart r725 . it 's small , easy portable , takes wonderful photos , and is very versatile in terms of settings . i just have one thing i do n't like about it , and that 's the fact that there is no viewfinder . there is an lcd screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder , but it 's hard to see in bright sunlight , and i 'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use . for now , it 's great but i 'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run . at the same time , it 's not spendy , so it might be worth it
0	i bought this for my 9 year old son to take movies and edit on the pc . it worked for about 2 days before there was no image from the lens to either the lcd or the viewfinder . i could see other information on the lcd , such as the date , time , menu , but no image from the screen . i called samsung and that is where it is now for repairs . a check of the web indicated that this problem is well documented . i did try to install the software that came with the camera , but that did not go to well either . i will retry when i get a working camera again .
0	this camera is a decent enough camera , compact , easy to use and takes good quality video and still pictures and the battery life is excellent . the battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour . i acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so i never worry about running out of juice . i have only two complaints really , one minor and one major . the minor complaint is the fiddly little controls on the touch screen lcd viewfinder . i find i need to use my reading glasses to see what i 'm doing . the major complaint is transfering video to my computer via the ilink cable ( not supplied ) . i have never persuaded it to work . by browsing various camera fora on the web i am finding a complaint identical to mine with this model in particular as well as other sony models . the computer will recognize the camera in usb mode ( for capturing still pictures from the memory stick ) but does not see it at all when plugged in via ilink ( firewire/ieee 1394 ) . all indications are that my firewire port and cable are perfectly ok. sony tech support , both web chat based and phone , have no clue and because i am out of warranty it will cost a flat $ 210 to send it in and have them take a look at it . if all you want to do is connect the camera to your tv to playback the video you take , it 's a good camera . if video capture an editing is what you have in mind , buyer beware . because of this , i can only give the product 2 stars , other wise it would be a 5 . update : i installed a new firewire pci card on my computer and using a new cable tried the video capture again . i also tried the camera on my neighbor 's mac ( on the theory that if a mac wo n't recognize it you really know you have a problem ) . the computer still wo n't recognize the camera . this camera has been used very little and definitely not abused . it was probably defective right out of the box and it appears to be a common problem . if you buy this , make sure you test all of its capabilities as soon as you get it . do n't wait like i did because i 'm out of warranty and it will cost me to get the problem fixed
1	this is my first digital picture frame , so i do not have anything to compare it against . i am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use , and i am happy with the resolution and the picture quality . the only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all , and as one other reviewer noted , i had to learn how to do things by trial and error . i also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images , it is not `` saved '' to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time . however , i like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next christmas
1	i 've had it for several weeks now and it seems like a great camera . i am still learning new features . i would highly recommend it
1	i bough this waterproof case for a trip to st. thomas over christmas . the photographs that we took came out perfect . the flash diffuser worked well , by eliminating the air bubbles that normally are captured with underwater cameras . make sure that you set up your camera to the underwater mode so that it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance . the only problem that i had was since it is so compact , i often accidently would move the switch to movie mode . this ruined a few photographs , but also made a great movie of a sea turtle coming up for air . i know that it was expensive , but much cheaper than buying a new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras and having x-ray machines fog up the pictures
1	we canoe/kayak down various rivers and creeks . i wanted a way to take my $ 1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it . the sports pack is completely water proof ( up to 7m ) . i 've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry . the case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality . it is relatively simple to operate and assemble . you have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case , so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used . my only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area . so far i have n't had any problems but i 've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs . all told , i 'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water i would recommend this case
0	the only reason i am giving this 1 start is becuase of amazon 's poor service , otherwise i would give 5 stars for the product . i placed this order more than 30 days ago . amazon still has not shipped the item so i cancelled my order and placed it with j if amazon did not have the item in stock , they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in shipping
0	this camera is garbage . it was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money . it was hard to figure out , it took lousy pictures , it burned through batteries . avoid this camera . i just wish i could give it zero stars
0	the en-el3a is a works fine and with no problems . however , amazon is misleading its customers by putting a lower price from a partner company as the primary price of the item . amazon should market the item at it 's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner . the 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon 's misleading advertisment
1	i bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because i knew that if she was going to try digital photography , it had to be easy ! the printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends . i have used the older cx-7300 , ( very similar camera ) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions . the lack of optical zoom is a plus for me ; less to break . the c530 is more compact , has better resolution , and still has the option of using aa batteries when the rechargables die . if you want simple digital snapshots , you will love this little camera
1	after much research i finally found the binoculars that fit my every need . the price was right , the delivery was right on schedule , and the product is excellent
0	it 's not an item to write home about . final picture quality is usually ok but not spectacular . the wi-fi works some days , mostly not . if i 'd known then what i know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser .
1	i have a wall hung plasma tv with speakers from my surround system mounted on either side . i was able to locate all the receivers in another room for a super clean installation . the hot pro ir target is very sensitive ! ! initially i had the hot pro `` box '' too close to another tv and the blue indicator light was always on . if it 's glowing , you need to move something . once the indicator is n't lit but flashes when you use your remote , it works flawlessly
0	i got for christmas , it was easy to use but only lasted 1 day then the screen does not turn on , , , stay away from this one !
1	this is a fabulous gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures . just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable , probably since the product is new . do n't bypass their software to load the pix if you 're transferring from your pc to the frame - their software reduces the memory needed for each one . and even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same , it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time
1	photos printed are very sharp . some difficulty with printer cartidge and as expensive as they are , you ca n't afford to have much difficulty . good for craft times with the kids
1	this is a great lens for star fields . it is about the least expensive lens canon makes and also one of the fastest . the focus was sharp to the corners without coma . see my photo of a portion the milky way . this was obtained with a 30sec exposure with a rebel xt on an inexpensive clock drive sitting on a picnic table
1	the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i 've ever owned . my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography . i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel . after a few months of owning it i still am amazed . the image quality is fantastic , it 's quick and responsive , and every day using it i learn a little more . it 's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it 's easy to learn . i 've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot . if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot , go for this camera , you wont be sorry .
1	this lens hood designed specificaly for the coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory . it does more than just protecting the lens , which it certainly does , esp . for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid . ( do n't forget murphy 's law . ) but the lens hood can also improve your picture quality . as with slr lenses , the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture . this is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused ( scattered ) . just use this all the time ( see exception below ) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best ( all other factors being equal , of course ) . the only times you should *not* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700 , esp . indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source . the hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject . even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light , you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure . get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera
1	this case is extremely stylish , high grade leather , with a very strong magnetic closure and a useful belt clip . highly recommended for sony t10 and other camera models listed in description
0	half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless . should have sent it back
0	i 've had this camera just over a year ( figures ) and it has gone completely bonkers on me . sometimes it works and other times it puts black lines across the screen making it useless . you never know when you turn it on whether it will work or not -- making it completely unreliable . keep in mind that this camera was used almost entirely inside for my business , so it was n't abused , dropped , thrown in the bottom of a purse , etc . it was treated very carefully and probably only shot about 2,000 pictures total . frankly , i 'm kind of glad it broke so that i have an excuse to replace it . here 's why : 1 . takes beautiful still shots , but forget about any kind of action . it takes too long between shots to get good action . it also blurs nearly all the action shots i 've ever taken , regardless of what mode it 's in . 2 . the red-eye is aweful . it should do better . i doubt that i 'll ever buy another canon
1	i had viewed concert photos taken with the s2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away . saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they did n't even come close . i was using the canon a80 prior and while i was happy with it , my first round of photos with the s2 proved to be most impressive . while you can use this as a point and shoot , this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it . and although the s3 is the latest version of the camera , i 'm not sure you get that much more for the money
0	i have two 8 '' picture frames that are other brands , and they are great and i use them for open houses all the time ! i got this one as a gift from a friend , and it is terrible ! ! the instructions are difficult to understand . the wide screen makes everyone in the picture look fat and distorted ! this is a weird size and i am not happy at all ! ! i do n't recommend it
0	beware of poor cs policy at jvc . they recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built . they were not interested in even trying to help . i hate it when companies only care about their profits
0	so this was my first digital camera , got it last july for my birthday . i go to a lot of concerts , so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects . well , two days after i got it , i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white . it would still take pics , only you couldnt see them . after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on , it went back to normal . alarmed , i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again . it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again . but that was only one thing wrong with it . this is a horrible camera for concerts , the pictures are always blurry . shoot , even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes . tuesday i went to see my fav band again , and the dumb thing goes white . it woudnt stop , no matter how many times i turned it off and on again . now the flash is broke and i 'm ready to throw it against the wall . you ca n't trust this camera . you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute !
1	the ergonomics : perfect . the d200 is not completely rubber-encased . there 's rubber where your hands need to hold it , and plastic where your hands rarely touch it . the hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in . the battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic , and hinge-pinned . a simple slide latch opens the battery door ... .and some have warned the latch could be easily ( accidentally ) tripped . the memory card door latch , however , uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 and video out/dc-in doors are made of flexible rubber , and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves . the english language operating manual is a work of art . each operating concept is alpha ' numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram , and to the page where the function is explained in perfect english . the reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized . i like the depth of field preview , the mirror lock-up , and the multiple-exposure capability . the continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object . if you have the old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses from the '70 's and '80 's , except for a few rare exceptions , will fit on the d200 . all these positive attributes remind me of the best , most highly-evolved film camera slr 's . no wonder so many photographers have been won over to digital media .
