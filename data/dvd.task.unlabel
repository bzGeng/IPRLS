Great visual of the battle where my great grandfather fought with the 6th SC. Entertaining and educational 
There is no questioning this film is done very well. That said, it should be pointed out that it may not be for everyone. If you are not a fan of cliches, stay away from this. There are TONS of monologues that go on for long periods of time with epic music in the background, and maybe not everyone can handle that. Most of the performances are incredible, my favorite happens to be Jeff Daniels. One performance that doesn't do it for me is Martin Sheen. He shares a lot of scenes with Tom Berenger and it seems like Berenger is the one keeping those scenes afloat. C. Thomas Howell has a steady part but you won't recognize him as the kid from the Outsiders. Great battle scenes, especially the big one in the open field at the end. 
After the heart-rending nobility of Abraham Lincoln's verbal tribute to Gettysburg's fallen, there is not much else that could do those men justice. Yet GETTYSBURG does so. This 1993 film, second in a civil war trilogy that begins with GODS AND GENERALS and concludes with LAST FULL MEASURE is worlds beyond its predecessor in cinematographic and dramatic prowess. To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a profoundly moving four hours of personalized history. A film like this helps us to recall that we are not yet one hundred fifty years from southeastern Pennyslvania's momentary appearance as a killing field. In America's most costly war, this was its linchpin battle. Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen turn in understated and powerful renderings of Confederate generals. Sheen's Robert E. Lee carries a mountain's weight of burden on his grieving shoulders even as he makes the decisions that will send still more Virginia gentlemen and Texas cowboys to their deaths. Jeff Daniels far outshines his earlier representation of Maine's Coronel Chamberlain, the six-times wounded college professor who would finish his working life as the president of Bowdoin College. The panoramic battle scenes provided legions of Civil War reenactors with their glorious opportunity, one that - with the exception of a handful of volunteers who couldn't help grinning while they were being shot down - seized the day with remarkable poignance. This one is for seeing again and again, remembering, and bowing one's head against the awful fact that nations are too often born in blood 
If you're into the Civil War, this is the movie for you. It tells the battle from both sides. It follows the activities of both sides. This is a must have for fans of the Civil War 
This is one of the best movie about the civil war I've ever seen. It is the most instructive, realistic, with very good actors playing in it ! For once, just like in "Gods and Generals", the movie is more focused on the southern side, which is not very often the case. I am a fan of this part of the U.S. history, and especially of the South, and I was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end 
Almost a complete scope of the battle of the size of the battle in numbers and cause. Would have like to have heard Lincoln's Address at the end for now it is a rememberance of the dead of both sides of the battle that, I think, unitesw us now into this great nation 
This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle. I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary. It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park. When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened. Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle. These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows. As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class. When I timed Pickett's Charge, I realized it is shown in real time. Those Confederate soldiers charged into Union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie. Read The Killer Angels and then see this outstanding movie. Kyle Prat 
Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works. I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast. But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice. And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting. Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping. Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief. But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production. I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable. The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance. If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator. It falls a bit short of that, however. Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery. They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept. Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war. The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book. The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War. The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg. C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie. Still and all, the film is very watchable. And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film 
Alright, Im sure you already know what its about, if not, then just read above, because im here, trying to tell you why you should watch it. I know, Ill get this out of the way fast. Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be! People argue that its not scary, or that the twist ending was horrible. Its not a horror movie, its not suposed to scare you. Its a love story. And listen to this: the twist ending?, its not suposed to be a surprise, its suposed form this whole movie, its suposed to define who these characters are, and what they are trying to do. This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence. I just dont see how people who are fans of Shyamalans other movies can say "I hated the ending, very predictable" because, fans, you know what Shyamalan does, you know from seeing Signs that hes a deep writer, that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be. So please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway. Why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like, or dont like? Sure, many didnt like it, some didnt even understand it, but that doesnt mean you wont like it. You just have to try it out. If you havent had the end ruined for you, thats even better, because you still have this whole movie to look forward to, and if you dont enjoy it, than fine, but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it. I know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews. If you enjoy a good love story, or even an art-sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it. But its not for everyone. Im sure, if you get bored easily, or if you dont have an imagination (this is a MUST HAVE for any Shyamalan film) And then theres the soundtrack, which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical. Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie. But before I leave, trust me, dont watch this thinking its a horror movie, because its not. Thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film 
I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy. The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story. The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace. But still a great movie 
I once thought I was almost alone in liking this creepy and fun 2004 film, but the fact is it seems to be growing on people. It just took a while for those who emerged from theaters declaring The Village a two-hour life support system for a twist ending to appreciate that there's a lot more to this movie than its concluding surprise. (No, I won't give it away, even if by now nearly everyone surely knows what that surprise is, but if you don't know, be careful about reading any farther.) What I grasped about The Village, aside from embracing a story I liked for itself, and for its ending which I didn't see coming, was a message of optimism that said it is possible for people to escape the boundaries and rules of an oppressive time and place, and recreate reality to suit their preferences. Think about that for a minute. People go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today, for instance, with its violence, its corporate intrusions, its governmental omnipresence, and here we saw a successful experiment in utopian existence set in 1890, and I found that wonderful. I also loved the scenery, the muted color schemes, the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life. The performances of Bryce Dallas Howard, Joachim Phoenix, and William Hurt were also highly underrated. Never has a stretch of bare woods surrounding a meadow looked so foreboding. Never has the monster in the fairy tale been so close at hand. I liked The Village from the first day I saw it, and continue to think well of it even now 
The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable. I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted. And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera. If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes. I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode. Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho 
This movie is the most boring, uninteresting piece of garbage I have ever wasted my money on. The plot is stupid, the characters are dull and insipid, and the whole movie leaves you asking, as the credits run, "So What?" Don't waste your money! 
if you are expecting to be scared out of your pants - don't - this movie is not scary but more suspenseful. it is a great movie, with awesome twists and anyone who said that they figured out this movie is a liar. this movie is perfectly written, acted and directed. see this movie 
This entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it. Unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and I couldn't wait for it to end. I saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was. At least a quarter of them walked out before the end. It's that bad. It's a shame, I love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted 
It's strange; this just came on FX, and once it was on, I was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing, even though I've already seen it (in the theatres during its initial release run), and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around. Even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with "Lady In The Water" (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like "Hostel" and those damned "Saw" movies (enough, already)! At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like "The Exorcist" - if that's what you want, buy and watch "The Exorcist". If you're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen, buy this movie. Even if you know what happens in the end, I'm sure you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time 
I knew the ending within the first 10 minutes. M. Night Shamalamadingdong disappointed me and should go back to his job at Denny's 
It was a delight to see this childhood memory again, and in pristine quality with color (if you prefer it in original black white, turn the color down on your tv set). It brings this 60s series to a whole new generation of fans (my nephews nieces wouldn't watch it in b) 
I'm not reviewing the show itself, but rather the colorization. (If you've seen the show, you know whether you like it; if you haven't seen it, you can read the many other reviews.) The show is lighthearted fun and not to be taken seriously, but if I'm bothered by the colorization, it must be really bad. Unless you like Jeannie with orange hair and people who look like they've drunk a bottle of ink, skip this version and get the BW set. Then you won't be constantly distracted by weird and wrong colors 
I'm not sure why Sony, which now owns I Dream of Jeannie, decided to colorize the first season of this series. Whatever the reason, you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on Amazon.com that the original black-and-white version of the first season is worth a lot more. The reason for that is simple--I Dream of Jeannie was originally broadcast in black-and-white. And for a television fan like myself, that's the ONLY way to watch the first season. The episodes themselves are just as I remember seeing them. Since I wasn't around in 1965, I'm pretty sure I've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here. But to me, they're still pretty good. The theme music, in my opinion, is every bit as good as the second theme, introduced when Jeannie went to color in 1966. The one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that Sony stripped off the old Screen Gems animation from the end of every episode. That logo was attached to so many classic shows from the 1960s and 1970s, and it is consistenly rated, along with Viacom's old blue V of Doom, as the scariest logo in the history of television. The new Sony outro doesn't pack the same punch. Still, if you liked Jeannie way back when, you'll love it now, especially since you can watch it anytime you like, without commercial interruption 
There was something special about the first season. And this has been colorized,and it realy is great the way they did that.There was a few moments you could tell it was a bit fake,but accross the board it realy has been a great effort to get it looking like this. And if you dont like the color version,simply turn off the color on your TV! The pilot episode is a personal favorite of mine how it got things started.Especially that bit when she came out of Toney's room with that long shirt!Oh those thigh's! Amazingly Barbera Eden got pregnant during this season,and had to wear an extra veil to cover up her pregnancy. I have been in love with that woman since i was about 5 
Like "lighten up already 2" said in the review of this DVD, I want historical accruacy. I wrote my opinions of the colorized versions of vintage B shows in a review of Bewitched the Complete Second Season, which is available in a colorized version. To summarize that review, would an antique dealer ruin a valuable, antique, mahogany, piece of furniture by painting it a bright red ? 
This is one of my all time favorite tv shows. Although same in concept and scope than Bewitched, this shows superior cast and performances tower over Bewitched. I believe this show was much more funnier than Bewitched. Barbara Eden stars as Jeannie and Larry Hagman stars as Cap.(later Maj.) Anthony Nelson. And Bill Daily stars as Roger Healy, Maj. Nelsons best friend. This dvd set covers the entire 1st season (30 episodes) of the series. Since this series 1st season was shot in black and white, this is the preference for me over the alternative colorized dvd set. As far as the video and audio go, the video looks fantastic. Episodes are clean and sharp with no compression. No dirt or scratches noticeable. Audio is in clean 2.0 mono sound. All episodes are complete and uncut. The pilot episode includes a audio commentary with Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily. It's nice and pleasant but not very informative. This is the main problem I have about this set. NO INFORMATION!! To me this keeps this set from getting 5 stars. The 4 dvds come in 2 seperate cases covering all 30 episodes. On the back of the cases you get episode #, title of each episode, and small description of each one. I think there should be more info than this, so I had hoped when I played the dvds, got to the main menu, and selected an episode, I would get a small amount of trivia, some more details such as production date, 1st broadcast date, and cast listing with special guest stars. No such luck. I had hoped for much more info about each episode. You get a 14 minute featurette with new interviews with Sidney Sheldon, Larry Hagmen, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily, which is a nice (but short) special feature. It's nice to see them together and still very good friends. They were the backbone of this great show (along with the late Hayden Roarke). Hayden Roarke was wonderful as Dr. Alfred Bellows. I would have loved for him to have been there too. In closing this is still a great set to have, and I intend to have all 5 seasons of this great show. I highly recommend the b+w dvd version of this classic show 
I love i dream of jeannie, it's just so wholesome and entertaining at the same time. The only thing I wish they've included in the DVD is English subtitles. Sometimes if you've missed what the characters are saying at least you can always check the subtitles. But other than that I'm very glad they've put the series out on DVD. 
I'm waiting for the release of Season 3 - the best one! This is where Jeannie's evil dark-haired sister shows up for the first time. So silly, so much fun, sweet memories .. 
Finally, another of my favorite sitcoms is released on DVD! I've enjoyed watching re-run after re-run of this "gem" of a series for years. For quite awhile the first season was not even a part of the syndicated episodes. Barbara Eden is fantastic as Jeannie. Poor Tony Nelson didn't realize how lucky he really was! Larry Hagman played the part of Anthony Nelson with great comedic timing. Larry and Barbara together made a fantastic team! I love the interviews with Barbara, Larry and Bill Daily. Even today, the three of them come across as best friends. It's no wonder they were so good together in the series! I Dream Of Jeannie will always be one of the funniest shows ever to grace our TV screens! I'm not thrilled about the movie version soon to be released- I'll stick with what is best-THE ORIGINAL! Now I will wait for one more of my favorite shows-THE PATTY DUKE SHOW 
Wonderful shows/episodes. My favorite sitcom. I wish that they played I dream of Jeannie on the television at prime time instead of the junk they have now. You do not have to monitor this program. It is one that almost any age can enjoy. 
As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories. The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona. This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's. Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960. The people were wonderful to grow up with. This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer. I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD. I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts. Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating 
This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing. I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it. Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again. I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake. This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long. Hidalgo is the name of the horse. So what? That's about as boring as this movie. So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo. I did not, however, like this movie. It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again. If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
Love this movie, caught some of it on TV one week so then did a search on Amazon and brought the movie. Family entertainment Loosly based on the real life Frank T Hopkins who did more to save the wild Mustang than any other 
Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all. Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the "Ocean of Fire" in the 1890's. This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver. The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a "cowboy'. We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke. And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American. This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins. Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world. When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life. Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity. Viggo must have definitely "lived" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them. He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing. Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series. This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance. Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover. 
Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true. `Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon. If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the "Ocean of Fire". Highly Recommended 
The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses. Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies. Not so with Viggo Mortensen. Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney. Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit. Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office. Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it. All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com. In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse. Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race. Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go. The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created. We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc... It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana! During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit. The movie ends on a triumphal note for both. The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals. The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area! My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie. I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up 
In this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of Frank T. Hopkins, Viggo Mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character. Whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether Frank T. Hopkins actually existed is irrelevant. What is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted. Frank T. Hopkins is an accomplished rider. He has been a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army, a Pony Express rider, and he has been in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. Frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile Ocean of Fire, a race that has been held for one thousand years. After the obligatory refusal (all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero) he travels by sea to the Middle East. A side note. The movie begins with the infamous Wounded Knee massacre. The memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts Frank. I will discuss these distractions more later in this review. This movie finally comes into its own when the Ocean of Fire race begins. Several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race. Numerous attempts are made to kill Frank during the race. Of course, Frank manages to survive all these attempts. He also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess, and to save his horse from spikes, big cats, and bullets, not to mention heat, thirst and hunger. Nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining. The title of the movie comes from the mustang named Hidalgo. Hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character. Hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie. Sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie. The only issue I had with this movie was the distractions. I thought the Wounded Knee massacre, while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie, to be a distraction from the race. Even though Frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert, we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were. I also thought the release of the wild mustangs by Frank could have been handled more succinctly, though I admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the Midwest was inspiring. Throwing in all the details about Jazira, the daughter of Sheikh Riyadh (played by the great Omar Sharif) were further distractions. The result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly. I thought Viggo Mortenson was great as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies. He does an equally good job as Frank T. Hopkins. Enjoy the race; enjoy the rescue of the princess; fast forward through the rest. 
I have to say that I really enjoyed this film. It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days. Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed. This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint. If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it. And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him. He is a very good actor and an underated one at that. So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure. And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!! 
Here's an "epic" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia. Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as "The Mummy." Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them. Frankly, I thought the "slow" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did. Another big plus was the cinematography. This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts. Another good point is the language: hardly a swear word. On the negative side, there was the usual political correctness, a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys. The horse race had some credibility problems, too, as "Hidalgo" came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat! Anyway, if you are looking for a modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you and the rest of the family 
This is a very entertaining movie with the horse stealing the show, of course. I also like that it is based on a real person. 
My daughters ages 4 and 9 own this dvd and don't like it. They also own the billy blanks tae bo for kids and love it. My 9 yr. old especially likes the tae bo better. I bought this thinking that it would give them another kind of workout, but they don't want to do this one at all. I thought they would, and I'm sure as the other reviews have stated, love it but they didn't. I guess it just depends on the child 
Great workout for our kids us parents too....simple to follow, very effective, and our 4 kids from baby to pre-teen jump in and kick. The coach is very optimistic and positive. I also like the extra defense techniques shown to children. It was very much worth the money....especially good on Rainy and Snowy Days 
Wish this vid had another workout. Amazing interest at first. Got old quickly 
I would highly recommend this video if you are looking for something to motivate kids and that they can keep up with and have fun but still get a good work-out. It is based on martial arts but does not include violence toward other people. Instead, he picks apples and oranges and kicks soccer balls. The video is also split up (for example, Warm Up and Cool Down) so it is easy to pause and grab a drink of water if you need one. 
My kids absolutly LOVE this program. The children on the program are clearly having fun, which makes it so much more fun for the viewer, especially when the viewers are children themselves. The guy leading the group is just awesome with kids. He interacts with them throughout the entire program, and really makes it a lot of fun. My kids have seen their share of kid's exercise programs, and until we saw this one, they weren't very happy with any of them. This program really makes them feel good about themselves, and really makes them feel good about exercising. I have seen this video in the #1 spot for quite a while, but because it was priced a little higher than some of the other videos, I thought I would save a few dollars try them instead. - BIG MISTAKE!!! NOW I wish I would have bought this video first, and saved the money I spent on the other videos. Kick to Get Fit Jr. - for kids is truly worth the few extra dollars. _ This is difinitely a case where you get what you have paid for. A few extra dollars = a much better product. - Atleast in this case it does! 
I bought this mainly for my 7 yr old son, but even the older children I care for (I run a family daycare) really enjoy this. All the kids give it two thumbs way up. 
I purchased this for my 4-year-old son, and we love it. The moves are very easy to follow and extremely non-violent. He compares the martial arts moves to picking apples and oranges versus upper cuts and jabs. The kids in the video are just kids -- they don't perform everything perfectly so as not to make your little feel incompetent. Great for all ages 
This program is simply the best kid's program I've ever seen. I really can't say a lot that hasn't already been said in other reviews, I just wanted to also voice my opinion as to how terrific this program is. - A couple of quick points that make this program so special are; the instructor, the program itself, and the amount of fun the kids on the program are having, and the amount of fun my children have doing the program. - The instructor has a great time interacting with the kids on the program, and also to the viewers at home. He is funny, but yet professional with his instruction, and really does a good job with the kids. - The program itself is like nothing I've ever seen before, the movements are a combination of karate techniques (with a non-violent approach), aerobic movements, and basic physical education activities, it's a very nice blend, and it really flows together well. - And last, but certainly not least, this program is FUN to do, and easy enough for all my kids to follow along with. This is terrific program 
This program is simply the best kid's exercise video I've seen - PERIOD!!!! I usually don't write reviews, simple because most of the kid's fitness programs I've seen aren't worth the time to write about. But, Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, is completely different than anything I've ever seen. The film quality was very good, and the instructor did such a great job interacting with the kids, he's truly a natural with kids. One of the things I liked best about this program was the tempo flow, and the way the instructor just seemed to flow with the program. What I mean is, it didn't appear that he had memorized a script (of what to say) or that he was reading word for word from a script, he just went with the flow. And, any one of us who has ever worked with kids before knows that you have to be natural with kids in order to make it fun, anything less than that will effect the quality of what you're doing. - Now, don't get me wrong, this program was well rehearsed extremely well put together, but the instructor kids were truly going with the flow having fun. - Which is definitely more appealing to the kids watching the program. - Kids enjoy watching kids having fun, and if the kids on the program are having fun, then the kids watching want to participate so that they can have just as much fun. It doesn't get much simpler than this, unfortunately most programs have no understanding of this concept and fall way short. Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids is simply the best! Check it out, your kids will love it. 
One of the best movies I've seen. Everybody does a great job in portraying this sensitive material in a very real and gutsy way. I've seen this movie three times, I think, and each time have found it not only entertaining, but reminding that, as a society, we still have a lot of work to do on healing our human need for hatred and fear 
Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own. Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud. McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in. Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
Grisham once said he wrote his other books, e.g., The Firm, et al., so he could afford to write important books, like this one, upon which the movie s based. Matthew McConaghey gives a fantastic performance--and why hasn't Hollywood ever--EVER--given him another part this good! Thought provoking, great acting, great story, highly recommen 
If you like a movie with high sensual undertones and social overtones along with a surpising ending this is the movie for you. It really covers the bases with the ignorance of some of todays socialy idealistic organizations and the pain and distruction that they cause 
With a cast as strong as this one theres no wonder the film was a hit...I found myself wondering how they got all of these big ticket actors to sign onto the same film and then it hit me...this is most likely the film that launched a lot of their careers. The story is a brutally honest one about racism in Mississippi in the year 1995. A young black girl, ten years old, is raped and beaten by two white red-necks and when the young girls father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he's arrested and a trial is held. The film revolves around this mans lawyer mostly, Jake (McConaughey) as his family and practice is placed under fire by a newly reformed KKK as his home is scortched and his partners are harassed and his wife and child are forced to leave town for their safty. The film calls into account morality over law...whats right and wrong isn't always black and white and not so easily determined. Acting on all fronts is strong, but it's Jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through. Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock, Oliver Platt, Keifer Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd and Chris Cooper all give brilliant performances in this powerhouse of a film that benifits from a great script and a steller cast 
THis is one of my favorite movies. Besides containing a stellar cast (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Sammuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, DOnald AND Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey) You get the idea. Is there a cast member that ISN't a biggie? The casting is Genious, and the acting incredible. It's suspenseful, deep, VERY emotional.. slightly dark.. it's the perfect movie. Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you. A Time to kill's plot is pretty simply explained. In the deep south, a 10 year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks, who almost kill her. A young white lawyer and father (Matthew McConaughey as Jake Brigance) is sickened at the news, and doesn't quite know what to think when the little girl's father (Sammuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey) pays him a visit and asks if he'd "help him if he were in a tight spot". The next day as the two redneck/monsters are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment, Carl Lee Hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher. Jake Brigance agrees to defend Hailey as his murder trial begins. The insanity plea is used to "give the jury an excuse to aquit" But in my opinion, I think it was quite legitimate. What father WOULDN't be driven insane under the circumstances? the rest of the movie is Carl Lee Hailey's trial and the surrounding Drama as KKK violence emerges led by Kiefer Sutherland, and Jake's life and home are in danger, his relationship with his wife strained, and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle. My favorite scene? It might come as a surprise, but my favorite scene is when the Prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial. He was caught in the knee by a stray bullet, and now has half a leg. After the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against Carl Lee, and establish unerring identity of the shooter, The Defence asks him two questions. "Do you think Carl Lee intentionally shot you?" "No" "Do you think he should be sent to prision for what he did?" "He did what I would have done." but it doesn't end there as the Policeman (remember he's missing a leg because of what Carl Lee Hailey Did) becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like Carl Lee did. He starts screaming to the jury to "turn him loose, He's a hero!" I think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes (albeit there are many others too) (Great acting by Chris Cooper as the policeman) Anyway.. forgive if I rambled. I love this movie and if you like courtroom dramas... star studded casts.. John Grisham...suspense thrillers..just all around good movies.. You need to see this. 
Every writer is important. A writer that has views, characters, and exciting trial cases. This movie is originally based off of john grisim's first novel. A novel that he sturggled to get out there and then finally had it self-published. It's a powerful story that has a very dark setting. There's rascism, there's fights, there's deaths. Everything that this wolrd wants to avoid. I think samuel jackson played a really powerful performacne and I hope he got an oscar for this role. Just to warn you, though, that there are images in here that are hard to see. I , myself, fastforwarded one scene because I couldn't handle it. It's near the begining. But I hope you people enjoy the cast of characters and get captured by this huge story 
This is by far John Grisham's best books and movies of all. Although this was John's first book, it wasn't successful until one of more of his other books became successful. After the popularity of other books such as the firm this book hit the best sellers list. Then comes the subject of making this book into a movie. When John Grisham was foirst approached about turning it into a movie, he was somewhat reluctant because he felt the subject matter was to sensitive. He felt that without his input, the movie could not reflect what Grisham was trying to present in the book. After several of John Grisham's books were made into movies and were successful, I knew it was only a matter of time before "A Time To Kill" would be on the big screen. This movie is a great reflection of the book and maybe so because John Grisham had some influence over the production. The movie has an all star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, and Kevin Spacey. This movie is one of the best books turned into movies of the last thirty years. This DVD should be apart of everyone's movie collection. As this book will surely be a literary classic for hundreds of years to come, the movie will also be. 
John Grisham's powerful novel about persistent racial conflict in the South was transformed ten years ago into a gripping film by Joel Schumacher with the screenplay adaptation by Akiva Goldsman. The reporting of an act of violence by an African American father whose daughter had been kidnapped, brutally beaten, raped, and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony, even on a small scale, if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit. Matthew McConaughey is the rookie white lawyer, Ashley Judd his wife, Samuel Jackson the father, Sandra Bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists McConaughey, Kevin Spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing McConaughey, Oliver Platt as McConaughey's sidekick, Donald Sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help McConaughey find the truth justice knows, Patrick McGoohan as the implacable judge, and Kiefer Sutherland as the KKK redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town. It is a fine cast and Schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility. Perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'Great Movies', but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias. Recommended.

John Grisham's novel, "A Time to Kill" is closly adapted into a major motion picture by director Joel Schumacher. Rated "R" for language and violent content (including a scene dipicting the rape of a ten year old girl), the film contains not only strong content but strong performances from a number of "A" list stars. Samuel L. Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey, the father of the raped girl who takes out his revenge against the rapists by shooting them in cold blood as they are being escorted to their arraignment. Young and inexperienced local attorney, Jake Brigance (played by Matthew McConaughey in one of his first major roles) agrees to defend Carl Lee against the smarmey District Attroney Rufus Buckley (played by Kevin Spacey). Brigance is helped with the case by the unlikely trio of Sandra Bullock (playing a well-to-do law student), Oliver Platt (a morally devoid divorce attorney) and Donald Sutherland (a drunken disbarred lawyer who gave Brigance his first job). As the plot builds, the community begins to takes sides in the case. The KKK is called in to intimidate Carl Lee's defense team and the NAACP enters to counteract the Klan's actions. In some reviews, the film is panned as being poorly written and unbelieveable. This reviewer found the film fairly well done and true to the book. Without revealing any key plot details, let me suffice to say that the film is true to the novel and portrays the Deep South in a accurate way. There's plenty of action, few down moments and sparkling performances by a great cast! If you liked the book, you will enjoy "A Time to Kill". 
My three grandchildren (ages 5 through 10) love this DVD. They watch it in the van when they ride with me and are having so much fun learning the songs that they don't even think about how much they are learning 
I grew up with this, and now my 6 year old will have the opportunity to learn as I did. This was a kick to watch, for both of us, from start to finish. This would be a great gift for anyone who grew up in the 70s and 80s, and for their kids. The tune, "I'm only a bill...." is stuck in my head right now 
I really love this DVD. It's wonderful having all the 'rocks'in one place! You can play them linearly, or randomly, or by category. I'm enjoying the heck out of it ... and I'm almost sixty! (Supposedly I bought it for my autistic son. He loves it too. 
My son is 6 and I bought this for him to help him prep for 1st grade. He loves it and watches it every morning before school. He chooses to watch it over Nickelodeon and CN. After he watches one or two videos, we discuss them and later, we sing them. He has already learned heaps of math, grammar and US history. The latter is important because we live in Japan and I'm trying to see that he learns about his "other" nation. I also want to see him maintain his English as the school system pours more and more Japanese on him. School House Rock achieves all of these goals and more. The 2 disk set is also well-designed, with alot of extra animations. This is a must-have for any school-aged child, and as a GenX-er I never get tired of watching it, either. Solid, show-quality songs. Engaging, funny animation 
Another generation is now able to enjoy and learn 
Years ago, I used to watch Schoolhouse Rock with my children and recommended it to my students as well. Today, it is entertaining and educating the next generation of our family's youngsters. The Special 30th Anniversary Edition will be a treasure that parents and grandparents can enjoy with the kids. It's money well-spent 
This series of short videos is a great tool for parents to teach their kids various topics, English/Grammar, Math, How our form of Government (should) work, and History. I remember it well 
Finally, every one of the Schoolhouse Rock -- as well as a few I don't remember 
This is a good video for kids. It worked for me along time ago. I learned the preamble from this video and to this day if I need to recite the preamble I sing it. Not only the preamble, you learn spanish, bill to a law, conjunctions.... this video is timeless. If you have kids get this for them, makes at least the basics for 5 subjects in school easier for them 
For those of you whose children grew up with "Conjunction Junction" and other Grammar Rock songs, it is probably time for you to buy this DVD set for your grandkids! This collection has all of the songs that you remember (and probably some that you don't!) I recommend playing it on your computer for easier navigation to the videos that you want to see. I do not recommend downloading the software that comes with it. It was quite difficult to navigate. Simply use the media viewer that you already have installed on your computer. I really give this product 5 Stars; the 2 star rating was an accident that I can't remedy. 
Everyone in our family loves this movie. It's a great anytime movie 
If you don't own this dvd you need to add it to your collection. In my opinion it is the best american animated film ever released 
got it fast and my son was really happy. amazon is very reliable. i'm happy that i got it through them. keep up the good work 
If you are looking for a good movie to buy for your child, pass on this one. This movie has so many drug references, i can't even begin to explain.(trust me, I just so happen to have taken acid before) This is a movie that NEVER should have been directed toward children.  If you want your child to be drug free when he/she grows up, do not buy this 
Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland is one of my favorite animated films. Some great characters in this one, the smoking caterpillar, chesire cat, the queen of hearts, the mad hatter, and of course that busy White Rabbit. Alice in Wonderland is such a sweet, sensitive and quite risque film, clearly the caterpillar isn't smoking incense but this film is classic, I love it so much. I can't wait til my nephew starts watching this film. Other Disney films I enjoy include: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, and The Lady and the Tramp. I highly recommend Alice in Wonderland, could this movie be any better? I think not 
Disney's "Alice in Wonderland" is one of their most underrated animated masterpieces that finally gets the 2 disc special edition treatment that it so very much deserves. The animation is pleasing to the eyes, the songs are pleasing to the ears, and Alice's adventures are charming and interesting to behold. The classic childhood story written my Lewis Carroll, is given a brilliant boost with great animated characters that bring Alice's adventures to glorious life. Kathryn Beaumont give's Alice a voice that is so sincere with each amazing discovery in the Land of Wonder, so that the character seems more real than simply animated. Kathryn also does a great job as the voice for Wendy in Disney's "Peter Pan." This dvd release is loaded with tons of extras that are very enjoyable to watch. I especially like the Walt Disney tv special, starring Kathryn Beaumont and Bobby Driscoll (Treasure Island) that introduces "Alice in Wonderland" to the public and features excerpts from "Song of the South" and other Disney films. I highly recommend "Alice in Wonderland : The Masterpiece Edition" to fans of classic Disney animated films and to fans of animated childhood stories and fantasies. "Alice in Wonderland" is a beautiful daydream that definitely should not be missed 
Not only does this film was exquisitely made for a different audience by Disney, but they were able to capture the real message implicitly stated in Carrol's book; here, we are able to succumb into the fantastic wonderlands brought upon by psychedelics, and more often than not, one is constantly reminded about the useless games and parodies we set ourselves with on a daily basis. Alice realizes that something has happened, but is not able to handle all this nonsense, which in fact are just a product of her own mind. Most importantly, I believe, is to watch this film under a preferred state of consciousness as to better appreciate the subtle messages the producers wanted to put across, and luckily, by the end of the film, you can ask yourself: Who am I? 
There's certain sequences in Disney films that are so memorable they tend to get parodied or they're referenced more than the actual movie. The spaghetti scene in Lady and the Tramp. Bambi's mother in that movie, or the pink elephant scene in Dumbo are examples of scenes that are just as memorable as the films. So it's odd that so many of Alice's scenes are pop culture even when it didn't have the warmest welcome on release. Granted we're not talking Disney's masterpiece level but still, it's quite a quirky movie. Alice is receiving lessons when she sees the reflection of a rabbit in the water. She follows it and stumbles down a long hole and enters the world of Wonderland. She ends up seeing a long list of quirky situations including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts, talking flowers and the White Rabbit. Even though it's a film unto itself, many of its scenes are referenced in other films are they're just pop culture iconic scenes. And of course the Matrix brought it back by using the rabbit hole and white rabbit imagery. The film however didn't get the biggest response as people were confused by it and found it odd. It's even written Walt himself apologized for it although it became popular after it was on a television show edited down. This is probably the most atypical film Disney's released, although other films such as Emperor's New Groove or Atlantis are quite different. While those 2 were pretty devoid of characters breaking out into song, Alice has a bunch of songs. The imagery of course is odd as we get walking pencils, talking flowers, tears turning into raging waters and a cat who has a habit of disappearing. You can obviously tell why critics couldn't understand it. It's still cited as one of Disney's more better "smart" films such as Fantasia. You should check it out? Of course but word of caution: by no means are you going to see a quintessential Disney classic but still you'll probably like it and enjoy it...probably 
i loved this movie-it is a thinkers movie-not fluff or gore 
I was very pleasantly surprised at this film. Denzel Washington proves again that he can handle any role that he chooses to play. In this case, he plays homicide inspector, Lincoln Rhyme who has been nearly paralyzed after suffering from an accident in the line of duty. But now, when a mysterious killer begins killing off people in a very peculiar matter, he must team with a hard-headed rookie cop (Angelina Jolie) to solve the crimes. Supporting cast includes Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, Mike McGlone, Luis Guzman, Leland Orser and Ed O'Neil. I like the way they have the killer as an intelligent person. Someone who has a knowledge of what he is doing. And the way he leaves clues for the cops to follow. To come up with something this perfect, you must a genius. While not really scary, this suspense thriller is actually thrilling as opposed to the many number of "thrillers" that are not even thrilling. (Example: HANGMAN). Thank you Hollywood for giving us THE BONE COLLECTOR. This is a good one. Highly recommended.....5/ 
Philip Noyce is a very smart filmmaker. And once more he confirms it through this intense and intriguing psychological picture around a notable expert forensic (Denzel Washington) sadly a bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces with a witty female agent (Angelina Jollie) to intend by all their means to get a mysterious serial killer around the low belly of NYC. Smart clues, notable shots, first rate direction, kinetic script make of this movie one of the five most solid thrillers in the Nineties according the tradition of Silence of the lambs as well as an underneath homage to "The rear window", if you carefully establish the visible connections, due if James Stewart was a visible peeping tom at those times, Denzel Washington is the scrutinizing cyber eye. The paradigm remains, and just the form changes. Highly recommended. 
Very interested and keeps you on the 'edge' thru the entire movie! 
Denzel Washington is great but Angelina Jolie he is even better. The movie itself is pretty scary, to tell you the truth it's not pleasant. There are some parts you don't really need to see. The plot of the movie is interesting and keeps you wondering what is gonna happen next. I recommend watching it with somebody, cause it's not pretty. But it's a good movie. 
Bone Collector Upon the opening scene of the movie, I was highly upset. It was only after the movie had begun that I realized I didn't buy a porn. C'mon! Bone Collector!? That was a clever little marketing ruse you did there Universal. Nice one. You won't get me again. It's a psycho-sexual thriller, with Angelina Jolie hitting on a genius gimp who has a knack for riddles, nuts and bolts, and jigsaw puzzles. This guy is so smart he could probably beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy. He even has an awesome, magical straw that controls one of those Tempur-pedic beds. He can make the bed recline with a magic straw!! Unfortunately, he didn't do the bowling ball and wine glass trick. Together with the gimp and his incredible pull within the police force that he is no longer a member of, Jolie (who is transferred from to homicide because she used a dollar bill to measure something) begins to unscramble the riddle of corpses, clues, comic books, and ancient steam pipes, leading to a super-duper surprise hunky-dory ending in which everything is perfect, and butterflies land on retarded kids' heads. Only, there are a few major plot-holes: 1) There is no way that Jolie would have switched departments. 2) There is no way that Washington would have had that much pull. 3) There is no way the serial killer would have left all the clues when he could just go for his main target to begin with. 4) The clues that are so cleverly figured out don't even lead to figuring out who the killer is. Things learned from this movie: -Ed O'Neill is more versatile than the Al Bundy role. -Make sure to never get into a cap driven by other than an Arab guy. -I hate the fact that Queen Latifah, a person as talented as a stick of butter, has somehow managed to squeeze into a small sliver of celebrity. The fifteen minutes have been over for quite some time now. Leave. In the end it's a mediocre movie from which I expected more. Given the combo of Washington and Jolie, there really should have been greatness. It's a preposterous renter at best 
This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it. Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel. And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure?????? Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later? I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project. 
I really enjoy the House of Elliot. The series starts off well with two sisters going into the dress-making business and opening up their own successful shop. Season 2 ditches some of the old villains (the scheming relatives) and introduces a French designer and a banker as the antagonist/s of the season. Again, as with the first series, I like the character Bea a bit more than I like Evie. Evie's antics don't really excite me that much. She seems the more selfish and inconsiderate of the two. I also don't find myself enraptured by the Jack/Bea romance. While I enjoy both characters individually, I see Bea as too independent to settle down and become the perfect wife. Also, I don't really care that much about the film industry, so watching Jack 'on the job' doesn't hold that much appeal. Still, this was a solid season and its nice to see the sisters be successful for once 
Any word on if/when Series 4 of The House of Eliott will be released on DVD? I, too, found the last episode of Series 3 to be quite a cliff-hanger and I would surely be looking forward to seeing what happens to Jack in Parliament as well as how Evie will fight for her couturier part in the design house. Any word would be appreciated 
I thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of the House of Eliott. The acting was fantastic, the dresses magnificent and the locations, as with most English mini-series, marvelous. My only complaint is that it doesn't end!! THere is no closure to this. As you approach the last chapter of Season 3 you start to wonder how they are going to wrap it all up in the little time that is left, and - oh surprise! - things are left unsettled and you feel that you need one more season to see how things worked out for everyone! Is there any chance that there is a Season 4 out there somewhere???? 
I greatly enjoyed both Series 1 and 2. The costumes are spectular. The plot can be a little tedious at times, but there is an impressive cast of different characters coming and going throughout the series. It's also pleasantly predictable, so a lot of fun. My only complaint is that the last episode is a mild cliff hanger, and later episodes aren't available. My compliments to amazon.com for carrying these reviews. It was the only place I found that indicated that there are more episodes to come on DVD. Not even the BBC.UK website provided that information! Thanks, Amazon and volunteer reviewers 
I rediscovered this after a long time. This is a great series.I had never seen this in its entirety and look forward to seeing the third and fourth which I understand is not out yet.Its a gem, love the storyline and costumes.,so authentic looking and of the period,even the dialogue.I wish there were more of this genre 
wonderful series,hope they bring out the third one soon,loved i 
Hilarious from beginning to end! Dr. Pearl er Eugene Levy, will you marry me???? 
Yes, it is that funny. The humor in this film alternates between exceedingly subtle and understated to borderline farce in a worthy successor of Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL TAP, in which Christopher Guest costarred, and predecessor to Guest's later masterpieces BEST IN SHOW and A MIGHTY WIND. Reiner in his film created the mockumentary comedy genre, in which characters largely ad libbed their parts while everything was filmed as if it were a documentary. Guest has in three films now masterfully emulated Reiner's style, assembling a group of actors he prefers to use over and again. Almost all of the central actors have appeared in two or more of these films and several in all three. Unless one prefers dumbed-down slapstick, this is comedy just about as funny as it comes. The first time I saw it I don't think I really caught on until the scene where Blaine, Missouri's (the film was actually filmed in Texas) town historian recounted how Blaine was founded after wagon train leader Blaine Fabin mistakenly told the settlers that they were in California near the Pacific when in fact they were in Missouri. The plot is rather simple. In honor of the 150th anniversary of Blaine's inadvertent founding, a day of celebration is being held that will be capped by a locally written and produced musical revue. Corky St. Clair, an obviously gay theater person who has fled New York for the small town, takes on the challenge of directing. The bulk of the movie consists of auditions, rehearsals, and the final performance of the musical. The title stems from the hope that a Mr. Guffman of a New York theatrical company will be in attendance. This film was literally made up as they went along. My understanding is that they ended up with dozens of hours of footage out of which Guest had to craft a final film. While move films are refined in the editing phase, this one is unique for being created at that stage. Because most of the dialogue is made up as the cameras roll, a film like this takes a special cast of actors. Veterans of improv like Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy and stand ups such as Fred Willard are to be expected, but what is so great is how people you wouldn't automatically think would excel in the form, such as the always delightful Parker Posey, do so. By way of trivia, the part of the play's narrator is played by Lewis Arquette, son of Cliff Arquette and father of all those other Arquettes, including Rosanna, Patricia, and David. And I'm sure all ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fans will love the UFO expert, played by none other than Tobias himself, David Cross (famed himself for ad libbing many of his lines on that show). One of the best jokes in the movie occurs in a "Three Months Later" coda that finds out where the principal performers in the musical have ended up. Corky is back in New York, hoping for tryouts (perhaps as Henry Higgins in a revival of MY FAIR LADY). The joke comes when we find out he is running a Hollywood memorabilia store, where one of the hottest items is a MY DINNER WITH ANDRE action figure set. For those who haven't seen the film, the only thing that happens in the entirety of the movie is Wallace and Andre talk while seated in a restaurant. I've learned the hard way that this and Guest's other films aren't for everybody. Not everyone seems to "get" them. This astonishes me since I find these films funnier than anything else coming out of Hollywood these days. But for whatever reason, so people are not capacitated for some reason to enjoy them. But for those who are, these films are priceless gems 
Apparently this is one of those "cult" movies that has a small but dedicated following, even though most people have never heard of it. Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that the reviews you'll read here are from a VERY skewed sample of movie fans. I love good comedy, and so does my wife, but both of us found this movie terminally dull. It's basically a one-joke movie -- the joke being that the people in it (the characters, not the actors) are totally untalented, but also totally oblivious to that fact. So they just keep on doing their unfunny bits. "Waiting for Guffman" does not appear on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies. Nor is it on the IMDB list of 50 Top Comedies, as rated by thousands of movie fans. So anyone who tells you this movie is the "funniest movie ever" or "hilarious" is definitely out of the mainstream. I'll give Guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path. The improv/mockumentary format has the potential to be funny, but in this mess of a movie, it doesn't work very well. There are some funny bits (David Cross is always a stitch) but too much of it just falls flat. It feels like something that would have worked on SNL as a 10-minute sketch, but as a full-length movie it just CRAWLS. OK, I've said my piece -- and I'm sure that I'll get lots of "not helpful" ratings from the movie's rabid fans who make up the majority of the folks that will check out this title. But if you're not a fan of slow, dry, improvisational movies, be warned: you won't find "Waiting for Guffman" very amusing 
This is a really great and hilarious movie. If you're a Christopher Guest fan, and you like "Spinal Tap" and "A Mighty Wind", you'll love this one as well. It's got a lot of the same people that are always in his movies, like Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, and they're all always great together. Also, David Cross is hilarious as the UFO nut. Definitely buy this movie. And don't forget to pick up a "Remains of the Day" lunchbox while you're at it 
If you have ever been involved in any sort of community or college theater, you have GOT to see this film. There is great truth in this fiction 
Waiting for Guffman is an awesomely funny movie! It's shot just like a low cost documentary would be shot - awkward transitions, bumbling soliloquies and strange zoom action. The characters are wonderful. Guest got everything just right from the travel agent wearing white athletic socks with his loafers to the over-exuberant Blaine Community Players. The movie was full of slapstick humor along with witty, thoughtful humor as well. What's great about this movie as well is that you're not just laughing at the characters, you're getting excited about the Blaine Sesquecentennial right along with them! The songs are catchy (in a frighteningly annoying kind of way), and you find yourself tapping your foot along with the song and dance review. If you have seen other Guest movies, I would say this one ranks in the middle for me (Best in Show is my favorite, Waiting for Guffman, then A Mighty Wind). I think this one captured the excitement and hilarity of small-town pride and revelry. Loved it! Favorite line: "I hate you, you... bastard people... You're all bastard people! 
This movie is just plain hilarious. If you have ever known people who fancy themselves members of the creative elite BUY THIS DVD. The endless laughs will make up for all the suffering pretentious types have ever put you through. That's a bargain at any price 
Having known a few people who fancy themselves as creative types , it was a fun experience to watch this . One could argue that this misguided feeling that people have is one of the main concerns of Christopher Guest - it may be a limited view of people , but it is also a predominant problem for most of us . I would feel confident in saying that many of us have had to deal with a colleague who thinks they are wonderful . I don't mind that so much . For me , the problem comes when those types are put in charge of a group of people . This film can be seen as a comedy or as a good example of putting together a group of people who are more than a little self-centred . You will see the psychological game playing going on . It is a film for anyone who has ever been involved with amateur dramatics , or amateur anything . You will notice that Mr Guest has made a number of other films like this and they are all entertaining . I encourage you to see them all for the characters - the rich tapestry of humanity we all deal with every day 
I think that for a first time writer/director Vanessa did a great job. The story is based on her real family to some extent and the town she grew up in, which is VERY similar to the film and the movie was filmed there as well. It's a movie about family like nobody could ever imagine. This family is real, and i know them all because they are my family as well. Others say this family is impossible to exist but THEY DO......slightly less dramatic but its all there. I think it's great 
Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional. Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her. Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers. I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents. These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up. The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs. I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much. He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her. I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like Hemingway. In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately. There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature. 
Character studies of dysfunctional families is a fairly common comedy device. However, in most such efforts, there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones. We found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters. Even the bride (who is supposed to carry the film) seemed fake and unlikeable. We watched about 20 minutes of this DVD and ditched it in favor of something else. For a much better "quirky family" movie, wait for "The Family Stone" to come out on DVD 
This is how that "Greek Wedding" movie should have been done! Its sweet without being schmaltzie. Its gritty without losing heart. I like to think of this film as that "other wedding film" on ecstasy (in a very flattering way). It was written, produced, directed, and starred the very talented Vanessa Parise. Keep your eye on this young woman folks, she is going places 
Sibling rivalry. An overbearing father. Great Italian food. Small town versus big city life. Family bonds. Life choices. Handsome men. Four beautiful sisters. So much to relate to. Emotional, fun and definitely worth buying 
I laughed, I cried. So entertaining -- loved it. We need more movies like this one. I want to see it on the big screen 
I thought this was a chick flick but i actually really liked it 
I'm usually not into reality tv shows (never watched one for more than one episode) however, when i started watching the apprentice i immediately became addicted to it. It is by far the best reality show ever created. Not only its entertaining but most importantly, its educational. It gives the viewers a chance to see and experience secondhand many aspects of many types of businesses and how people from different backgrounds work together (or not)... Also, Trump shares so much of his knowledge in doing business that just those insights are enough reason to buy this dvd... Highly recommended! 
I bought this product for a business training program. Many of our associates where not aware of the winner and what his business message offers. This product was great as a learning tool with an added bonus of "no commercials" 
The Apprentice Season 5 is being shown on Hong Kong TV each Monday and I can't believe both my 15-year-old son and I have arranged our social schedules around this one-hr TV show on Monday evening. We are absolutely hooked on it and can hardly wait for the next episode. Why does it take so long for Season 2,3 and 4 to come out in DVD? This is an ideal gift for anyone with good taste for a good TV serial. 
'The Apprentice' should hardly be evaluated as the underdog of reality television. Slickly, but sharply presented, it provided a petri dish of capitalism with the drama that can't fail to enthrall a NYSE broker or an unfamiliar novice. The elements are assembled expertly by 'Survivor' creator, Mark Burnett, and The Donald. Editing certainly was one of the main ingredients of success, but the candidates are captivating enough to make season one an absorbing serial drama. Alumni Bill Rancic in his autobiographical business memoir, called 'The Apprentice,' a game show. Deference should be showed for his evaluation, but they could have fooled us. It seems more like a simulation. Season one comes together serendipitously for three reasons: the task, taskmaster, and the takers. Mystery pervades every episode with a colorful group of contestants, an assignment with a different business aspect provided, and an elimination round that is suspenseful and skillfully prepared. (What will they have to do? How will they get their act together? Who will get fired?) Then, in the middle of the episode, The Donald has a cameo appearance where he expounds on the business lesson or principal, usually highlighting a contestant's later actions. It could have come across as a schmaltzy business lesson, but his folksy, no-nonsense lecture becomes an illuminating intermission. Season one works well for the cast of characters. (And, as contestants, there are plenty here!) The first season was not just successful because of viewer curiosity, it worked because the first group had less talent and accumen and more heart and colorful personalities overall. There was a savvy, charismatic businesswoman from Texas (Amy), a colorful cowboy from Boise (Troy), a brash, but spunky New Yorker (Heidi), a smooth and learned broker (Kwame), and a calm and hard-working entrepreneur from Chicago (Bill) just to name a few. The serial drama seems genuine and not forced. (The premise contained risks that could have been a disaster.) The plot thickened with alliances that were made and broken, but more interesting was the love interest of Amy and Nick. Both the couple and the producers captured the relationship in a way to keep it from overtaking the main story, but the presentation kept us guessing whether it was genuine love or a ploy at office politics. Furthermore, a villain was added to the mix. Omarossa Manigault-Stallworth--forgive me for the misspelling!--formerly worked for the Clinton administration and had the political skills to throw a wrench into everything. She wasn't rationalizing when she said she was way too creative to take a job with Donald Trump. On 'The Apprentice' website, she wrote that never was so much good come from being so bad. (It turns out that she's had the most follow-up stories. An aspiring actress, she's been successful for Halle Berry's 'Catwoman' and a UPN soap opera. Maybe she was grooming to be the next Erica Caine/Susan Lucci all along. In a recent book, Trump himself called her "the most articulate" of all the first year contestants. I thought the same, but have to give him the credit.) Not to spoil discoveries with details, but Nick's honesty and chauvenism, Amy's perfectionism, and Heidi's family drama are just a few developments added to keep our interest. Seldom have people on a reality show been more endearing than with this ensemble. Upon the debut, we all became armchair quarterbacks, calling them out for dumb plays and wrongly calling out the Donald for some executive decisions. (When he fired Omarossa, I thought he did it at the worst time, when she was at her finest form and the only one on her team to produce. However, results are everything. He didn't get to be a billionaire for bad judgment! To rephrase 'SNL', "He's The Donald. And You're NOT!") And, that's where the success falls apart. Sam correctly distinguished the difference between good candidacy and good television with his 'Apprentice' website commentary. To paraphrase, a good strategy and engaging television can often come at cross-purposes. True to himself, after season one Donald Trump showcased bigger clients with bigger prizes and candidates with far better resumes. The result was a feeding frenzy. Later seasons fostered business accumen like never before and aspiring starlets mugging for the camera. The professionals devoured the latter. Stacy J., for instance, was unfairly eliminated early and accused of lunacy for her vibrant, cheerleading sensibilities. If the catclaws were apparent season one, they at least managed to put them away in time to win against the men! Season two was bloody. After season one the tasks were bigger but didn't showcase specific designated skills (like negotiating) for each week with each new task. The later simulations often failed to surprise. Later, it was harder to like the candidates. Trump's admirable genuineness created, but later killed, the show.  
I Live in Thailand I Dont get any American TV Programs Here so I watch a lot of TV Shows on DVD I either get from friends or buy on-line. As for this Review The Apprentice is a Great Reality show. I Have Watched it over and Over again. My Only Comment is when will the rest of the Apprentice seasons come out on DVD for purshase. It is a Shame thier is only the 1st Season out for sale. Please send me an e-mail if any future Seasons of the Apperentice do become availible on DVD thank you, Thomas Lentin 
I had a great time watching the first season via this DVD set. I have seen the last two seasons and loved them but I had never seen the first season. I thought I'd get this to see how it was and I wanted to see how the first winner was, (while being a candidate). I have to say that it was amazing. I loved the whole series. The candidates were very unique and entertaining to watch. Even Mr. Trump is a little more laid back in this season than others. The bonus disk is also very fun. It has more info on the candidates, a music video, deleted scenes, career advice from Trump's advisors George and Carolyn, an exclusive sneak peak of season 2, "Donald-isms", unseen footage from the ending title taxi rides, new interviews with Donald Trump and the contestants, and creator Mark Burnett on The Apprentice. A lot to offer, really. I really recommend this set to those who like reality shows (like survivor). Even if you haven't seen the first season, or even if you haven't seen any of the seasons. This is really a great set. I hope to see the second season on DVD soon. --M.Turcott 
I've had a lot of experience as a 'project manager' and it doesn't quite resemble the show's job description. First and foremost this is a tv show where none of the women are overweight and are above average looking. The men are allowed to be average looking. Season one is by far the best. After that the show has just repeated itself and has not shown enough creative projects to keep it compelling. The personalities are the stars. Omorosa is not a capable worker but manages to inflate her abilities. No wonder she couldn't keep a government job. My sister saw the season finale with me but didn't see the other episodes. She asked what was wrong with that woman. So true, there's no way Omorosa should have a position with responsibility. Lucily Amy is intelligent enough to keep the show from filling it with so so business women who are of course attractive. Kwame and Bill could have easily won and would have done well at the job. They didn't attack each others personalities, but tried to play up their strengths. After the 1st season it became the 'street vendor show' and then the 'create a marketing campaign for a large company.' By the second season many candidates were fired for the wrong reasons. The 1st season had more logic behind the firings. 
I didn't start watching The Apprentice until the second season. Now I am a big fan of the show, and I look forward to each new season. I bought the Season One DVD set awhile ago, and love it! I just wish that they would now release the rest of the seasons! Trump gives great tips, that are highlighted during different times in the shows, and I always look forward to what he will say next. As successful as he is, he's definitely worth listening to! You might think that a reality show like this would get boring over time, but this one still manages to keep us watching...and loving it! Not only is The Apprentice entertaining, but you can learn a lot from the show. 
I bought this DVD and IT WAS THE BEST! The only thing I don't like is they are playing for a job 
I never watched the Apprentice when it was on TV. I thought I wouldn't like it because I am not into business or Donald Trump. But I ended-up checking it out from my library just to see what the big stink was about, and I was HOOKED! I watched it all weekend, one episode after the other. I had to know what happened! I loved the challenges given to the contestants - it was fun to see how they would work through them. Plus there is plenty of personal conflict and drama. GREAT show 
Frank Oz directs the best Steve Martin movies. While Michael Caine is a reliably excellent presence in most if not all of the movies he appears in, Martin (in my opinion) is uneven and all too often relies on shtick. Oz seems to bring out the best...or makes best use of the worse...in Martin's bag of tricks. Bowfinger is further evidence of this. We've (husband, wife and three kids) have seen this movie too many times to count and yet quite a few scenes never fail to make us laugh. The scene of Caine posing as famed Medical specialist testing Martin's feigned psychosomatic paralysis is priceless. 
This one has it all - an inspired script (Lady Fanny of Omaha?) based on a clever premise, an opportunity for Steve Martin to work a full range of schticks (including a very earnest, "don't pity me, you don't have to do that" ruse), a richly-photographed Riviera backdrop and a stylish jazz violin score by the late Miles Goodman. Of special note is Michael Caine's wonderful man-about-town, a role that would have been tailor-made (pun intended) for the late David Niven and executed to perfection by Caine, who is at the top of his form here. Caine and Martin playing cat-and-mouse with one another is great fun. And, oh yes, there's that over-the-top segment about Ruprecht that a friend and I have bantered about for years. Top-notch entertainment. 
So many hysterical scenes that make everyone I watch it with laugh. The ending is one that I can only aspire too, and I can't give it away! However, I will say that watching con artists con eachother is on par with watching Josh Holloway trying to portray "Sawyer" his con-artist through the TV series Lost. Enjoy 
This movie will make you laugh from beginning to end! I have watched it several times and still laugh out loud. Highly recommeded for fans of Michael Cane and Steve Martin 
"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a classic comedy, driven from beginning to end by the crafty characters created by Michael Caine and Steve Martin. The storyline has been addressed extensively by other reviewers, but I will add that this film definitely breaks Mom's old rule: "don't make fun of the handicapped." Not only are Martin and Caine's characters both morally handicapped in the extreme, but Martin gets to play not one but two handicapped characters as he works his cons: one is in a wheelchair, and the other (Ruprecht)....well, I don't know exactly what Ruprecht's handicap is, but I can understand why he's kept locked up in his room. Finally, this movie has a lovely look to it, allowing you to take a fantasy trip to the French Riviera, stay in the finest hotels and villas, and sip the best champagne - that's a step up from most movies these days right there. No explosions or violence. Amazing. 
For me, this film works because of Michael Caine. It is his style and strong characterization as Lawrence Jamieson that holds the film together and allows Steve Martin to riff with his role as the crass Freddie Benson. The film takes some chances and not everything works and some of it seems as if it belongs in another film, but part of the key to this film is to distract you so you don't really suspect what is happening until the end. Glenne Headly is very nice as Janet Colgate, the object of a bet between the over confident con men. Lawrence and Freddie are so sure of themselves that the loser is willing to leave town because each believes the other one is the loser. However, Caine's character, Jamieson, begins to have pangs about treating such an innocent so callously. Freddie, Steve Martin's more crass con man, has his own misgivings, as well. There are several really well done supporting roles, but the movie is really about these three and how Caine and Martin begin working together and end up competing. One of the finest bits in the movie is when Caine is trying to teach Martin the social graces of a gentleman con man. Frank Oz did a good job with this movie. Some might say that he let too much of Martin's shtick into the movie, but I think it serves its important purpose of misdirection. And much as Jim Carrey today, Martin was quite hot then and audiences had certain expectations for him. And the bits are funny in a way that also induces a bit of queasiness, but funny nonetheless. Watching the movie nowadays, while I still enjoy Martin's performance, I really enjoy Caine's more and notice Headly a bit more than I did the first time through 
This is outright hilarious. I admit I haven't seen the original version, but this one is fantastic. It's choc full of witty and intelligent humour and it's well acted too. Back in the day when I first saw this, I didn't see the ending coming. Who would have guessed. Without giving anything away, in a nutshell Steve Martin and Michael Caine compete to see who can swindle a set amount of dollars off a particular lady first. It's a riot watching these two act out bizzare plots just to win the cash. You must see this - you will be in stitches 
Laurence Jameson (Caine) is a con-man, hustling rich corupt women out of thousands by lies and decept. Freddy Benson is also a con-man, hustling your average everyday woman out of a meal or two here and there...but when the two of them end up in the same place at the same time they realize they have competition, and when Freddy realizes how much Laurence really makes off these women, well, he wants just as much. The two decide to work together resulting in one of the funniest chain of events in movie history...whether Martin is playing Ruprecht (the monkey boy) or Officer Benson, the man crippled by memories of his fiance dancing naked with the host of Dance America, Martin is absolutly histarical. Caine has a dry humor that works well when bouced off of Martins charisma. I'm not a Caine fan but here he works well and casting can be forgiven since the script is tight and yes, Martin is brilliant. Highly recomended...this will make you laugh out loud and Ruprecht will make you laugh so hard you will cry 
Laurence Jamieson (Michael Caine) is a sophisticated confidence man that has be praying on the Riviera so long that he is even in the good graces of the local law enforcement. He crosses paths with an other "Dirty Rotten Scoundrel" Fred Benson (Steve Martin) who is more on the nickel and dime level. After a fails attempt to shake Fred off Laurence decides to shape him up. Thy have to compete against the unknown predator only known as the jackal. Can Fred learn the finer points of relieving people of their monetary endowment? Or will everyone fall prey to the jackal? They could not have picked better people for the parts as the actors seem to have put a lot of their own personalities into the roles. 
Great movie. It is a must to have in your dvd collection. Some scenes in the movie are hillarious. you laugh until you have tears in your eyes. an interesting comparison of the American and European culture. the twist at the end incredible. Do not miss this movie. 
This movie is a must have for all family libraries. It appeals to adults and youth alike. A true feel-good movie about how we are all the same inside, no matter what our outward differences are. Really teaches the lesson, "Don't judge a book by its cover". 
I bought this movie for my coming of age daughter to watch with me. I enjoyed it so much in high school and was not surprised that she did also. Times and styles may have changed, but I believe that teens still go through needing the sense of belonging as these teens in the movie did. Simple, but great movie. My only regret is that it wasn't close captioned 
I dont know what its like to have gone to school in the 1980's or have gone to school in the United States but I can still relate to this movie. This movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story, only fashion and accessories would be different. Everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie. I would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now. It may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times, but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie. It gains momentum as it moves along and by the end, after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied. Being a small cast, all your attention is focused on the individual characters. The 5 students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant. Each actor plays their part perfectly. While there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons. They will all probably be most remembered for this movie, with the exception of Emilio Estevez, but special mention must go to Judd Nelson who I believe is the biggest star of the film. His part was originally intended for either Nicholas Cage or John Cusack who would have also been great, but I'm glad Judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities. It is a shame the DVD lacks many special features. All you get is a trailer and cast bios, I was desperately seeking an audio commentary, or at the very least production notes, however there are some interesting facts noted on IMDB. A teen movie for the 80's generation, anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it, but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic. 7.5/1 
This movie is all about character development of people who are all drastically different. This is a comming of age film for the 1980's. The acting is wonderful. It is a different style of movie. There were some really great movies comming out then. Ferris Beulers Day off, Pretty in Pink and some kind of wonderful. This is another one. It is a classic of the time period for the people comming of age durning this time. The 1980's is a time I was fond of. I do not find it tacky as the media is right now. This movie is funny. Some of these classics get refered to in other movies. You might want to watch it 
The Breakfast Club, one of the best movies out there. Timless no matter what's your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie! :- 
Smooth and easy transaction - my daughters thank you, too 
John Hughes strikes gold with this hit classic.This film is about five kids who show at their high school for Saturday detention.While there,they open up to each other and express their feelings,putting up with each other and evading their wily principal(Paul Gleason).High-strung humor and laughs blend with superb storytelling as The Breakfast Club(Starring Judd Nelson as Bender,Molly Ringwald as Claire,Ally Sheedy as Allison,Anthony Michael Hall as Brian,and Emilio Estevenz as Andrew)are hillarious!A pleasant all-around film 
I love John Hughes and I love the brat pack, and I have to say this movie is WAY better than all of the others. And it's not just those who graduated in the 80s who haven't seen this movie who're locked in a cave, but ANYONE who has not seen Club is culturally deprived and should seek help imediately 
could you say me if there is french subtitles in this DVD!? thank you! Lil 
Since "ER" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's taken the nation by storm. It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton, a former surgeon before his writing career. For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television. The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton). It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys. Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode. Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes. Season one introduces the everyday life in the ER in Chicago. Throughout, it explores many critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others. Regular show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997), Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many others. Such combination shows partially how the show's theme evolved to today. Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on top. The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience. Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official cast member until season 3). This season explores Ross's most heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being forced to care for her neice, and many more. Today's viewers who haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism, Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle), and others. This plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season. It continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama. Both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast. All add their own sense of individual theme into every scene. Through personal struggles, drama, and continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor. Such show quality makes "ER - The Complete First Two Seasons" worthy for all fans. This is sure to please its audiences. New viewers should watch these two seasons first. Otherwise, the plot will be confusing. Fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future 
The Crow (Collector's Series Boxed Set) consists of the first three of four in the series. Although all three have the same theme, each is quite different and exciting 
The trio of The Crow films (yes, I enjoyed The Crow City Of Angels much as I enjoyed the first and the third) are unique by their own right, using brilliant cinematography to edge out the difference between them: The first, black and white homage to the graphic novels, with little pints of color; The second, sickly-greenish colors but somewhat interesting, as it shows us an ill-ridden type of a city much needing an angel guarding it; and the lively-yet-dark third movie, to show us real life tale of cruel justice gone bad. In each tale, The Crow is adapted quickly to his poor circumstances and finds his strength in the one true link to his former love (In the second, its the one true pure soul left in the city, Sarah), and badder-than-ever villains. Brandon Lee's performance will become (if not already) legendary, and I refer to his DVD interview to emphasis its greatness ("because we do not know when we will die, we think of life as an inexhaustable well" will suffice with all the irony that goes along with it). These three are classics, not to be confused with the fourth, which has less impact, since it tries too hard to be original, yet looses something along the way in terms of casting, acting, and cinematography, as the desert-themed atmosphere hasn't worked that well. Should have used more of that "grittier" feel to the scenes (like the four horsemen's introduction scenes), if you ask me. Having read Poppy Z. Brite's "The Crow: The Lazarus Heart", I found it more suitable for an on-screen adaptation, and thinking of it as taking The Crow in more nastier ways than ever before. But by using the first three films success in doing a B-rated sequels, it will take a miracle for these movies from becoming a laughing-stock 
this is great..i love the crow movies especially the first one...it rocks this box set rocks ..and the ppl who created it rock too 
The first with Brandon Lee is a blast, as always. I am not sure why everyone is so upset over the second one. After all Eric and Shelly are refured to...by SARAH. The second movie contiues with Sarah's story. I dont know why, but most people miss that. The third? Well, I just got my set...and have not gotten to it yet. But I expect it to be just as good 
The first film is fantastic,and so are the others.I feel that their based on about a persons feelings of pain in life and it's effects on their emotions of their everyday lives that maybe a constant strugle even for victims of past abuse or trauma's.I mean that literly that when a person young or mid age watches these movies,I personly feel that they can strongly relate to such things within these movies.Weather their good or bad.Because honestly about these movies they somewhat have a true meaning and purpose in life as we know it,for the simple fact that some of the tragies in these movies could very well happen to us if you think honestly think about it.Even if it's just a movie.And, last,but not least the remarkable thing i like about this series so much is when a important person dies,that they can be given a 2nd chance at life by resurrection of the crow to do a rightful deed of justice in return to go to heaven for destroying evil that was done to a innocent person or themselves.I BELIEVE IT'S A ACT OF FAITH.. 
The second and third films are basically garbage. If THE CROW, directed by Proyas is the standard, then the rest are so far separated, that they fall into Oblivion. The tale as played by Brandon Lee works on just so many levels, and is in my view , one of the best films about Justice for victims. I have a number of versions of the CROW on VHS and DVD, and the Extras on the triple pack fail in one respect; there is an interview with Lee on the VHS version that is without a doubt, one of the most poignant, touching, and eerily prescient interviews on tape. Lee talks about how we think it is all so limitless, and yet... how many times will we see the Moonrise, how many times will the things we love happen, in other words, the moments we have are precious... it is not that he was preaching some sort of live for the now moment, but that he wanted is to think about what it is that we have now , because if we do not realise what we have in the current moment, we may very well lose something extremely pure and vibrant. And just the loss ,the loss , or at least the change, of this one interview is enough to make an impact on the overall feel of the DVD. However, the triple pack is well worth it, if only to get the brilliant film, and to confirm that nothing holds a candle to the original THE CROW, and the sequels should never have been made... Lee's legacy should have been left as it was. Lee is truly masterful in this film. Milking the franchise destroys Brandons Legacy 
I splurged and treated myself to this set on my last birthday (Devil's Night.) I wanted to have all three films available should I feel the need to watch them again. The concept of supernatural justice has always appealed to me- it seems to be the only kind that really exists.... I wasn't dissappointed in this set. It contains all three of the "collectors series" versions, which means that they are packed full of special features. The profile of James O' Barr the creator of the original comic series was especially good. Plus, there is a special little booklet that gives an outline of the making of the films. I really can't quite get the resentment of some people over the last two films. I mean, the original comics were about the reoccuring theme of different Crows and different injustices to be righted. Sure, the original film is by far the best, almost supernaturally superior, but the other two also manged to stay true to the vision. 
The Crow- the first and obviously the best edition of The Crow series.Like many people say there was no other person destinied to play the role of Eric Draven better than Brandon Lee.Great action,excitement,and sadness any dark movie could ask for.With alot of great flash back scences to show the many faces of Draven.I give it 5/5 stars. The Crow:City of angels- It always makes me mad about hearing everyone dislike this movie because it didnt live up to the hype of the original crow.Its got a whole different plot to it.Im glad they didnt have each movie based around the same plot,that would pretty much make anyothers after the original seem rather one dimensional.I thought it had a lot of good things in it,show that there's different types of love and not just for the whole bf/gf. I give it 4/5 stars. The Crow:Salvation- in my opinion a really good movie in its own right.I mean it had alot of different things that the others were lacking,like mystery,we didnt know til near the very end of the movie,exactly who was behide the murders.With great acting by Jodi Lyne O'Keefe among others like Kirsten Dunst and Eric Mabius.The poor man being framed for the murder of his own girlfriend,his own death wasnt in vain because he came back from the dead to find the real criminals.I give it 4.5/5 stars. Like I said each movie had things about them that made them different and very well producted in their own rights.I'd say to any movie buff,these 3 you'd get your money's worth. 4.8/5 stars for the box se 
We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke... Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry. 
I found this film very entertaining! I loved the subtle pokes at suburbia and all the headaches that comes with it. Adults will enjoy the story as well as younsters. It's always fun to hear some of your favorite actors' voices in animated character form. But besides the fun, I feel this film had some good underlying lessons too. When we 'overindulge', we often cause ourselves trouble. One overindulgent racoon gets himself, and his friends, into a pickle by being greedy and self-serving. Will they be able to fix his mess, and more important, will they forgive him? Chrissy K. McVay - Autho 
The story drags a bit in the beginning, but by the end, my wife and I ended up enjoying the movie quite a bit. The voice acting was great all around (especially Shatner as a possum prone to playing possum) and the CGI animation is fine. Much of the movie seemed very familar - especially the set piece at the end which was lifted directly from the $300 episode of Futurama - but like they say, if you're going to steal, steal from the best. Ben Folds music is another highpoint (stick around for his kid friendly rendition of Rockin' the Suburbs). The extras are pretty good with highlights being extensive footage of the actors performing their lines, an additional cartoon featuring the original cast, and a sneak preview of Jerry Seinfeld's Bee Movie. All in all, I recommend this to fans of animation 
Considering I just saw Cars, I wasn't so sure about Over the Hedge. I mean, Cars actually became one of my favorites after I finished it! But I gave this a shot and I'm glad I did. I'll admit, the whole concept of R.J. using the others to repay a debt wasn't very original, but the way it was executed made it very enjoyable. Now I'm debating whether or not I want to buy it. I'd say rent it first, but if you have kids, this is a good one for your collection 
This is done by my friend. Over the Hedge is a very cute movie and one that the hole family can watch. It will have you laughing the hole time. It is hilarious and the animation is excellant and you'll be wanting to watch it again. I would deffanitly buy it! It was awesome 
Yeah yeah yeah, it was intended to kids...but the movie is so well made that grown-ups like yours truly will thoroughly enjoy it. The movie has thought provoking satire of modern lifestyle (SUVs, pizza delivery, urban sprawl, strip malls, and the like)that grown ups can immediately relate to. A bonus feature on the DVD shows what technology and blend of art, physics, computing and psychology a film of this caliber takes. If you are outside the intended age group for this movie (read: kids) and have no kids, I just gave you a perfect excuse to justify this DVD! Overall, highly recommended. 
For what you get in this DVD, the Amazon price ( current at the time of my writing) is fabulous value. The story runs the full range of emotions, and will touch the heart of kids, and Adults with good hearts, with the fun, joy and total adventure ride that the film encompasses. I am sure that everyone will support different characters, and Hammy with his Caffeine power is just a wow of a performance. They certainly did right by the consumer on this product 
R.J. The Raccoon (Bruce Willis) was just looking for something to eat as he stumbles into his bear friend's (Nick Nolte) cave and accidently destroys his food, he has an entire week to find almost every scrap of food for him or else he dies. He finds a family of animals (Gary Shandling, William Shatner, Wanda Sykes, Steve Carrell, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Avril Lavigne) and uses them for his scheme to go over the large hedge near their territory to the suburbs where they steal food from the humans. Later on, the home-owner Gladys (Allison Janey) hires professional exterminator Dwayne (Thomas Hayden Church) to kill them but can RJ save his own life or his new friends's? Extremely entertaining and fantastic CGI animated comedy from the makers of "Shrek 1 2", "Antz" and "Madagscar" Dreamworks provides great realistic CGI and laughs for everybody. There's also heart in this movie and shows the meaning of what it is like to have friends and be one's true self instead of being selfish! Steve Carrell's character Hammy the Squirrel steals the show here as the best character in the movie, it's a wonderful and hilarious movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. This DVD has some good extras like two sneek previews to "Shrek 3" and "Bee-Movie", audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurette, VerneTech commercial, games, meet the cast featurette and gallery. Highly recommended! the best Dreamworks animated movie since "Shrek 1 2" 
I have loved the comic series and I definitely loved the movie, RJ, Vern and Hammy especially will forever be my favorite urban forest critters. The forest critters meets suburbia is so smart, and as funy as the comic it was based on. 
This is the best of the animated films that flooded the box office this summer. Great voice talent, great storyline, and a highly enjoyable time at the movies. The story pokes fun at our society and our excesses when a family of animals invade suburbia. Dreamworks is giving Pixar a run for their money. 
it was a great exercise video, but my daughter and i had a little bit of a hard time keeping up with some of the moves, but overall it was a great workou 
After about 10 weeks of intensive dance lessons or a season of cheer practice your child should be easily able to perform the first five minutes of the "warm up". Otherwise, they will be very frustrated. It is very fast, very complicated. Well Choregraphed but even the "break it down" segment moves at double speed. 
Great video - easy to follow. Dances are clean and fun to do 
My 11 year old daughter found this too hard to keep up with. I think it is best for those with a dance background. The music is good, though 
I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchase this DVD. It is obvious that a profession choreographer was not involved in the making of this product at all. You are shown too many moves at once and they are shown to you very quickly. Even the "break down" section of the DVD is impossible to follow. VERY Disappointing 
Fun to watch but my 9 1/2 yr. old daughter could not follow the moves. Neither could I for that matter. We tried to learn the moves through "breaking it down" but there is just not enough repetition. Too complicated. 
This is the first of two Hardy Boys serials that originally appeared in "The Mickey Mouse Club". You will not get "The Mickey Mouse Club" on this DVD, just The Hardy Boys segments. In the mid 1990's the Disney Channel (cable tv) removed some of the MMC serials from the shows and created new half-hour shows of just those stories. New opening closing titles were created for these new mini-series. The then-famous song "Gold Doubloons Pieces of Eight" introduces you to "The Mystery Of Applegate's Treasure". A serialized story loosely based on the first Hardy Boys book "The Tower Treasure". Starring: Tim Considine (of Spin Marty fame) as Frank Hardy. Tommy Kirk (Old Yeller The Shaggy Dog) as Joe Hardy. Purists will be disappointed that they are not getting the complete, unedited, hour-long "Mickey Mouse Club" shows that these ran in, but fans will still enjoy these re-edited episodes 
I saw this cinematic masterpiece with my French class, and we were amazed and utterly captivated by the lush story of French teenaged despair. We felt close to Vic, as we could identify with her trauma and her crush on Mattieu. Vic's parents seemed similar to my French class' parents, and so did Vic's school, with its social hierarchy and innocent parties. I feel that "La Boum" truly makes a substantial effort to bridge the cultural gap in between American teenagers and their French peers. This effort is successful in my opinion, as our class found that we were laughing with Vic, crying with her, and screaming with her at her frustrating parents. We lived through "La Boum" in the shoes of a completely foreign and strange girl, and found that we weren't that much different, after all. "La Boum" made an impact on us more than "Goodburger" or "Totoro" ever could. 
For those who grew up watching the "American Pie" movies, the "La Boum" films must seem silly, harmless and bland. If you expect to see a lot of nudity and hear a lot of raunchy jokes, don't bother with this movie. If you want some harmless family fun and some conversational French practice - rent or buy "La Boum" 
I watched both parts of "La Boum" for the first time when I was about 12 years old. You can imagine how surprised I was when I found this movie on this website. This movie will definitely be appreciated by those who like French language, French cinematography and Sophie Morceau. It's a great listening practice. I don't want to go into details: if you want to know what it's about - watch it. It was made in 80s, and it makes it even more interesting 
It is nice to see Sarah Michelle Geller in a not-so-nice, anti-heroine role here. I'm so used to seeing her as "Buffy" 
Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics, who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989's Dangerous Liaisons (both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos's novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses). Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls. Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers. They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome. The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film). However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard. The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack, which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim. The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion. These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers. In the end though, perhaps we just like to see someone be very, very wicked and almost get away with it 
This movie was so amazing and I was extremely attracted to the theme. The story involves alot of seduction and betrayal. I call that the perfect mix for a teen movie. I am a teenager myself, and I found it to be quite interesting. The cast was great, and I think that made the movie even better. It was a movie involvong every type of character, the good girl, the evil whore, and to top it off, one guy for both girls. I would reccomend seeing it, but watch out because the content is a little intense sometimes. I hope you see it and enjoy 
This modern day addaptation of Dangerous Liasons took us to another level with the heartless, calculated antics of teenagers. While this was panned by critics, it spoke to something in the audience in it's sociopathic tendencies. Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn, the student body president of an elitist New York boarding school and step sister of Ryan Phillipe, the big man on campus whose charms hide a sinister skirt chaser. She makes a bet with him that he will not be able to bed Reese Witherspoon, who has proclaimed her intensions to remain a virgin until marriage. Should he succeed, he can have Kathryn. If he fails, Kathryn can have his car. Perhaps critics were astounded that kids can really be this cruel, but maybe they forgot what it was like to be a kid themselves. Just listen to the gossip and heartless talk of teenagers and you will know what I mean. Ryan Phillipe is every girl's dream come true and worst nightmare. While he uses his good looks and charms to get as many women in his bed as he can, he will post nude photos of them on the Internet and pat himself on the back as a stud. Give him a challenge, such as Reese Witherspoon, and he has to work hard for it. While he is truly a cad, he does in the end feel love for Reese because he had to work for her affections. Kathryn gets the greatest satisfaction of saying no, as she knows that he is truly hurt to have ended the affair when they did nothing but take joy in toying with emotions. Listen to a few locker room conversations and chats in the homeroom, that's what it's all about. As the viewer, you can't help but take perverse pleasure in their plotting and watching others fall victim to their schemes. How about that scene when Kathryn says she puts her trust in Jesus and unscrews the cross to reveil her coke spoon? That's classic. If anything it teaches you to not fall for others' fronts. So girls, be careful of who seems so sincere. And boys, don't be so cruel 
What more can you want?You have 5 of the hottest Hollywood stars and you get a sexy and also funny film.Get yor hands on this movie and the cruel Sarah Michelle Geller is facinating to watch.Also the end is such a tearjerker 
In the late 1990's something happened. Two movies came out. Neither was particularly well reviewed (although a few respected critics did give them good reviews) but despite all the negativity the two films became cult hits and are still referenced to today in movies all the time. These two movies were "Wild Things" and "Cruel Intentions". While "Wild Things" featured an elaborate plot, all-star cast, great sex scenes; "Cruel Intentions" plot is simple, has a cast of then up-and-comers, and has no nudity at all. Both of these movies scored with the MTV crowd and while you can find both films in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart, everyone remembers them. Also, both of these movies are just mindless fun; You're attention span doesn't have to be large and the people involved in both movies weren't trying to make classic films that would win Oscars and great acclaim, which in the long run attracted many critics and audiences to these movies. While I think Wild Things is a better movie, this film did keep me entertained for 94 minutes. Anyway, Ryan Phillippe plays Sebastian Valmont. Sebastian is a spoiled rich kid, who happens to be incredibly charming and takes pleasure in having sex with young women and destroying their lives. Everyone knows what Sebastian is like, and he loves it. His step-sister Kathryn is pretty much the same, except she basks in the role of the "good-girl", she's even student body president of the school they attend. One day, Kathryn tells Sebastian how a guy named Court has dumped her and fallen for a young idiot girl named Cecile (Selma Blair) and she wants Sebastian's help to destroy the young girl's life. Sebastian has found something a bit more interesting...The new headmaster's daughter Annette (Reese Witherspoon). Annette is a virgin, who plans to stay that way and Sebastian sees a challenge. So, Kathryn proposes a wager. If Sebastian succeeds in deflowering Annette, he will get the thing he's been longing for, for years. He'll get to bed Kathryn. If he loses, Kathryn gets his most prized possession...His car. Pit of a perverted plot yes and it comes together in funny, sometimes even stupid ways. But, as I said earlier for mindless entertainment it's dead on. As for the performances, Gellar is great as the sadistic little nice girl. With Phillippe, however, I couldn't tell if his acting was bad or if that's how Sebastian would act. Blair captures the innocent, unwitting virgin girl quality perfectly. She's so good in fact, she almost seems to be a virgin. Witherspoon (obviously, since she's the only person in this film to go and win anything) in really the strongpoint of the film. At this point in her career she really had the cute innocent girl face and qualities, and there's a few scenes in the movie where the "face" thing I mentioned is clearly there; but she's playing a different virgin girl from Blair. Witherspoon is playing the knowing, smart, want to wait for love girl. So, this movie is really not for everybody as you may have figured out by now. But if you're at the video store and just need 90 minutes of entertainment and fun, go for it. GRADE: B 
I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart. But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin 
I'm glad this is finally available on DVD - I've just about worn out my old VHS version of it. On this DVD you get an introduction by Kathy, followed by a warm-up routine. This is composed of some light aerobics and stretching. Then you get five different ab workouts, one for each day of the week. They each last about 10 - 12 minutes (I never actually timed them, but it seems like they get progressively longer from the first to the last). Each workout consists of approximately five different exercises, though there may be two or three variations on an exercise, so there's quite a bit of variety. Areas targeted are upper and lower abs and obliques (the muscles along the sides of the abs). The Monday workout is fairly easy and shouldn't present a problem for any but the most out-of-shape individuals. Tuesday's workout is only slightly harder. By the time you get to Wednesday and Thursday, they start getting rather challenging. To get through these you'll need to be in fairly descent shape. Friday is the really difficult one, I'd say a person would have to be in excellent shape to complete it. Of course, you can just stop and take a short rest if the exercises get to hard for you, then join back in. It took me about six weeks before I was able to complete the Friday workout all the way through without taking a few little breaks. I like to use this video as a warm-up before my weight lifting workout. Kathy does the workout along with 5 other people. The music is unobtrusive synth-pop type stuff with a little funk edge to it. You'll need a bench (or chair) and some dumbells (only used on two exercises, you could use some other object if you don't have dumbells). I'd recommend this tape for the moderately fit individual looking to get into even better shape. You'll definitely get a six-pack from doing these workouts, provided that your body fat percentage is low enough that you can see your abs 
This movie is hilarious, and it also delivers powerful truths about the workplace. My favorite scene is Doralee's--Dolly Parton's character's--fantasy about killing the rotten boss. This is Dolly's first movie, and she is a natural. Everyone in this film does a superb job. Made in 1980, but timeless 
Jane Fonda is best taken on screen in small doses, and the presence of the ace funny girl Lily Tomlin and the sexpot-on-the-outside, good-girl inside Dolly Parton in supporting roles help this project immensely. My favorite actor in this one, however, is Dabney Coleman as the evil boss. There are a few excesses, including a marijuana scene which rings false for this trio of co-workers, but the overall experience is just good fun for a couple of hours. 
Lilly Tomlin is hysterical in this movie. She makes this movie. It' fun, and your rooting for the women all the way. One specific part is not for the kids. My kids were bored with it. But I enjoyed it from the release date and it's still entertaining 
I love 9 to 5. It is truly a classic. The pairing of Jane Fonda, Lilly Tomlin, and Dolly Parton is genius. This movie keeps me laughing the whole time 
Brilliant.Although the film has aged,it's still just as funny all these years later.This is a must for anyone who has ever had thoughts of getting revenge on a boss.The documentary afterwards is great as it offers a lookat how the three girls ended up filming it together.10/10 even after 25 years 
A great movie! Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda are wonderful! I'm so glad this movie is in my DVD library! The laughter will be side splitting! They really give Dabney Coleman a run for his money! A must have DVD for any collection 
FIRST THOUGHTS - - This movie is among the greatest 100 minute entertainment fests in existence. "9 to 5" reaches and touches everybody, both male and female somewhere personal and strangely satisfying. Though the plot is great and really moves, it is the smart "fantasy-revenge" ideas, dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming mean-spirited and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience. We need to salute Director/Screenwriter, Colin Higgins first. Higgins was the Screenwriter for "Harold and Maude", "Silver Streak" and "Foul Play", picking up a Golden Globe nomination for "Foul Play" in 1978. All of Higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious mean-spirited cliches that many of his films' topics' encompass. Also, Editor Pembroke J. Herring who was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Editing and also edited "Ground Hogs Day", did an amazingly seamless job of keeping "9 to 5" so coherently glued together. Herring was nominated for "Best Editing" for; "Tora! Tora!Tora!", 1970, "Bound For Glory",1976, "Out Of Africa", 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas. Higgins and Herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and "9 to 5" is one of them. The three female leads all embody some type of stereotype. Lily Tomlin, as Violet Newstead is the widow with four children, going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years - UNSUCCESSFULLY. She is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man's world, so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through F. Hart [Dabney Coleman]. Jane Fonda, as Judy Bernly, is in the middle of a divorce in which her no-good husband, Dick, played deftly by Lawrence Pressman, left her for his secretary. Judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself, F.Hart. Dolly Parton as the delightful Doralee Rhodes, who F.hart chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time - HIS, examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself. That's F.Hart of course and he is the bane of these three "innocent women" and as we see, represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it. BTW, Dolly Parton in this role was nominated for an "Oscar", "Best Song", and 3 "Golden Globes", includeing "Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy". This film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training. Dabney Coleman as Franklin Hart or just F.HART, delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office. He is "his" 3 "GIRLS" reason for being the way they are, at least throughout the film. Coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role Carrol O'Connor did in "All In The Family" as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed. Comedy and Cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and "9 to 5" serves that cause well, chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of Coleman's character. Man or woman, we all enjoy Coleman's comeupance and so will you. My favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana. Naturally, these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against F.Hart. Even such animated Disney characters as "Snow White" make an appearance in Tomlin's depiction of Hart's demise. Naturally, the reality nearly repeats Tomlin's fantasy on the very next day, which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse, evading the police, kidnapping and much, much more. The scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just dove-tail so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon. We are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film's plot have been resolved. This is a terrific black comedy. Our characters [3 female leads] gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction. Their foil, F.HART after showing all how despicable he was, literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds. "REEL JUSTICE", tidy and quick!! The topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated. --* THE CAST --* Colin Higgins - Director / Screenwriter Jane Fonda - Judy Bernly Lily Tomlin - Violet Newstead Dolly Parton - Doralee Rhodes Dabney Coleman - Franklin Hart Jr. Sterling Hayden - Tinsworthy Elizabeth Wilson - Roz Henry Jones - Hinkle Lawrence Pressman - Dick Marian Mercer - Missy Hart --* THE AWARDS --* Best Song (nom) Dolly Parton 1980 Academy Best Actress- Musical or Comedy (nom) Dolly Parton 1980 Golden Globe Best Original Song (nom) Dolly Parton 1980 Golden Globe New Star of the Year - Female (nom) Dolly Parton 1980 Golden Globe DVD FEATURES: It is widescreen [1.85:1] and much clearer than the VHS release. The Disney characters in Violet's fantasy demonstrate this obvious color and clarity improvement over the video release. It has 1 trailer and of course scene selection and is available on the same DVD in either English or French with English or Spanish subtitles or no subtitles at all [of course]. Naturally, some interviews and a neat featurette would be nice but again this is a large improvement over the old faded video releases. FINAL THOUGHTS - - This wonderful film is highly recommended and "9 to 5s" entertainment value stands up very well to repeated viewings and the passage of 26 years. 
This review is for the 2001 DVD release. Have you ever daydreamed about what you would like to do to your boss who was too hard on you or did something to you objectionable? Well, these secretaries did. They carried out a plan against their boss and got away with it. Please keep in mind, this film is a comedy and was made to laugh at. However, their are some strong messages here that can be well learned. Bosses should not verbally abuse and/or sexually intent, touch, harass any employee. This film does point out employees have rights too. Managers can be in the wrong too. Jane Fonda is "Judy Bernly". Recently divorced. Has no experience, but is a very decent woman. Today is her first day at Consolidated Companies LTD. On her first day everything goes wrong. Lily Tomlin is "Violet Newstead". She has worked their forever. Never spies. She is ready for a promotion. She trains Judy on her first day. In fact, Violet has trained most of the people there and they have been promoted instead of her. Dolly Parton (in her first film) is "Doralee Rhodes". Mr. Hart's main secretary. There is bad gossip going around about the boss and the secretary, but it is not true. Doralee is a married woman and is a Christian and pure as Judy is and would never engage in bad behavior at work. Dabney Coleman is the boss, "Franklin Hart". He is the boss and the vice-president. Has has a bad mouth towards secretaries and wants "personal servitude" that is not part of the job description. After the boss makes personal advances towards Doralee, makes inappropriate comments towards Violet and dismisses Maria (Roxanna Bonilla-Giannini) for having light conversation in the bathroom and guessing the bosses salary, and after another incident, Violet, along with Doralee and Judy later decide that something has to be done to the boss and improvements must be made within the company. Better working conditions for all. Violet just might get her promotion yet. Also in the cast: Elizabeth Wilson, Peggy Pope, Sterling Hayden, Lawrence Pressman, Marian Mercer. Yes, that is Dolly Parton singing "Nine To Five". Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman also worked together in On Golden Pond (1981). Followed by the tv series Nine To Five (1982-83) with Rita Moreno as "Violet", Valerie Curtin as "Judy", and Rachel Dennison as "Doralee". Jane Fonda was one of the Producers and Executive Producers. Rachel Dennison is Dolly Parton's real-life sister. Update: As of April 2006, the cast reunited to celebrate the 2006 DVD release. According to Jane Fonda on "Larry King Live", they are in "talks" of a sequel 
9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling. It takes a look at the workplace from a woman's view. We first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them. She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it. Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office. She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living. Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is "banging the boss". But the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train. She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he's been having an affair with Doralee. And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond. Each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss. Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey. Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit. But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart. The next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee. When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him. This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse. The next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up. The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart. Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence. The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence. Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart's absence. Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else's glory. The subject matter here is very serious. So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly. This is a film that many people identify with. Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them. And this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors. You will laugh until it hurts. DVD EXTRAS: Commentary by producer Bruce Gilbert and stars Lily, Jane and Dolly 9 to 5 @ 25 - a 25 minute featurette with interviews with Gilbert, writer director Colin Higgins and stars Lily. Jane, Dolly and Dabney Coleman. Deleted Scenes - 10 mostly expanded scenes or alternate takes. The problem is without some kind of commentary we do not know why the scene was cut. 
However, did anyone else notice how 25 years later, Dabney Coleman is referring to Tomlin, Fonda and Parton as "gals" and "girls" in the 9 to 5 at 25 featurette? Made me wonder.... 
This movie may be unfamiliar to American viewers, who watch american movies only. But this is a very humorous movie, starring some of Russia's best comedians - Yuri Nikulin and Andrei Mironov. In Bulgaria, they used to show it on every New Year's day. The plot is like this: A russian turist (Nikulin) in Istanbul slips and falls and says "Chort Poberi" (which means something like "damn", or "hell", or "go to the devil" in russian language.) This happens to be a password for some bandits, who await their man (Mironov) to smuggle diamonds in the cast of his would-be broken arm. Without realizing what is happening, Nikulin's character smuggles the diamonds. Then he has encounters both with the russian police and with the bandits. And there is a happy end... Watch this film, I'm sure you will enjoy it. In Bulgaria, you can legally buy it on a DVD for just $2 
An hilarious movie about mistaken identity, the Russian mafia, the KGB and an unsuspecting nice guy in the middle of it all! Nikulin is hilarious as usual, and what can you say about the peerless Mironov? I watched this movie back in St.P some 14 years ago, and even when my Russian was just in the basic stage I could still follow it. Once my Russian progressed, I grasped all the very funny word play and situational humour. If you like enjoying yourself - buy this movie 
I have read one negative review about this film and I would like to clarify the statements made in it. I am Russian so, obviously, I like this film. It has typical Russian humor, it is a farce, so do not look for higher meanings in the jokes, it makes fun of the social standards of the Soviet regime as well as the people who served it so well. It features some of the best Russian actors that we love seeing and acting; they sing in the movie and it is lovely as well. If you are a tough judge of movies, then please make sure you know Soviet history a bit and understand that the humor differs from what you see in American movies before you call it crap. I do not see why there should be a problem with characters not talking for the first ten minutes of the movie. In fact, it is just a few minutes during which you are shown the premise of the movie. And as for cyrillic letters not making sense: this is a Russian movie and you are bound to see everything written in our gibberish alphabet. Besides, the movie begins with a cruise in a foreign country (it was shot in Baku, Azerbajan but is supposed to be Turkey). The language spoken by the locals as well as the signs on buildings are gibberish - it was made up specially for the movie. That said, I want to say a few words about the plot. Semen Semenovich is a diligent Russian economist goes on a cruise, where he gets acquainted with a mafia mob's right hand, Kozodoev, whose assignment is to pick up diamonds from the supplier and deliver it back to Moscow via a cast on his arm. During one of the last stops, Semen Semenovich gets mistaken for Kozodoev and ends up with a cast and jewels inside it. As he returns to Moscow, Semen contacts the police. Now, he has to pose as bait and escape the traps elaborately planted by the mafia. As I already said, the movie is fantastic. Just remember that it is a farce. And no, there is not slapstick humour. Be open-minded and enjoy! Oh, and by the way, all the jewelry you will see on the screen is authentic. It's mentioned in the beginning that the film crew would like to thank all Soviet individuals who lend their gems for the filming. 
This movie is the greatest classic comedy ever. Don't listen to the lady, who gave this movie only 2 stars, she doesn't know what she is talking about. Only person with the limited sence of humor may not like this film. Believe me it's wonderfull.!!!! 
Every review I've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just don't get it. No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it, and by then you're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters, it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next. If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal. Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases. I have to wonder what they could be: "Damned Melon!" or "I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!"??? I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether. In sum, don't waste your time 
This movie is one of those films that never grow old. It's been the total hit for more than 30 years. Sparkling humour won't let you be bored. The acting is great! Phrases from the movie are now popular aphorisms! The movie arises in you the warmest feelings! Enjoy this movie 
This is a typical (semi slapstick) Gaiday film. It is corny, well produced, and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy. The subtitles are just fine. You do not have to understand any Russian to laugh at this movie. Buy it, and enjoy 
This film was dope, a must see for anyone who is curious about Hip-Hop culture, or for those that need to know the History. A very informative documentary, an essential in any hip-hop collection 
WOW! This brought back so many memories for me. I was shocked when a friend of mine gave me this DVD as a Christmas present because I'm the ultimate Old-School head. And to my surprise (and his) I'm in it! As the DVD plays, there are seemingly a hundred still shots of "jams" and "crew pictures" being faded in and out that give you a glimpse of our attitudes and fashions of the time. If you were there, you may spot some of your peeps. This is one of the most accurate DVDs chronicling the birth of Hip-hop, when it wasn't about the money bling. The "artists" interviewed are telling the real story. A must have for all the aspiring DJ's, MC's, and dancers of today 
It amazes me how something like B-boyin' that is so inventive, exhilerating, and positive could have only been in the mainstream media for less than 2 years (circa 1983-1985) but a fad like being a gangster (that is so negative), has been in the mainstream media for nearly 15 years! (NWA introduced it in the late 80's. It's sad to see that Hip Hop has turned into the very thing that it swore to diminish. 
I wanted to do a grad school paper on something I was interested in researching and I picked Hip-Hop. After working for an underground Hip-Hop magazine, I'd already familiarized myself with a lot of information that I was too young to understand (being born in '81). I visited the University of Hip-Hop in Chicago, interviewed underground artists, and went to breaking shows in the Illinois area. Although I thought I was very familiar with Hip-Hop, after working with this magazine, I realized I knew NOTHING. So when I was given the chance to do my research paper, I knew that I would be able to learn even more than I already knew from working for the magazine. I watched the three parts of "Beef" first and saw an ad for this movie in the Extras section. Honestly, the first thing that caught my eye was how gorgeous Mr. Wiggles was...but then after fully watching the preview, I realized this was the PERFECT movie for me to find out more about breaking. This movie documented the founding members, discussed the four elements of Hip-Hop, gave a lot of background information on Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash, talked about the different techniques in breaking, the label "breakdancing," the media's dilution of breaking, the first movies that breaking was showcased in, new breaking groups...just a bunch of "firsts." It was a great reference for my paper, I enjoyed watching it, and I could watch it over and over again. I have a lot of respect for the founders because without them, headz wouldn't have this beautiful culture to express ourselves physically, mentally, and verbally 
Covering all aspects of b-boy culture, this great documentary is a must have for all those who always loved b-boying. You may drop a tear or two at the end of it. Just for serious hip-hop cats. Just explendid 
This has to be the freshest b-boy documentary I've ever seen!!!! From the early days in N.Y. with Kool Herc and the Rock Steady Crew, you are treated to the best footage and interviews on this planet!! Everything is covered here you won't be dissapointed. Much love to all B-boys and B-girls in the universe. Much respect to Crazy Legs and company for a job well done. If you love breaking you can't miss this one!! DJ Grass Miami, Fl 
I am a 'professional' female in my 30's, and remember and love breakdancing. I am soooo glad I bought this DVD which I plan on giving to my son for his birthday. But now the DVD will be OURS! What's great about it is that it shows the old 70's/early 80's b-boying stars clips and then talks to the same people all grown up in their 30's/40's today. You WILL watch this over and over! Great history and roots of this NYC, then West Coast phenomenon...If only today's Hip Hop Rap were as fun and clean as breakdancing was.. 
This DVD totally covers pretty much everything you should know about the B-boy and B-boy culture. As far as how it started, to where it stands today. The interviews are raw, and to the point. From the footage of the early days, to the present, is very well put together. It just, all flows. Very fresh. Also the special features isn't just a bunch of crap, which usually gets put on DVD's. This DVD is way worth the price, and well wicked. Buy It! peace 
This video is definitely a worth wild DVD. From the original footage to today - it was all great. I watched it three times over the weekend and still saw new moves that Ive never saw before. its a great investment. Crazy Legs is the man 
Ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house. 8 women, every one of them with their affective lacks, their tribulations. Little miseries, sorrows and disillusions. Each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered Marcel. The admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage, with a sublime red carpet that remind us Bergman in Cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo) expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film, plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses. A must-see! 
Seemingly a French take-off on the classic English Mystery Play format this delightful farce is actually a perfect proof of how great and sexy, women of all ages are (especially French women). Starring: Catherine Deneuve, Virginie Ledoyen, Ludivine Sagnier, Isabelle Huppert, Danielle Darrieux, Fanny Ardant, Firmine Richard, Emmanuelle Bï¿½art 
A previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values, however, even though there are elements of the risque in the film, the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all. I thought that the plot, the scenery, the songs and everything else was all great. It is a French musical whodunnit but one that doesn't take itsself too seriously. Whoever wrote the bad review shouldn't take it so seriously either (besides, it's ridiculous to rip on a countries birthrate as if it is part of the artistic value of a movie, so he should have ranted somewhere a bit more appropriate.) My favorite characters were played by Denouve and Huppert (both of whom are amazing actresses in their own rights) and all of the twists and turns kept me entertained, even though a bit of suspension of disbelief is required. Then again, it is a musical, so disbelief should be left at the door 
Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid 
The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness. Nor even, for that matter, for titillation. When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why. Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played. "Eight Women" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies. Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange. By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience. 
Having stumbled onto this film being played on TV late last night and given that Emmanuelle Bart was in this, I was immediately hooked into watching it. As has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinma francais. Deneuve, Bart, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert......the list goes on. And being that the story revolves around these 8 women ( yes I know but there was really no other way of putting it ), it keeps you locked in. What I found fascinating were the songs. Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes! The basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry. It's that good! Just simply superb. There's nothing else to add 
This farcical "who done it" is funny, absurd, campish, and silly all at the same time. Starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the French cinema, 8 femmes reminds me of similar tongue-in-cheek "who done its" such as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and especially Neil Simon's Murder by Death. Adapted from the play by Robert Thomas, which accounts for the stage play feel to the production, this one begins--as a proper murder mystery might--with a murder in a well-appointed house out in the country. Somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion. While Neil Simon made fun of detectives in Murder by Death, and Agatha Christie made fun of murder, period, here the fun is on the players themselves. What follows, as all point fingers away from themselves, is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about. The scandalous revelations, including interracial lesbianism, same- and heterosexual incest, etc., are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties. (Note Suzon's pink/orange pony skirt.) To quote a line from the film, "it's a sad family affair" played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight. Yet, there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film. Strange. In another sense this is a celebration of some of the French cinema's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs. Catherine Deneuve heads the cast as Gaby the wife of the murdered. She looks stately, beautiful and more than a bit spoiled. Danielle Darrieux at 85 steals a few scenes as the mother, Mamy. Isabelle Huppert makes herself into a neurotic, dotty old maid named Augustine while Emmanuelle Beart plays Louise, the sexy maid. Fanny Ardant is Pierrette, Gaby's scandalous sister-in-law. The cast takes turns doing lightweight song and dance numbers which tends to fluff out the production in a sweet fifties-ish way. In a kind of gender joke, no men appear in the movie, although we do see the back of Marcel (Gaby's husband) a couple of times. You will not be able to guess who done it, but I will not tell you why. See this for Danielle Darrieux, one the grande dames of the French cinema whose film credits go back to 1931--yes, 1931. She has a lot of fun in a juicy part 
Yes, this murder mystery is twisted and dark, but also wonderful to watch. All the characters (with the possible exception of the father) are so intriguing and bizarre...and they tend to break out into song at the drop of a hat. What a nasty family, but one can't help being sucked into their vicious yet humorous little spats and heated debates. They put the fun in the word dysfunctional, without a doubt. Beyond the wonderful characters is the beautiful scenery. True that it is primarily shot indoors, but the colors are stunningly vivid and bright. Maybe it is in contrast to the darkness of the plot, I don't know, but it is certainly a feast for the eyes. The story itself is pretty good, and not difficult to follow, but the interactions between these outstanding characters are absolutely priceless and make this movie one you should not miss. 
8 women is a good musical/ murder mystery with humor, light heartedness and mystery. It combines a bunch of the best French actrices, and an enjoyable plot. A real guesser until the end 
Wall Street, the movie starring Michael Douglas is lame compared with this docutainment. Whereas the first offering is fictitious, the latter is Enron, a global brand that's since become a verb and even becoming skits in the Simpsons! How would a company that started out humbly would grow so fast so big in a few years would then taking record breaking speed to go bankrupt and then ruining the livelihood of so many ordinary people and that it puts the Bush family in an awkward situation for being overfriendly with Ken Lay, the founder of Enron in the early days? This docutainment could have been a dry boring subject and yet, it's captivating to view. The authors believed that what made Enron so enticing to the public mass is its human tragedy aspect. Brilliant people who would be so blinded by their own arrogance, pride, narcissim, brilliance, greed that they would do something so stupid for digging a hole so big and so deep that they couldn't get themselves out of it. This docutainment is the story about Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, the fall guy, Falstow (the CFO) who would be left to hang to dry and their doings that would have such a detrimental impact on so many people. It's outrageous to hear the tape recording of Enron traders of bragging the money that they were making at expense of California power crisis. Somehow, human tragedy of such epic proportion shall repeat itself again someday because we humans don't seem to learn from mistakes. An intriguing documentary that needs to be seen to be believed 
This is an excellent portrayal of the Enron fiasco. It utilizes footage and sound bites, and interviews, it's absolutely amazing what happened! This film is a must see for everyone 
Because the Enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in American history, this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms. More importantly, this documentary shows how the American criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations. As a result of the aforementioned, I use this audio-visual as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike. 
The documentary Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room had a bit of a rough start. Although intriguing, it failed to deliver the rough sketch of the Enron scandal quick enough. I'll shamefully admit that I had forgotten most of the details of the Enron scandal, as I was in college when it broke and I didn't care too much about it at the time. But, once the overall story had been discussed, this documentary did a fairly good job of telling a compelling narrative and trying to explain the rather complicated financial wizardry that was ultimately the corporation's downfall. The depictions of Skilling were very clear and it was nice to see a woman was at the heart of breaking the story and writing the movie (which was based on a book she co-wrote). Amusing use of music and title-cards kept the pace quick, and unlike Michael Moore's documentaries, this one was actually full of well presented facts. I'd definitely recommend seeing this movie, especially because it reveals yet another reason to hate W and his administration. I wish more people were interested in this kind of reporting and that our day-to-day media was this intellectually engaging 
The news did not really give justice to what was really happening with Enron during that time. Why it fell. How some people wondered why they did not have data like a normal company. This movie is just wonderful. It shows how they made a total joke of the American Stock Market and got away with it. Power outages in California were actually intentional by Enron. The story goes on obviously after the movie has been filmed. With that misterious death of Ken Ley. Sucide also resulted as a consequence of this crash. Many people have no savings yet has anyone gone to jail over this yet? Watch how much fun they were having in the hay day of Enron. How they played hard and how a few people got really rich while others were devistated. This is an imporatant movie. Then you might want to review the more recent news on the company to see where we are at now. Where is Jeffrey Skilling now?? Last I knew he still was not in Jail. Who will be punished for this or is it okay because of our new corporate climate? Okay in the sense of the law of the USA that is. Martha Stewart went to jail and served time will anyone for this??? 
I am a CPA I watched the film in an ethics class we are required to take, essentially because of the fall of Enron. I have since bought the video watched it at least 5 other times. Of course there are political slants. For example, they try tie the Bush administration(s)(Sr. Jr.) to Enron. But, the majority of the film deals with what happened to Enron, so that in the end, the stock you purchased was worth $0. I would highly recommend any person interested in business or the fraud aspect in business to watch this documentary. A riveting documentary on the rise fall of Enron who the major players in Enron were. 
Kenneth Lay and his cohorts were looking to make millions not for the company but for themselves. They took advantage of the investors, the employees and the public. They knew what they were doing and were stopping at nothing to get what they wanted. The chips came crashing down when speculation from a Fortune magazine writer saw that the financial figures didn't add up. Skilling knew that the company was facing severe trouble if it were found that they were tampering with numbers and taking millions from the corporation. Enron fell hard like the World Trade Center when it was reported that its earnings were dropping like flies and bankruptcy was the ultimate demise. The documentary explores the dark side of humans. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were ruthless as well as greedy hoarding large sums of money for their personal use putting employees out of work and leaving them with no nest egg. They cashed out their stocks and rested on their earnings while their side employees have to suffer not only the financially but emotionally. This is a very good documentary to watch. No one should be scared not to invest in the stock market. But always be careful and alert as to how this company is operating 
At first, I wasn't too keen on seeing this movie- Its title, ENRON-THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM- suggested to me that it would be about a bunch of smart guys number crunching on their way to faking accounting records. What else would a bunch of 'smart guys' do? Well, certainly the Enron executives did this. The film explains in easy to understand terms how Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling demanded the use of 'Mark to Marketing' - an accounting scheme allowing him to post 'future profits' of an new idea immediately (ie, if an idea of inventing a new spaceship design is expected to reap a billion dollars in the future, one could post the profits now, never mind that the ship may never get built, if built may not work as envisioned, or people may loose interest in space, and so on.) Of course, such profits were not 'real' but nicely balanced off Enron's actual massive losses. Also balancing off Enron's massive losses were the fake companies created by Andy Fastow, which he used to bury Enron's enormous debts- and in the meantime, pocketed millions for himself. But while shady accounting schemes may explain the technical, proximate causes of the fall of Enron, it is not the ultimate explanation. The ultimate reason why Enron fell is pure, naked, ugly- and all to human- Greed. And this is what the film portrays, and does so brilliantly, with insider footage showing 'Enron skits' and meetings, and recordings of conversations and deals being made in the trading floor. We get to see Jeff Skilling in a skit in which he snickers and mocks his own accounting strategy, stating "...we can add a kazillion dollars to the bottom line." We see Andy Fastow in an insider video, with a sly grin on his face, explaining to greedy bankers (all the big guns like Citibank, Deutsche Bank, etc) his scheme to be the CFO of both his shell company LJM and Enron. Never mind any conflict of interest, as he will always be on 'LJM's side of the transaction" (netting both him and the greedy bankers money at the expense of Enron). Even worse was the greedy, cut throat culture that developed among Enron traders. My jaw dropped as I heard one trader coolly telling a California energy power station to 'power down' for a bit, by 'making up' an excuse, so they could artificially limit California's energy supply to make obscene profits. Even worse were traders laughing hysterically and cheering as energy power lines burned in California, chanting "Burn Baby Burn!!" And why not? Supposedly a young trader could make enough in one afternoon to buy a Mercedes Benz, flat out! Other facets of the ugly face of Enron included the bizarre 'extreme sport' trips taken by Enron Execs (bunch of guys riding motor cycles in the dirt) and the practice of taking clients out to strip clubs and charging it to the corporate account (exemplified by Lou Pai, but was popular among the rest as well- when this was eventually cancelled at the severe protest of some female employees, apparently a pall of silence fell over the trading floor for 3 days!). There is also Enron's arrogance that it could 'trade' everything, including the weather! Jeff Skilling comes off as particularly arrogant- he states he wanted to help FORTUNE reporter Bethany Mclean "understand what she is asking" when she wanted to know why Enron's numbers didn't add up. When despite his bullying, she decided to publish her findings (or lack of) anyway, he amazingly calls her decision 'unethical.' Well, clearly, Mclean did know what she was asking- "IS ENRON OVERPRICED" was the first article suggesting something maybe wrong with Enron. Later, he calls someone else who questioned the validity of Enron's accounting an "a-- h---." Compared to Skilling and the others, Ken Lay comes off as rather clueless, but just as greedy. It is almost as if he didn't really care what went on in his company, as long as it made money. We see him on 9-11-2001 comparing Enron's troubles to 9-11, but stating with confidence that things will bounce back. Later, when Enron is in a free fall, he makes bizarre claims to his worried employees that the company is strong, and will regain healthy stock figures, causing one of his employees to ask him "are you are on crack." Indeed. The film also highlights the fact that guilt for the Enron debacle falls far beyond Enron itself. Greedy corporate banks actively participated in illegal money-making deals with Fastow, as mentioned above. Accounting firm Arthur Anderson happily cooked Enron's books with Mark-to-Marketing accounting and other accounding frauds, and then shredded millions of documents when investigations began. Stock analysts happily took Jeff Skilling's word that Enron's stock was doing great- and issued 'strong buy' or 'buy' ratings, without actually analyzing the stock. Lawyers signed off on everything. And the rest of us, dazzled by the stock market boom and greedy at the thought of making big bucks, kept buying Enron stock. No one ever "asked why" Enron was such a shining star- and whether it really deserved to be. The insider material on Enron (the recordings, the videos) alone would have made a fascinating, shocking tale. But the movie adds incisive, fast paced interviews with both insiders and critics of Enron, as well as catchy, and very appropriate theme tunes. (`Dear Mr. Fantasy' for Andy Fastow is particularly appropriate- as it sounds like `Dear Mr. Fastow!') As Amazon suggests, watch this move with THE CORPORATION. THE CORPORATION provides the theoretical background as to the psychopathic nature of all corporations, while this movie provides the perfect, feature length case-study. 
****1/2 Don't be surprised if you find yourself throwing things at the screen while watching "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room," a brilliantly effective and meticulously researched documentary (based on the book by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind) that is guaranteed to get both your dander and your adrenaline up to dangerously high levels. Rarely does a real life event provide us with as clear and universally recognized a symbol of a larger social theme as does the fall of Enron, which, in the years since it happened, has come to stand for everything that's wrong with corporate America. It is the classic tale of corruption and unethical behavior performed in the service of unbridled greed. That the men responsible for the disaster took so many innocent people down with them is what makes it a tragedy. In fact, more than one person interviewed for the film draws the parallel between the downfall of Enron and the sinking of the Titanic - an apt analogy if ever there was one, only, in this case, the captains had no intention of going down with the ship, preferring instead to ruthlessly knock over any number of helpless women and children in the desperate race to the lifeboats. The beauty of the film is that it takes a very complex and convoluted story and makes it completely comprehensible to those of us who might otherwise get lost in the maze of arcane corporate-world details. The movie introduces us to the key players - primarily CEOs Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay, and CFO Andrew Fastow - showing the step-by-step process by which they built the energy corporation virtually from scratch, raised it to the position of seventh largest company in the world, then slowly destroyed it through deceit, hubris and greed - but not, of course, before bestowing obscene multi-million dollar packages on themselves as compensation. We see how they employed little more than smoke-and-mirror accounting schemes to pull the wool over the eyes of investors, regulatory commissions and fellow employees. However, the film makes it clear that a large number of "reputable" banks and loan agencies must also have been complicit in the company's malfeasance for all of this to have come off so effectively. As always, it is the "little guy" who winds up getting shafted. Probably the greatest hair-pulling section of the film involves Enron's cold-blooded creation and manipulation of California's bogus "energy crisis" in the early 2000's, which drained billions from the state`s treasury, a situation which the newly elected President Bush, ever sympathetic to his buddies in the energy business, refused to help rectify. Just as bad is the CEOs' callous encouragement of their own lower level employees to invest their retirement savings in the company's 401K plan that the chief executives themselves knew would soon be defunct. With hissable villains like these around, who needs fiction? The sole consolation is the fact that the system did work in the end, that the wrongdoers eventually overreached to such an extent that the house of cards they had built finally came tumbling down. There's certainly a great deal of joy in seeing the creeps responsible for the catastrophe being carted off to jail in handcuffs and sweating under the public scrutiny of a congressional investigative committee. (It should be noted that the film predates Ken Lay's death in 2006). The movie also balances the case by highlighting some of the "heroes" in the story, primarily whistleblowers within the company and a resourceful reporter for FORTUNE magazine who was the first to hint in a public forum that Enron might just be the corporate equivalent of the emperor with no clothes. This is more than just a mere "talking heads" documentary. It explores the details of the story within the broader context of unbridled capitalism, de-regulation, and corporate corruption. The movie also shows us how strangely immature the men at the head of this company were, with their frat boy antics and the daredevil activities they indulged in to erase their "nerd" image and to establish their bona fides as real "macho" men. The fact that individuals of this caliber could spell the ruin of so many trusting people is what gives the movie's title that little ironic kick. By all means, don't miss this film - though you might want to have a good stiff drink handy for when it's over 
This dvd I received was way better than chocolate. The dvd was quick in getting sent to me and I loved being able to track it and know exactly when it should be here by. The dvd was in wonderful condition. New in fact and wonderful 
Honestly, I wasn't certain about this film, in fact, at first I actually believed it was related to "Chocolate." I was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised. Upon first viewing, I did not laugh as much as the second time. Yes, I tend to watch a film twice for I know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories. I can be more relaxed and open minded the second time. Second viewing was a belly full of laughter. This is the best lesbian comedy I have ever seen. The acting was wonderful and the film was fast paced. Now that I decided that this film is exceptional, it was time to put it to the test on others (mostly women 20's - 80's years, some men.) Each person I shared this film with, either loaning it or viewing it together, all responded similarly: "This is a hysterically funny film." What is even more amazing is the brief allotted time the director accomplished in completing the filming process - about twenty-two days. Congratulations, sometimes a tight budget can produce a true work of art. Many short films I have seen on the "Spiritual Cinema Circle" also have numerous low budget wonderful productions. Hoorah for the film art genius. I applaud the entire talented cast and crew, especially actress, Christine Cox, her performance was exceptionally wonderful. I would like to see her in more comedies...she's a natural. I fell "in love with her" and I am straight gal, as are all of the actresses except for Frances. A must see funny film. I always wondered why the comedy male gay films always had that edge of humor when the lesbian films appeared more serious. We need more films that are as pleasurable and diversified as "Better Than Chocolate". Thanks bunches. 
Plot twists everywhere! A movie of many mini-dramas in one, but blended together so well it's an exhilirating rollercoaster of love, lust, and the bonds of family. We don't know anything about Maggie (Karyn Dwyer) before she comes to this "interesting part of town" other than she's left university to find herself, and BE herself. She gets a phone call from her mother, who doesn't know she's a lesbian, and the fun begins. Mother Lila, (Wendy Crewson) is divorcing her husband and with brother Paul (Kevin Mundy) in tow, needs a place to stay. Maggie finds a loft as a sublet, but there is a snag. After performing a lip synching at a club she's met the girl of her dreams. Kim (Christina Cox) is staying with Maggie as well, now to keep the affair from Lila! Kim is torn. She wants Maggie to come out to her mother so they don't have to hide their relationship. She wants Maggie to be able to openly declare her love for her, but Maggie is so afraid. The fear ultimatly threatens to tear the two women apart. We meet Maggie's friends, her boss Frances (Ann-Marie MacDonald), her friend, a transexual named Judy (Jerry Outerbridge), her co-worker Carla (Marya Delver), and coffee shop owner Tony (Tony Nappo). Frances is at war with Customs, as they continually threaten her livlihood by witholding shipments of books and videos for her store. Carla is a bi-sexual free spirit who "likes hard centers, soft centers, all the chocolates in the box". Judy, who is under the misundersanding that her father has forgiven her for becoming a transexual befriends Lila and starts bringing her around to Maggie's point of view. Inadvertantly, Maggie's friends begin introducing Lila and Paul to new and exciting experiences. Maggie's fears of coming out to her mother are soon alieviated when Lila discovers her in bed with Kim and the conflict grows. Amid gay bashing and hate crimes the outcome of the movie is perfectly tied up and delightful. Helped along with an astounding soundtrack this is one movie you simply MUST add to your collection 
Very simply... it was good. I thought it to be funny and real. I'd watch it again 
I really hope that no one was expecting an Oscar worthy performance. No it`s not the best movie ever as far as plot and acting but, I don`t remember seeing too many high dollar ads for it, do you? It was a DAMN good feel good movie though. This movie will help point out a few issues the GLBT community faces but barely scratches the surface. If it is erotic lesbians you seek, KEEP SEEKING. Even the uncut version is barely "R" worthy. So once again everyone, NOT a pent house flick, NOT a documentary AND in no way is it Oscar worthy, and with all that said, It was one of the best ROMANTIC COMEDIES I`ve seen in a long time. I highly recomend it to anyone just looking for a relaxing evening 
It's hard to mix a meaningful, important message with fun and laughs. Better Than Chocolate is the best example of that successful combination. An important plot full of emotion and difficult situations mixes with humor and sexuality to create a full plate of entertainment with this film. Character development is superb, making the viewing experience that much more interesting. There's not a boring part. In fact, more than one story harmoniously combines with others to engage the mind and senses. The film is not a serious drama. But it's not only a comedy. The characters are real. The humor flows naturally. Even though I know how the story ends, I'll watch it over and over 
My partner and I really enjoyed this movie there are alot of issues that we can relate to. Judy gives trans gender people a good name. All the caracters rolls are positive and I think that it shows its not all about sex, there is love involved. Definetly a must see!!! 
when i first watched this movie yes i did realize it was poorly written and what ever but i love this movie because it helped me to get courage to finally tell my mom i was gay. i think this person who left the last comment was way too dramatic,they just dont know how to appreciate things, also he threw it way out of proportion by saying he should've got RENT. what a stupid idea, rent was even worse 
This really didn't help me understand the mind of lesbians. It was poorly written or acted or presented or something. I was looking for insight to try and gain appreciation for the lifestyle so that I could better understand the culture, but was left with a silly sex movie. Very disappointed. I regret the purchase... should have gotten RENT instead 
Thank God for this essentially preserved movie version of the stage hit by one of my all time favorite broadway actresses Gwen Verdon. She just lights up the screen. Bob Fosse's dances are spectacular and the music by Ross and Adler is just classic. They just don't make them like this anymore. Sheer heaven in hell-with the devil played by the incomparable Ray Walston. If you love musicals, you must add this to your collection! 
Certain movies really capture the feel of their themes, and this one is the one movie that really captures the magic of Baseball like no other. Of course there is a great moral lesson to be learned. But haven't we learned by now, that the Devil has no good purpose in wanting to help us to achieve our goals? I hope so. What a great cast of performers. Nothing was lost from the Broadway stage in this production. And nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to DVD. Through the magic of Hollywood, when done to perfection, film can even enhance the story. And few have done the job with a Musical as well as this Gem. Thanks largely to the astounding talent of Bob Fosse's choreography. Tab Hunter's shining moment. Gwen Verdon's 'Whatever Lola Wants' is the showstopper, but Ray Walston steals the entire film as an extremely funny Devil. A film favorite for most of my life 
i remeber, seeing this movie baasically, when it was first released. and as I have a large collection of musicals, I wanted to add it to my collection, as i had not seen it available in Australia. After viewing Damn Yankees after 40 50 years, was very enjoyable, Gwen Verdon great, and Tab Hunter, yes 
Once upon a time, Broadway musicals were quickly adapted into successful widescreen presentations, often, but not always, with the original Broadway stars. This is an example of one of Hollywood's best. A previous reviewer called this stagebound. I am not sure what was meant. "My Fair Lady" and "Mary Poppins" are musicals shot entirely on soundstages, and look it; "Damn Yankees!" involved several outside locations, including the old Los Angeles Wrigley Field, which was home to the Los Angeles Angels in their first season in 1961. It was a great backdrop for the "Shoeless Joe" number. The film is not in stereo (even though the CD soundtrack is); I don't know if the stereo soundtrack album would matchup with the film soundtrack, or whether there stereo tracks recorded. In any event, Warner Bros. did not dig them out, and this DVD is bereft of any significant extras. Apart from that, this is a must buy for classic performances (Ray Walston and Gwen Verdon, particularly), wonderful songs ((You Gotta Have) Heart, Shoeless Joe, etc.), and some great smaller roles (the crusty Senators' manager, Jean Stapleton playing Edith Bunker 15 years before she played Edith Bunker, and Bob Fosse dancing with Gwen Verdon) 
Gwen Verdon at her finest. Great performances by an amazing cast. Great music and incredible choregraphy. Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse - such a team 
The audio/video quality of the original movie is not quite up to modern picture and sound standards, and the original play and movie we indelibly tied to the 50's scene ("Cool, man"), but the transition to DVD has not hurt it a bit. The songs and dancing are very stylized, definitely reflecting Donen's handicraft. Seeing the actors when they were almost kids is very interesting. I definitely enjoyed it 
This classic show was skillfully brought to film and the casting is great. Gwen Verdon is fabulous as Lola and Ray Walston as the Devil is superb. Well worth having for collectors of American Musical Theater 
Thankfully unlike other movies that I remembered seeing years ago this one lived up to expectations with Ray Walston as the Devil stealing the show 
Ray Walston is perfect as the endearingly likable devil, Gwen Virdon is teriffic as Lola the vamp and Tab Hunter is perfectly believable as Joe Hardy. Great dancing, great songs "Gotta have heart," "Whatever Lola Wants" and "Two Lost Souls" great love story and great actual shots of Mickey Mantle and Gil MacDougald in action makes for a winner 
With an all-star cast, direction with the artistry characteristic of a Spike Lee joint, and a plot with so many twists and turns it was hard to guess the ending, Inside Man is an above-average heist thriller. However, as many reviewers have pointed out it is from a director who makes a habit of underlying his story with social commentary, and Inside Man is no exception. At times it seemed as if the movie was supposed to serve as an expose on the importance of wealth in contemporary America. From a child's violent video game whose point is to get rich or die trying, to a wealthy mogul who made his fortune from one of the worst tragedies in history, Lee makes a point of showing that all that glitters is not gold. I liked that part of the movie, but I can understand how others are bored with Lee's tactics. Overall, the plot, direction, and all-star cast are the most stellar parts of this film and they are reason enough to give it a chance 
If you like action, shooting, explosions, fire, pain, torture and revenge, this is a movie you'll love. And, it stars one of the best actors in the world who is completely believeable in this role. A great storyline with intriguing twists plus situations and settings that are very close to reality. 
Spike Lee finally came through on his fourth film with Mr. Washington. This film is very moving and intriguing. Nail biting. Exciting. Smart casting and directing. Clive Owen wanted to help out those who deserve it, unlike the big tycoon entrepreneur...selling himself out and trying to hide his past. This film demonstrated that everyone has demons, and no matter how hard someone tries to hide the past, and how rich you are...there will be someone out there who is smarter and willing to take even bigger risks to reward himself and at the same time reveal the true meaning of pride. Furthermore, Jodie was playing a dirty lawyer. Stopping at nothing to achieving her greed on the front page and scoring points to achieve the unremarkable...betrayal. This film had all aspects of our human nature. What more can anyone ask for. It makes you think...Would you risk your life to prove that someone else's life is worth more than yours if you get caught? 
NEED I SAY MORE---GOOD LIKE EVERYMOVIE HE ACTS IN--GOOD STORY LINE WITH A TWIST.. 
The acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on. I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot. Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a "s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them. They were disguised as painters. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine. Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent. 
One of Denzel's finest movies, but anything he's in has to be good or better 
"Inside Man" unfolds its characters and plot in seeming slow-motion -- perhaps a bit like a real-life hostage drama. The film's plot advances by millimeters, in a seemingly unknowable direction. Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings. A well-planned hostage situation develops at a New York City bank. Dozens of hostages are taken, and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence. Keith Frazier, an NYPD detective and hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington, is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis. But this is no ordinary hostage situation, as the hostage-takers aren't playing by the normal rules. What are they after? Why are they stalling for time? The bank's philanthropist owner (Christopher Plummer) has taken an unusual interest in the situation. When he contacts a high society fixer (Jodi Foster) to retrieve property from the besieged bank, it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank. Foster, Washington and the lead hostage taker (played with intelligence and canny reserve by Clive Owen) soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity. Spike Lee's cinematography is terrific. A long shot of the Brooklyn Bridge is just one of many ornaments to this well-made film. The writing and the plot are believable -- and hold back on the unrelenting sarcastic chatter that makes up so many forgettable cop movies. The final plot lines are not tied up until literally the final few seconds of the film. Other than the pace of the film -- which mimics the wait-and-see pace of real negotiations (but is slow to the point of torpor) -- "Inside Man" is brilliant 
I've seen quite a few movies trying to win the title "The prefect bank robbery" for the crime they describe. This one wins the jackpot. The robbery's whole concept is ingenious. Just when I thought there couldn't be any real innovations in this field comes "Inside Man" to show me how wrong I was. From the beginning to the end, this film is nothing but professional and completely believable - I watched the screen and said to myself: "for heaven's sake, people could actually pull it off!". Add to that the top notch cast - Denzel Washington, Judie Foster and Clive Owen - and you get a film you wouldn't want to miss. 
I have seen the original Dutch version by Director Sluizer, and this one holds up quite well on its own. Jeff Harriman (Kiefer Sutherland) stops at a gas station with his girlfriend Diane (Sandra Bullock). In a matter of minutes, she disappears without a trace. And although Jeff searches everywhere for her, she vanishes without ever being heard from again. He lives every moment of his life trying to locate her. Putting flyers everywhere, and even going on TV. The abducter of Diane is Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). I don't wish to give away the plot about what happened to her, however, I will write that Barney contacts Jeff and tells him that he admires his persistence in trying to locate Diane after so many years. He gives Jeff a chance to experience what happened to Diane, but at a cost. Enter Rita Baker (Nancy Travis) who is also the latest love interest of Jeff. Her role in the film is very important. Barney Cousins is a sociopath, and he has been abducting women for some time. How long, the viewer is never told, but it is not a spur of the moment type of abduction. He is very methodical. As I wrote in the beginnig, I have seen the original, and while it is quite good, this film also is a very good and suspenseful film. The character of the sociopath, played by Jeff Bridges is very good. He is very convincing in his part. As for Kiefer Sutherland, I thought he gave a very good performance. Disregard some of the negative reviews on this film. Just because the original is on Criterion, and in Dutch, does not necessarily negate this very good and suspensful film. I have the DVD, but it is only listed on VHS at amazon. It might be out of print. If you can, grab the DVD; I assure you that you will not be disappointed. [Stars: 4.5] 
An extraordinary film, The Vanishing, brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the American Northwest. The movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller type of category. Kiefer Sutherland, Jeff Bridges, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! The setting, the plot (Jeff's strong sense of love, devotion, and determination are admirable and commendable, and an example for all to follow!), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! In short, The Vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 
This movie starts a little slow, but builds quickly into a suspenseful thriller. Bridges does an excellent job playing a psycho and masterfully pulls off that little "thing" that just makes him creepy. Typical of an early 90s thriller, this movie is sure to entertain. If you liked "Fear" then you will like "The Vanishing" as well 
George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered. Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one. 
In 1988, director George Sluizer had directed a film entitled, THE VANISHING. The film was all in Dutch and starred Dutch actors, who are nowhere near well-known in this country. In 1993, director George Sluizer, who had directed the original Dutch film, had decided to direct a remake of his own film, this time, casting a well-known cast that consists of Kiefer Sutherland, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Bridges. The film is almost the same as the original Dutch version, but this one is much more worth the time and money. JEFF HARRIMAN (played by Kiefer Sutherland) and his girlfriend, DIANE SHAVER (played by Sandra Bullock) are driving to the mountains for vacation. They have a little spout, after their car runs out of gas, while in a dark tunnel. Leaving Diane there, Jeff heads off to get enough gas to drive them to a nearby gas station. He comes back to find Diane sitting outside the other end of the tunnel, upset and distraught. They pull into a gas station, where Diane has Jeff, who laughs with cheerfulness, repeat an apology. They kiss passionately, where Diane heads into the store to buy her and Jeff some cold beers. A half-hour goes by and Diane has not yet returned. He searches the store, as well as the whole ground, but Diane is nowhere to be found. Three years later, Jeff is still on the hunt for his beloved girlfriend. Every month for the last three years, Jeff would renew the posters he had printed of Diane. He has even gone to the local newspapers and national television news stations and pleaded with the person who had kidnapped Diane to tell him where she is. He walks into a diner one night, still very miserable, and meets RITA BAKER (played by Nancy Travis). Rita is instantly attracted to Jeff. Jeff and Rita begin a love affair together. Jeff tries to move on with his life, but he cannot, for he is still searching for Diane. Rita finds out about what Jeff is doing behind her back. She tries to help get over his obsession, but it doesn't work. Jeff receives a letter from a man named BARNEY COUSINS (played by Jeff Bridges). Jeff shows Rita the letter, but she realizes that his obsession is still going on, where she leaves him. She goes to their appartment, packs her things, changes the outgoing message on their answering machine. Jeff returns home and changes the machine himself, but as the recording is still going, Barney appears. Jeff beats the hell out of him, but Barney reveals that he can tell him where Diane is, and that in order for Jeff to find out what happened to her, he'd have to ride with Barney. While at a bar with her girlfriend, Rita calls her appartment to let her girlfriend her the outgoing message, but Rita hears that Jeff had already changed it, to which she finds Barney's voice on the machine. She realizes that Jeff is in danger and rushes over to help him, but Jeff and Barney are already on their way. Rita finds out what happened from her neighbor, where her neighbor gives Rita the license plate number to Barney's car. With this License Plate #, Rita finds out where Barney lives and drives off to his place. Jeff and Barney arrive at the gas station where Diane was last seen three years earlier. Barney hands Jeff a cup of coffee, where Barney informs Jeff that the coffee is drugged. He tells Jeff that in order to find out what happened to Diane, Jeff has to go through the exact same details that Diane had gone through. Jeff, through hurtful tears, drinks the coffee and blacks out. He wakes up to darkness. He flips on his lighter to find himself locked...in a coffin and...buried alive outside Barney's vacation cabin in the woods. Barney had done this to poor Diane, who, after three years of being buried in the ground without anyone coming to her aid, is now dead. Rita arrives at Barney's house, where she meets Barney's daughter, DENISE (played by Maggie Linderman). She asks Rita to giver her a ride to the carnival, as long as she doesn't say a word to to Barney. Rita asks Denise how to get to the summer cabin where Barney is at. Denise gives her the directions and Rita is on her way. She arrives and has a brief brawl with Barney. She stops when he is about to kill her. She is now seated inside his cabin, talking with Barney, trying to find out what he did with Jeff. She notices the dirt on his shoes, the dirt on a shovel, standing beside the door, and realizes that she had seen a long spot on the ground without grass, and realizes that Barney had buried Jeff alive. She knocks Barney and begins digging up Jeff. But not before Barney awakens and begins brawling again with Rita. Did Jeff suffocate and bite the dust as Diane had done? Will Barney kill of Rita as well? The only way to find is to watch this 1993 remake of THE VANISHING. I have read the reviews from many Amazon.com reviewers and I cannot believe that anyone would hate this remake. So what? The ending was changed. I do not find that a good enough reason to hate this movie. This movie was just outstanding and was much better than the remake. Kiefer Sutherland, again, proves that he is the best actor on this planet, maybe even in this whole galaxy. This movie is one Kiefer's best starring roles and I recommend it to any Kiefer Sutherland fan who has not yet seen this film 
This movie maybe a remake, but it keeps you at the edge of your seat. You don't ever want to get up. You always want to know what is going to happen next. It is a great mystery and it is very realistic! 5 stars for a great movie 
Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD? Seriously? The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's. This isn't a matter of comparison. This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie. Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie. And the ending. Oh, the ending. We've been cheated. Totally cheated. All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome. Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK! Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated. This is [...]of a great movie. 
I glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is "intellectual" because it is made anywhere but the USA. In their eyes America can do no right. My other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame. 
Boyz n the Hood was one of the most important movies of the 1990's. It is both an excellent movie about life in the mean streets of the inner city as well as a reinforcer of the moral values needed to turn around the situation in Urban America where youth gangs run rampant. During the course of the story, it offers much needed commentary on the situation that young people find themselves in and how they can get out of it. At the start of the movie there is a subtitle that says "One out of every 21 black males will be murdered in his lifetime, most will be killed at the hands of another black male." If anything, that fact is even worse today. Most flicks today that are about the inner city crime scene have taken many of their concepts from this film, but many of these films today are all shoot `em up movies that have no morality, strong plot or serious social message. The setting of this flick is South Central L.A.: Where murder rates are five times the nationwide average, or in absolute figures, double the entire U.S.'s death rate for breast cancer. Over the past two decades the Los Angeles Police Department has accumulated a backlog of 4,400 unsolved homicides - roughly 3/4ths of the city's total. This gripping tale evolves around a single black father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), raising his one and only son, Trï¿½ Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and installing in him the values to help him become a man. This is an important point that director John Singleton took time to illustrate since the majority of men in the black community are often raised by their single mothers. The values that Furious Styles instills in Tre are generally not portrayed in most movies today. Essentially, Boyz n the Hood is a movie about peace. Its message is that violence isn't the answer, and this movie shows the effects of violence being what residents of the inner city all too frequently resorts to when there are other alternatives available. The movie starts when Tre's mother sends him to live with his father Jason, a/k/a "Furious", who is much better equipped to raise a son in a neighborhood like this. The movie quickly moves forward seven years when seventeen year old Tre and his best friend Ricky about to graduate from high school, while another friend Doughboy has already graduated - from shoplifting to guns and small-time drug deals. And while Furious guides Tre towards moral choices, responsibility and self-respect, Doughboy and Ricky are raised by a mother who lacks the capacity to instill proper values and morals in her offspring. The basic plot to Boyz n the Hood is can Tre avoid the crime and drug scene and live a normal, decent life? This is all the more challenging given all the crime and violence around him. Boyz n the Hoodis an excellent film that is a drama based on real human beings. It shows the dire straits that folks in the South Central are in without being conscending or exploitative. Boyz n the Hood is a flick that is well written, acted and directed. The cinematography is stunning 
This is truly a BRILLIANT movie in that it lets one have an unvarnished look into how the "real" hood is really like. For me this was nothing less than educational. I could see how individuals may be caught in a web of circumstances and locale (the hood) which they are powerless to escape or ignore. This is more than just a movie, it is a powerful statement by a visionary director that tears the stereotyes down, and exposes the humanity of the characters. When watching the movie, I could clearly relate to the characters and feel their pain and anguish --- these were not just thugs and criminals from a poor neighborhood, but humans with hopes, feelings and aspirations, just like you and me. What more can I say, except: BRAVO! 
This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings. This movie truly captures the struggle millions of African Americans go through. As we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto, to when they are old enough to get out, they still seem to be the same. Their customs dont change, simply because of their surrounding, guns, liquor, poverty, and crime. They have no other option than do join in. When dough boy's(Ice Cube) brother Ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto. The whole family feels as this a way for them to escape it also, so everyone is supporting him. Until a tragedy is brought upon the family. This story truly proves nothings good until finally out of the hood for these boys. 
he kept it real thats all i can say. aw yeah those people talkin bout its too much cussin. what u expect im from the hood and every other word i say is a cuss word. i just cant help it. everybody in the hood cusses. but anyways.. 
Good movie from the 1990s years,Tre has to live with his dad after getting into a fight with Bobby the boy he walked to school with, I like the part when Tre,ricky,doughboy and little Chris(or Chris)were young.The part when Doughboy said she loved that fool more than she loved me. I think it was pretty obvious.I think he said fool but if he did that ment ricky.But you know what ever!I know part of this review sounds stupid 
Despite what some people might think, Boyz N The Hood is in no way a film that glorifies a gangsta lifestyle. It is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in America. I would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie. This was John Singleton's first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then 22 year old could write such a powerful script. Every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them, Cuba gooding Jr is superb as Tre Styles, a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father Furious (Lawrence Fishburne). Furious is also played excellently by Fishburne, despite appearing as strict, he keeps Tre on the right path and as a 17 year old Tre is a mature and well rounded individual. Tre's friends are brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) Ricky (Morris Chestnut), two very different people, Ricky like Tre is an aspiring college student, while Doughboy is fresh out of jail, and looked down upon by his mother. The script is so well written that even a character like Doughboy can be sympathised with, though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface, he is also loyal and caring to his friends. It is the depth of all the characters, and several superb acting performances that make the film so great. I don't want to give away any plot details for those who haven't seen it, but the film is really tragic in the end, and is a realistic take on life in the hood in South Central. I don't care where your from or what colour your skin is, you can enjoy and be moved by this film, a true masterpiece 
Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
Boyz N the Hood is an oustanding movie about a young man named Tre Styles who grows up on the hostile and violent streets of South Central Los Angeles. After a confrontation with a classmate at his school, Tre's mother forces him to go and live with his father Furious. She says, " The last thing I want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed. Look at me, I'm serious. I love you. You're my only son." She just can't take his problems anymore. After being dropped off at his fathers place, Tre grows through 5 more years of seeing what hood life is really like making him about 13 years old. All the while Furious tells Tre, "You know Tre you may think I'm being hard on you right now, but I'm not. What I'm doing is trying to teach you how to be responsible. Its like your little friends across the street, they don't have anybody to show them how to do that. And you're gonna see how they end up too." His next door neighbors Chris, Doughboy, and Ricky are very close and all grow up together learning how to survive the streets. Ricky is a high school all star football player and scholar who hopes to get into USC on a scholarship. Meanwhile his brother doughboy on the otherhand becomes a thug involved with a gang (the crips), pushing drugs, boozing 40s (OE), and running his mouth. Ricky and Tre both want to make something of their future while doughboy is just trying to survive. One night at the strip on Crenshaw, a group of bloods are strolling through, and one of them bumps into Ricky on purpose trying to start crap. He says, "F*** you lookin at nigga?" Ricky shouts back, "I'm still trying to find out nigga!" Doughboy hears the confrontation taking place, rushes up with his homeboys right by his side and says "We got a problem here? We got a problem? He pulls aside his coat flashing a .45 concealed in his pants and flashes gang signs. The bloods flash gang signs back. Doughboy pulls back the slide on his gat (cocking it). The gangsters give him a dirty look, turn their backs and walk away. Right when the crowds are ready to leave, the bloods open the trunk of their tricked out hyundai and fire a fully automatic uzi in the air. Ricky and Tre drive off together saying, "can't go nowhere without getting all shot up and crap." They get pulled over and hassled by the cops. Tre drives over to his girlfriends house and he shows sad and angry emotions. She comforts him and they end up making love.  About 15-20 minutes near the end of the movie, Rickys wife asks him to go the the convenience store to get some cornmeal. He walks a few blocks from his house with tre and walks out of the store with the cornmeal, a container of milk, and several lottery tickets. Ricky and Tre are walking back home and Ricky is totally unaware that his SAT scores for college are waiting for him when he gets home. He scored just enough to get him accepted into USC. The red hyundai pulls up on a side street and the bloods inside are saying, "Theres that bastard that was talking smack the other night." The gangsters grab their guns and the car peels out around the corner catching Ricky and Tre running and ducking into an alley near a wooden fence down the street. The fellas inside the car are shouting, "Cut him off man. Lets kill him. Come on man, go." The leader of the gang steps on the gas and the car races down the street after them. Doughboy and his homies are waiting on the porch chilling when the red car races past with its system booming. Doughboy knows something is up and he races inside, grabs his gat, and the guys jump into the car, racing to find Ricky Tre. Ricky and Tre are walking down the alley. Ricky is finishing scratching off his lottery ticket when the car full of bloods pulls up. Tre shouts, "RICKY!" Ricky sees the car, drops his bag, and runs as fast as he can away from the car. By that time it is too late. A 12 gauge shotgun gets raised and blasts two shots. The first one hits him in the legs to cripple him and the 2nd shot hits him blowing a hole in his chest, knocking him to the ground.  There is so much blood all over. Tre tries to comfort him Ricky and keep him concious as Doughboys car pulls up. Ricky dies in Tres arms and they take him home. Rickys mother comes unglued and the mom thinks that Doughboy is the one who shot him. She starts beating on him like crazy. Tre pulls him away from her on the porch. Tres clothes are covered from head to toe in blood and he tells Doughboy "meet me at my house in 5 minutes." Tres girlfriend tries to stop him to see whats up and he tells her to go home. Tre walks into his fathers bedroom and loads a .357 magnum. He wants to kill the guys responsible for murdering his best friend right in front of him. Furious does his best to stop Tre from commiting murder by confronting him in the living room and demands him to hand the gun over. Tre falls into his dads arms and begins sobbing. His dad says, "Your my only son and I'm not gonna lose you to any crap. I love you man. Go clean yourself up. Go on." Tre goes back to his bedroom knowing that his buddies are outside waiting for him in the car. He jumps out the window and runs to the car jumping in the back of the car. They race off and his father and buddy Chris are thinking, "oh shoot." Tres father is very nervous because he knows what the guys plan to do after the tragic bloody afternoon. Tre does a lot of thinking in the backseat and orders his friends to pull over the car and let him out. They do as he wants. The guys in the car let him out and they drive off into the night looking for the thugs who murdered his friend. They pull into a burger joint and find the gangsters outside eating burgers at a table. They load cock a fully automatic AK-47, turn off the lights on the car, and pull a drive by shooting on every single person at the table. The car comes to a screeching halt, doughboy cocks his sidearm and runs up to the surviving gangsters and murders every single one of them in cold blood. They peel out of the parking lot and the following morning Tre ends up talking to Tre about how hard it is to break the cycle of violence growing up in the hood. Doughboy says, "They sure pushed the clock on Rick man. I ain't got no brother. Next thing you know somebody might try to smoke me. Don't matter though. We all gotta go sometime huh?" Tre tries to comfort him by saying, "Hey dough. You still got one brother left man." Doughboy says, "Thanks man." Doughboy and Tre embrace with a hug. Doughboy walks away pouring out his bottle of OE as an homage to his mudered brother and then a message comes up on the screen saying "2 weeks later doughboy is murdered." How sad. Personally I didn't like the ending. It wants to get out the message that the violence never seems to stop. Tre his girl survive and go to college out of state later in the fall. A very powerful and moving story that should be shown to every young man woman near high school age. Although the movie has a lot of language and is very violent, it has an important message that needs to get across to everyone. "INCREASE THE PEACE 
this iz da best drama movie of all time.Itz da truf nigga!!!! if ya black you must see it, if ya any other race go see it and see what black people has to go through in life. 
What I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is "I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job." How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, "I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too." I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how "real" Furious was. "Young" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it's success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today. 
"The Sentinel" isn't a movie I entirely expected to like, although I've wanted to see it since it was in theatres. Even though the plot is different, it kept bringing to mind another movie released this year called "Firewall." Even while watching this movie, I thought it was similar to "Firewall" in many ways...But I also found myself entertained by it. Now presidential assassination movies are almost a cliche by now; but a few good ones do come around. My favorite movie of this kind is "In the Line of Fire." It was entertaining, well acted, made sense, and was a great film. The Sentinel has good performances, it's entertaining, but it doesn't always make sense. It's never really explained why the people in this film want to kill the president. Even if they just want to do it to do it, they could've told us that. Inside Man told us the bankrobbers just wanted to do it in the beginning. Anyway, Oscar winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, 'Wall Street') plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who once took a bullet for Ronald Reagan. Years later, Pete is having an affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger) and is at odds with his former best friend David Breckinridge (a marvelous Kiefer Sutherland), also a Secret service agent. See David is under the impression that Pete had an affair with his wife. Anyway, through a rat, Pete discovers that there's a mole in the Secret Service who's helping terrorists plot to kill the President. At the same time, Pete is getting anonymously blackmailed for his affair with the first lady and, as a result of that, evidence is piling up on the fact that Pete maybe the mole. Now with the entire Secret Service after him, including David and his new partner Jill (Eva Longoria, who's got some good acting chops away from Wisteria Lane). This movie has its share of cliches. There was a few times where I was watching this movie and thinking to myself "that sounds/looks familiar." I saw the end coming from a mile away. But, the ending quickly redeems itself (from my point-of-view anyway) with the relationship between Pete and the first lady not going in the direction you'd think. A lot of people won't like this film for reasons I've mentioned and more...But if you want some semi-mindless entertainment (although this movie has its smart characteristics blending in with its flaws), then The Sentinel is actually a pretty good way to pass the time. Due to its flaws, with only the fact that I enjoyed it to support my case, I should give it 4 stars...But I think that it's worthy enough of 5. Entertainment goes a long way. GRADE: A 
I actually liked this movie and I don't understand the bad reviews maybe they were expecting a smarter movie I don't know. Anyways the plot was easy to follow and made some sense and the action was okay. I am not going into the movies detail because I don't want to ruin the story for somebody. I will recommend this movie to people and most will enjoy it but those crazy people that like perfect movies and complain about every detail will not enjoy it all. Rent it then maybe buy it if you like it 
Very good ,bu not as good as the other films of Michael Douglas.I dont understand the price.Why full screen is higher price than widescreen 
Frankly, the idea of a Secret Service Agent having an affair with the President's wife is way out there in the first place. (Michael Douglas not withstanding). If you like Keefer Sutherland (as in TV's 24) you will probably like this movie (his name could have been Jack Bower in this flick too. I thought it had good action, writing, acting and directing. I would not mind seeing Keefer and Michael teamed up again on the same side. I bought the dvd, but then again I collect movies for the actors. 
i purchased this movie basically to see my favorite chick Eva longoria but i ended up loving the movie i would recommend it to anyone 
Good movie, have always been a fan of michael douglas again he has done some fine work 
Kiefer Sutherland does his usually excellent job and Michael Douglas was also very good. 
I cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received. Were they watching the same movie I was watching? I generally concider myself very critical when it comes to political thrillers such as "The Sentinel", so I am not going to just generally give such a movie of one of my favorite genres a high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought. "The Sentinel" is everything that an intense, well-crafted political thriller should be. The acting is quite convincing and the suspense is riveting. I guarantee you will be pinned to the edge of your seat through the entire film and then some. Also, the scenario is extremely plausible, especially in today's world, with all the militant groups out there--from neo-Nazis to Islamic radicals--who would stop at nothing to make an assination attempt or terrorist attack against the President or some U.S. institution. My advice is, before listening to the negative rants of the other reviewers of this film, go ahead and take a look at it yourself. It's a safe bet that you will not be disappointed. 
I own the first two volumes of the Lost Treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat. They are brilliant and I hope more volumes appear on a regular basis. Why though, must I suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get The Plays volume without buying them all over again? I suspect (and hope) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime I can only say that if you don't already own any of these and are a fan of Broadway, theatre or the performing arts in general, buy this today! A fantastic showcase of theatrical talent 
I can't write a review because I had to send both CD's back because they would not play. I just ordered another one yesterday, and here's hoping that will be okay 
Being a farm boy from Illinois, "the-ay-ter" could have been in a foreign country and I would have never been wiser. Area schools performed shows written especially for high schools (like "Mississippi Melody" and "Up On Old Smokey"). In 1971, I had just purchased a state-of-the-art reel to reel tape recorder and was anxious to do a bit of experimentation with it. As fate would have it, I saw an ad on CBS for the 1971 Tony Awards telecast and thought I'd see what kind of sound quality I would get from the tinny little speaker on the television. I had no idea the format for that year was to perform 1 song from each award-winning show using as many of the original cast members as possible. Even though the sound quality was far less than perfect, I realized I had an audio tape of more original cast members singing songs from Broadway shows than I could shake a stick at. And many of the songs were familiar from television variety shows like Ed Sullivan etc. I went away to college taking my recording with me and thoroughly annoyed my dormmates with it. It was good to listen to while cleaning my room--but I had the advantage that I could recall what was on the television screen. Reel-to-reel fell by the wayside for 8-track, cassette tapes, and finally cd. The tape became brittle and would break many times over and electronic manufacturers slowly pulled reel-to-reel from the market. Now, 30 years later, I'm actually seeing the performances again (remember this was YEARS before home video recordings). The 1971 broadcast is heavily used throughout Broadway's Lost Treasures I, II and III. The telecast that year used the giant lighted years as the backdrop for the songs. Plus I found out that things like a "clunk" in the audio of "If I Were A Rich Man" was not caused by me--but it was Zero Mostel hitting the stage wagon with his shoe. One performance I can recall in particular that has not been used (yet) is the one where the female announcer says: "...then came the sparkling 'High Button Shoes' and every bit as lovely then as she is now: Nanette Fabray..." (So I guess there's still enough material out there for "Broadway's Lost Treasures IV"). Get all 3 dvds for your collection because it's nice to have something when you simply want to be entertained and don't want to be bothered with a story line. 
Mandy Patinkin was shown only in one small part of "Evita." That was very disappointing and I thought by the title he would be one of the hosts or at least a larger segment of him in "Evita." So why was he advertised in the title? The show was put together very well and the quality of the color and the production is excelent. It had a 3D effect which is very prominent, especially, with the hosting of Jerry Orbach. The shows chosen were all of my favorites and so I was pleased with that part of the CD. But not enough of Mandy Patinkin. I don't think that you should advertise this CD by using Mandy's name as a come on. It sure fooled me. 
I ordered this DVD when it first came out and I've been enjoying it ever since. All the performances are enjoyable- some more than others, but they are all wonderful nonetheless. Some of my pesonal favorites include: Patti Lupone bringing down the house along with Mandy Patinkin and Bob Gunton doing the song "A New Argentina" from Evita. This is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this DVD. Anegela Lansbury providing a hilarious performance in "The worst Pies in London" from Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street Carol Channing singing the nothing-less-than inspirational "Before the Parade Passes By" from Hello, Dolly! Yul Brynner performing "Shall We Dance?" with his co-star (not sure of her name). This performance is priceless and so is that dress! John Raitt's beautiful baritone voice soars in this song-"Hey There" from The Pajama Game Paul Lynde delivers a ton of laughs in "Kids" from Bye Bye Birdie Joel Grey and cast perform the spectacle that is Cabaret in the song "Willkommen". This song never gets out of your head! Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera- two of Broadway's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from Chicago: "All That Jazz" and "Nowadays". Bob Fosse's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment. Jerry Orbach. His death was a tragic loss to the theater. That's why these DVD's are so remarkable. This is another top performance- the song "Lullaby of Broadway" from 42nd Street. It was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to NYC to see my very first broadway show- 42nd Street. Andrea McArdle and the orphans perform "Tomorrow" and "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from Annie. This is just superb. There's absolutely no flaws. Betty Buckley and cast perform two songs from Cats-"Jellicle Songs" and the classic "Memory". It is stunning to watch. Any performance with Patti LuPone in it is a gem in itself. This one- "Buenos Aires" from Evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of Eva Peron. Bonnie Franklin and cast are hilarious in the song "Applause" from the show Applause. The whole theme to the song is 100% true and kind of "hits home" for every actor. Plus, it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you're a big fan of musicals. All in all, this DVD is totally worth buying! And after you're through with this one and have memorized all the songs, check out Broadway's Lost Treasures II. I have yet to receive III, but I am looking forward to it!    
I was at the '71 Tony Awards, broadcast in March of 1971, and I thought the marvelous night would have to live on in my memory. And, then, lo and behold...we get this marvelous record of theater history. Many of the performances were from the '71 broadcast..Zero Mostel, John Raitt, Robert Preston, Carol Channing, which was the Silver Anniversary of the Tony's, full of legendary performances from the history of the musical theater. I'm so looking forward to the other DVD's of performances that were not included. If you want to see the legends of Broadway perform their signature songs, then this is the tape for you 
i saw this show on PBS and was so enthralled with it that i just had to order it. the performances are priceless from folks who have passed on. i don't know of any other way to be able to see Yul Brynner's commanding King and I performance. Loved it 
If you're a fan of musical theatre, you're almost guaranteed to find something you like on this DVD. Although the presentation is cheesy (with some awful bluescreen effects), the musical numbers themselves are entertaining. Highlights include Patti LuPone in Evita, Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera in Chicago and Bonnie Franklin in Applause. But for me, as a fan of both the musical theatre and science fiction, the higlight was seeing a young Nana Visitor (Major Kira on Star Trek Deep Space Nine) dance her little heart out in an impressive dance number from My One and Only. In this particular number, you will also see a less than comfortable Twiggy trying to keep up with the rest of the dancers. She looks so out of place next to Tommy Tune. One of the few performances I didn't like was Betty Buckley singing Memory from Cats. Her singing was okay, but I just didn't buy her as a "cat"... Other than that, this DVD should warm the hearts of musical lovers around the world 
It is very exciting to see these performances for the first time. I am more of a fan of Wicked and Hairspray but this was great! Too good to be true. I could have skipped the talking in between as it seemed forced and this is really one you buy just to see these stars doing what they are famous for. I love Mandy Patinkin and wish they still made musicals so he could be doing more of them in movies. Where was he in "Chicago"? I mean Richard GERE? 
"The Living Daylights" is actor Timothy Dalton's first outing as the British super spy. He replaced Roger Moore, whom I regretfully have never seen in a Bond film. Actually, I've only seen 3 Bond films prior to this one. (Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever). One thing most Bond fans agree on is that Sean Connery was the best James Bond. I'd say that's accurate, but Dalton's approach to the character is far different from what we've previously seen. James Bond is, overall, an under developed character. He's a super-spy who loves martinis and women. In the films I've seen, James Bond is given no back story and shows little human emotion. Don't get me wrong, in this film there's no back-story either...But there is a little emotion. Anyway, the film has a great opening sequence; But, as usual, this sequence has little to do with the rest of the plot. It's merely used to get the audiences pumped for the rest of the story. The story involves Bond being hired as a sniper to protect a Russian officer named Georgi Koskov. Koskov is afraid that he is being targeted by a sniper; Bonds orders are to shoot any sniper he sees that poses a threat to Koskov. Well, Bond does see a sniper. Only the sniper is in the form a beautiful cellist named Kara (Maryam d'Abo, a really hot Bond girl). Making a last minute decision, Bond opts not to kill Kara and instead just wounds her. He then transports Koskov to a remote hiding spot. Koskov is then abducted from his hiding place and it's up to Bond to find him. As he does, with Kara's help of course, he uncovers a semi-complex weapons scheme. The plot is really nothing special, overall, but back to Dalton. In the previous Bond films, Bond usually woos a Bond girl and beds her. In this film, Bond seems to fall in love with her. Of course, there's no exchange of "I Love You" here; But the romance is a little different. The action sequences are good and the art direction is fantastic. It's nice to Bond in a normal place, like a fair. The scene where Bond and Kara have to escape from an Afghanistan prison is exciting. The film does have it's spot where it lags, but this is a worthy entry in the series. Hell, it's just nice to see a different side of James Bond. Another thing this film does is show a little more skin then you're used too. All the other Bond films use mere sexual innuendo; In this film, you actually side-nipple. GRADE: B+ 
The strong plot deals with a nasty agreement between a weapon ` mercenary and a Russian General, both of them are engaged in a dark red of corruption and illegal trades. Bond will have to face them until unmasking. This saga is loaded with admirable sequences, fabulous landscapes and an intriguing script. The first incursion of Timothy Dalton was very gratifying, because at last Bond returns to his origins, far from being a simple Cartoon character since Moore was hired. Recommended without reserves. 
I'm sure folks getting into Bond just skip by this one coz Dalton only did two films, and the assumtion is that his movies must suck if he only lasted for two. Though Dalton isn't given much praise, I think he's quite good. In fact, to date I have not seen a lousy Bond actor. Each actor had something unique to contribute. Dalton is alot more serious, which probably seemed like a shock after people had spent a decade with the comical Roger Moore. Dalton makes a quip here and there, and of course he's required to in the scenes with Q. Otherwise, in situations where Moore would have definitely had a sarcastic remark, Dalton remains silent. Another thing-both Roger and Sean(and George for that matter) were a couple of horndogs-Dalton doesn't even seem that interested in women! Aside from scoring a chick in the precredit sequence, Dalton looks as though he's ready to settle down with the lead actress! Bond is up against a weasely Russian and a psycho arms dealer played by Joe Don Baker(Mitchell!!). John Rhys-Davies gets thrown into the mix too. It may not be quite as cool as License To Kill, but don't pass it by 
For all the annoyance Roger Moore caused many Bond fans, he was still the face of Bond for 15 years, and became our comfortable successor to the role originally helmed by Connery. Now that he FINALLY bowed out (after nearly decomposing in OCTOPUSSY and VIEW TO A KILL), the challenge was on to find the NEW James Bond. Many hoped Pierce Brosnan would step into the role at this point, but alas he was still obligated to being Remington Steele on TV. Somehow or other, Timothy Dalton got the role - a very odd choice indeed in that he never seemed to really even WANT the part! Indeed, I would have to grudgingly argue that Dalton is my least favorite James Bond - he just never seemed to own the role the way his other peers did (even Lazenby in his ONE outing). However, and ironically, his two films were some of the best the series had to offer, beginning with this definite Top Five contender. TLD represented a return to the more espionage centered feel of the novels, and really only seen in the first two Connery films, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and Moore's own FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. The main plot revolves around a power-hungry arms dealer and a secondary plot to assassinate secret agents around the world. Along the way, Bond hooks up with a would-be assassin and has one of his few on-screen monogamous relationships. This alone adds to the believability of the film. Somehow, the producers were able to delve into a rich espionage plot, yet still not skimp on the action. This film is LOADED with action, including a new gadget-filled car (one of the better ones) and several exciting sequences involving the theft and eventual crash of a transport plane. The only complaint I have with this film (aside from Dalton himself) is that the villain is pretty weak. Joe Don Baker just doesn't have the screen presence to be a villain. Ironically, he returns in GOLDENEYE and TOMORROW NEVER DIES as a good-guy, and fits THAT role much better! Jerome Krabb fairs a little better, but is generally more annoying than anything else. Marayam D'abo is nice as the Bond girl - attractive AND a good actress as opposed to the usual glamour models that may or may not be able to act (ahem - Barbara Bach - ahem). This was the first Bond to replace Moneypenny - and the actress chosen was serviceable, but with little of the memorable flair that Samantha Bond has brought to the role in the recent Brosnan films. All-in-all, and Dalton not-withstanding, this is one of the best of the series, and is a welcome return to a grittier and more believable Bond - Dalton's follow up, LICENSE TO KILL would delve even deeper into the gritty side of Bond - too bad the Brosnan films came along and took us back into Super Bond territory! 
The CD was great and extra scenes on the Cd were really good, however it could have been advertised that it was the wide screen CD and I would have bought another! So I wasted $21.00 as I have a HD TV but not wide screen. 
This is without a doubt my favorite movie out of the series. The Living Daylights is a Bond film that has depth and realism. The film isn't the typical Bond movie. It has a hardcore spy plot. Other films in the series like this includes FRWL and OHMSS. As an actor Timothy Dalton brought intensity and passion to the role. No other Bond has reacted to situations with human qualities like Dalton did. For example, in the fair scene Dalton jumps up abruptly with anger and ready to kill when he finds out that Saunders was murdered. Previous Bonds did not show emotion like this(with the exception of George Lazenby). Dalton's performance made the movie transcend the title of being "just a Bond movie". In some Bond films (especially the Bronsnan entries) the gadgets, the action, the jokes, and the escapades overpower the movie's plot. That is not the case with The Living Daylights. There is a balance between action and plot. The humor is witty without taking away from the serious nature of the film. After watching Roger Moore's parody and silliness it was refreshing to watch Dalton take a darker approach in The Living Daylights. Dalton's monogamous approach also made the film stand out. Throughout the film Bond stayed with one woman-Kara Millovy (The pre-credits woman doesn't count). Also, an important aspect to me in a Bond film is a believable down-to-earth villain. This film accomplished just that. Necros, Yogi, and Brad Wittiaker made classic intelligent villains. Cartoonish villains such as Jaws make me disgusted with the series. In conclusion, if you want parody from a Bond movie watch entries like The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, The Man With the Golden Gun, and Diamonds are Forever. However, if you want to watch a Bond movie with substance watch this movie, License to Kill, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service 
This was the first Bond film I ever watched, years ago when it premiered on ABC saturday night movies, so I have a soft spot for it. It's still definitely one of the best, with an intriguing plot that actually requires the viewer to pay attention without becoming too convoluted. Probably the most spy-centric story since From Russia With Love. Timmothy Dalton's take on 007 is the grittiest of all the Bond actors so far, and he manages to find a strong balance between realism and the larger-than-life antics of Bond. All the usual Bond trimmings are here too, including the cars, gadgets, John Barry score, and even a new actress as Moneypenny. There are some fantastic action sequences including the opening teaser, a car chase on ice, and a fight on a cargo plane. Dalton only made two 007 films before the series went on hiatus, and this is the stronger of the two. It lacks the dark tone that haunts his follow-up, Licence to Kill, and feels a bit more timeless. This is also a pretty good DVD. You get a making-of documentary, another documentary on Bond creator Ian Fleming, the retro A-Ha music video of the title song, and a fun deleted scene (probably cut as it seems like a bit of silliness leftover from the Moore years). The bad? No English subtitles, at least on my version. My version also lacks the original burned-in subtitles on an early sequence where a Russian agent seduces her supervisor to provide Bond with a distraction. It's a rather funny one-liner, and I heard MGM corrected this mistake on later pressings of the disc. The Living Daylights still remains one of my favourite Bond films, and is a must-buy for all fans. 
This is by far the best non-Connery Bond film. Timothy Dalton is brilliant in the lead role, giving Bond a menacing quality. It is a shame we only got to enjoy him as 007 in two films, because he was truly awesome. As far as the basic standards for Bond movies, this one delivers the goods; beautiful women, explosions, car chases, exotic locations...the works! And, AND, we get to see James Bond and Miriam D'Abo skiing down a mountain in a cello case! What else could you want 
The mystery of how well the new Bond would replace Roger Moore in the fifteenth "official" Bond movie was over with "The Living Daylights." The style of the movie was set with the opening scenes, where three double-0 agents parachute onto Gibraltar as part of an infiltration exercise. Unfortunately, someone in the exercise is using real ammunition, not paint balls. Timothy Dalton shows that he is made of Bond material as he jumps onto an escaping jeep and fights with the bad guy as the jeep full of explosives catches fire, flies off a cliff, and explodes, with Bond having departed in a typically clever fashion but moments before the fireball erupts. Timothy Dalton was a no-nonsense Bond in this movie. He eliminated the numerous one-liners that seemed to be a Roger Moore characteristic in favor of a leaner and meaner and much more spy-like Bond. In this first of two Bond movies Dalton had yet to achieve the presence and technique of either Sean Connery or Roger Moore, but he breathed new life into the series. The plot bears some characteristics of "A View to a Kill" in that both films portray the Soviet Union as a friendlier nation beset with evil doers who would take advantage of the kinder, gentler, Soviet Union. This time the criminals are looking to do a novel sort of bait and switch, profiting by buying drugs from Afghanistan and selling them in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the money belongs to the Soviet Union. Mixed into this plot is a Soviet defector, KGB General Koskov (Jeroen Krabb). Bond's mission was to get Koskov out of East Germany and into Berlin. However, it appears that someone wants Koskov dead, as a beautiful assassin attempts to kill Koskov as he attempts to defect. Bond has a chance to kill Kara Milovy, well played by Maryam d'Abo, but he elects to shoot the gun from her hand instead. The plot thickens during the debrief of Koskov. Koskov tells British agents that General Leonid Pushkin, played by always excellent actor John Rhys-Davies, is executing a program to eliminate Britain's secret agents. Unfortunately, KGB appears to retrieve Koskov from the English estate safe house and the British agents are unable to learn more. Bond turns to Kara Milovy. Bond leads Kara to believe he is going to get her out of the country to meet Koskov, her patron. However, Bond has yet to learn where Koskov is. What follows is an action-packed movie that is nicely plotted and interesting to the end. There is an excellent battle scene in Afghanistan (filmed in Morocco), and an even better escape scene from Afghanistan. After all that action there remains one loose end to tie up, which Bond does nicely. During the film we meet another excellent supporting actor, Art Malik as Kamran Shah, an Afghani chief. We also meet Joe Don Baker as self-centered Brad Whitaker. There is yet another version of Felix Leiter, this time a less than memorable version of Leiter. Caroline Bliss is a mediocre version of Miss Moneypenny. The special effects were much more down-to-earth versus those in "A View to a Kill." The ubiquitous Aston-Martin returns with rockets, rocket boost, outriggers, and sundry other gadgets. There is a sliding glass door used as a weapon by an assassin. The same assassin also uses a headset as an assassination tool. This film also featured exploding milk bottles. The way Koskov escapes from East Germany is excellent for at least a couple of reasons, including the use of a Harrier vertical takeoff jet. In general the special effects were well done and believable. There are a few moments where I noticed some scene glitches. It appeared that in the final scenes of the movie that there were places where the four-engine C-130 Bond was flying had two engines. In another scene in the plane Bond looks out the left window and we see fuel leaking from a tank. However, the bullet holes are on the opposite side of the tank from the window. Perhaps Bond also has x-ray eyes. In yet another scene Kara drives a jeep up the ramp of the C-130, which is impossible due to the configuration of the C-130's ramps. However, these minor errors can be forgiven as the quality of the rest of the movie is excellent. The special edition DVD includes a deleted scene where Bond rides a flying carpet. I will leave you to discover how that stunt was performed. The reason given for its deletion was the length of the movie. Keeping with the trend of having current musical artists perform the title song, A-Ha sings "Living Daylights." A-Ha was popular in Europe at the time, and had a huge hit in the United States with "Take on Me." There is irony in that the James Bond films are filmed in the same country that is the origin of Dr. Who. One could start to think that James Bond is like Dr. Who, incarnating as different people over time. Timothy Dalton was the fourth "official" Bond. Each of the Bonds has had their own style and abilities, and each have generally been well exploited. Fortunately for viewers, Timothy Dalton's Bond was a more austere Bond, living up to the tradition of the Ian Fleming novels. He was smart, athletic, and confident without being arrogant. This Bond movie remains above average for the genre, and enjoyable to watch multiple times. 
Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
This movie is really funny and Vince Vaughan is just great in it. It is good to watch when you need to laugh. 
I didn't watch this one before Because of all the hype Too many buddy comedies Were coming through the pipe This one caught me by surprise It really was first rate Two dudes who're crashing weddings So they'll always have a date Fast-talking party animals With very rigid rules Break it off before sunrise Commitment's just for fools Until one day one falls in love The other falls in lust If you want to see Vince Vaughn get hurt Then this one is a must Sometimes sappy, sometimes sweet and often lewd and loud but it doesn't stoop to flatulence so it stands out from the crowd Amanda Richards, November 5, 2006 
"Wedding Crashers" starts off slow, I thought it was going to be a disaster of a movie, but I was wrong. By the end, the story became very interesting and was very fun to watch. Yeah, this movie is overhyped a little, but it is still a really good movie. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are raally great in their roles on this film. It's not a film you have to really think about, it is just a good comedy. 
John and Jeremy party hearty crashing weddings, until, of course, the inevitable happens: They fall in love themselves. I watched this flick while planning my wedding and enjoyed it so much I've been tempted to try it...kind of sorry nobody crashed mine! Great romantic comedy. THe added features, which include Chaz' Rules Of Wedding Crashing, make this DVD well worth the buy 
The opening sequence with Dwight Yokum and Rebecca De Mornay is one of the funniest in the film. The rest doesn't live quite up to it. The movie suffers from an improbability problem. I know from working weddings like some they went to, it's not easy to sneak into a wedding, especially high profile weddings with bouncers and giant men standing at the doors looking at your invite! Besides that, I will say I enjoyed the film. It's not as funny as say, 40 Year Old Virgin, but there's some good stuff in there. Keir O'Donnell has some of the funniest moments in the film as the goth/artist/gay son of Walken. These were some of the laugh out loud moments of the film. Owen Wilson is very likable in the film as the partier-coming-to-grips with his age and wanting more out of life. He more or less plays the straight man to Vince Vaughn's antics. Vaughn speaks in lightening fast dialogue most of the movie. Funny, and good, but at times I was left scratching my head. He's a strong actor and makes strong choices in this movie. The directing by Dobkin sometimes feels less than good. Desk scenes shot with 2 cameras make it look like the actors are improvising most of their lines and leaves these "buddies" looking a bit too disconnected. Bottom Line: If you enjoy comedies, especially of this genre, see it. It is very formulatic and if you're smart, you'll know how it ends about 30 minutes into this overly long comedy. (over 2 hours) PS: Will Ferrell turns in a very odd performance as Chazz Reinhold the ultimate wedding crasher. You might feel a little dirty after watching this near out of place character. 
The Wedding Crashers is one of the modern breed of rom-coms (along with Hitch) that actually appeals to men as well as women. The formula is simple, amuse the guys by showing the male lead as a chauvenistic womaniser, then please the chicks by having him turn into the gushing romantic hero who falls for the female star. It basically means juvenile toilet humour for the first half of the film before the transition into unrealistic gushing soppy romance that never actually happens in real life in the second half. I enjoyed it, but it does get a bit sappy towards the end 
This video gives straight forward and useful information on shooting digital photography in various sports settings. I found it very useful. 
I have many books about digital sports photography and they don't even come close to this DVD in regard to practical application. The title of this DVD is so on target. It is 'simple' to use the settings suggested and it pays off immediately. This is an excellent DVD and well worth the cost. (I wish the same people made one about digital portrait photography.) To ALL Parents of Athletes: BUY THIS DVD. Only buy the books if you want to go into professional sports photography. 
Teaching photography I have seen quite a few how-to videos, and this one is the best so far. It is well thought-out and produced. It takes the view point of an amateur photographer (Mom and/or Dad photographing the kids playing various sports), but has many concepts that could just as easily apply to professionals. Equipment wise he does expect a digital SLR with a minimum of a 200mm lens. Sorry no point-and-shoots allowed. Otherwise I would highly recommend this video 
I'm new to using an SLR and this DVD was the perfect training video. This video tells you what equipment you need, how to set it up, where to position yourself, and how to shoot for the best results. With my new camera and this information, I immediately was able to produce good shots during basketball and baseball games. Well worth the money 
Of all the instruction and training I've received over the years, I thought this was one of the best, if not the best, instructional DVDs I've ever seen. Doug Jensen has really set the bar. Every aspect of it was extremely well done - scripting, structure, use of stills and video, video camera work (I'm a video producer myself, so I paid particular attention to that) audio (often a weak point in DVDs) and the use of graphics (I really liked the 'through the viewfinder' parts - where sports action video is shown framed in a SLR viewfinder) - even the glossary was helpful in reviewing terms and also the explanation of the digital photo histogram. Plus, it was loaded with tons of practical tips and advice - the kind of things that a really experienced photographer tells you one-on-one, when they want to help you out. For someone like me who is transitioning from a film 35mm SLR to digital SLR - it was really helpful to clarify the concept of EV (Exposure Value) and the interplay of ISO, shutter and aperture. Yeah, I knew what they were - but to see the relationship "in action" and how it changes from shutter priority to aperture priority (depending on the shot) really reinforced the concepts. If you buy only one resource for digital sports photography - this should be it. It has a permanent place in my DVD reference library 
I love this movie. It came out a couple of years after I personally had some what of the same experiences. I had a baby when I was 15 and my boyfriend and I split up for a short time then got back together and we are still together 20 years later (married at 17) so unlike what 'Rochelle O'Gorman' says (who gave the Editorial Review on this movie) teenage couples staying together is sometimes and can be a reality. I think it is a good moral story that shows it is possible to make it and stay together even when you do get together and have a baby young. 
For when you need a little Molly Ringwald fix that 16 candles just won't satisfy. Fantastic! 
I am MOLLY RINGWALD's Fan,I have two Laserdisc OF FOR KEEPS 1988 [ NEW ] And Used,I love it much thats why I bought it on DVD TOO,You won't regret it : 
I have always loved this movie. Too me it is a comfort movie because I have seen it so many times growing up. I recently let my 13 year old neice watch it and she loved it too. I didnt think she would like it that much because its a big time 80's flick but she loved it. Now she wants to watch it everytime she comes over 
Molly Ringwald shines in this film as she portrays a high school senior who ends up pregnant. She and the father get married and try to stick it out... she tries to work while pregnant, he tries to help his dad out... nothing seems to work. They get their own place and have to deal with their electricity being shut off so they end up moving in with her mother, which is difficult for everyone. Molly's husband has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious school and he's willing to give it up to help her with the baby, but she doesn't want him to. In the end she just about forces him to take the scholarship and he does. Mixed in with the humor and comedy, there is a great lesson on teen pregnancy and getting married young. It's harder than it looks and this is an excellent movie for young girls to watch and learn from 
This is really one of my favorite Molly Ringwald movies...of course all of them great...this one stands out a lil more ...Its a more serious role of something thats happening everyday...I was also excited this came to dvd....I give her alot of props for this one 
For Keeps where shall I start. For Keeps is one of those 80's movies that would fit perfect on The Lifetime Network. Molly Ringwald stars as Darci Elliot and Randall Batinkoff stars as Stan Bobrutz (intentional hard to spell and pronoucne name, it is the butt of several jokes in the film). The two high school sweethearts are sent fast forward into adult hood when Darci becomes pregnant. They struggle to stay together. I think this film is great because it shows young people just how hard things can be when you introduce a baby into the picture. It is not one of those happily ever after stories, Stan and Darci go through some real hard times. The movie itself takes a real awkward turn towards the end with Darci pushing Stan to pursue his dreams without his knowledge, but the movie will entertain those in 6th grade and up. Its a bit pricey but it is good for educational use and for the 80's fan building their collection 
I LOVE this movie and I was so worried it would never get to DVD since not many people have even heard of it. Its one of those movies that you can watch in your PJ's over and over. I just think of it as a comfort movie, I'm sure plenty of people would think thats crazy but I really like it =o 
I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python. While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny. The only sketches I liked were the "burger" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute). But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced. The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either. I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't. Sorry... 
I've been a Mr Show fan for decades. I saw Bob and David (not Dave) in concert in Twin Falls, Idaho back in 1989. They were a bit raw, but what they lacked in polish they made up for in sincerity and harmony. Some people want to call them the next Bob Ray or Rowan Martin or even Goldberg/Williams/Crystal. I say peeshaw! Bob has more talent in his ankle (left) than all of those jerks combined. And for David (not Dave), he's an example of how to live your life even when your body is being ravaged by HPV. I hope Lifetime will listen to its viewers and bring this back 
I had never watched Mr. Show up until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on TBS slightly edited. I was hooked and began recording every episode on Tivo, until I realized they seemed to be edited so I picked up the 4th season and loved it, there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing, my favorite being the story of Everest. I finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times, and while I found myself laughing out loud often, I didn't find this to be as clever or funny as the 4th season, aside from one or 2 sketches, not too much really stick out like the majority of season four. A must own if you're a true fan of the show, for the commentary alone 
Mr. Show, simply put, funniest, most intelligent skit show OF ALL TIME. David Cross has performed stand up in more than 109,251 comedy clubs, entertaining more that 70,000 people across the world. Bod Odenkieriertkko#^eik is SNL's grammy winning writer; nuff said. A++ = 
It could be argued that the brilliant and equally bizarre Mr Show, had a very limited, niche appeal...although I'm unsure as to why exactly. Well, that's not entirely true, as I have a pretty good idea of why that is...or was. Maybe the explanation lies within the inherent properties of average TV audiences being... well, why even delve into it, eh? Allow me to slather on high praise: I miss Bob and Dave. Bob was recently doing some late-Friday-night-oddball-flick-hosty thing on Sundance Channel. In fact, it was there that I saw the movie he directed, "Melvin Goes To Dinner," which I enjoyed. But I digress... Mr Show was original, intelligent, hysterical. Thank your lucky stars that the goodness of Mr Show's hijinks have been preserved in this format for you to enjoy whenever the mood strikes you. Break this DVD out at a party and silently muse over the obtuse, slack-jawed faces. Y'all are truly brutalizin' me. 
This is the fourth time I have watched this first and second season of Mr. Show, and I must admit, it is one of those rare programs that continues to get funnier and funnier each time that you watch it. Literally, you catch something new and fresh each time it is placed inside of your DVD player. What makes this series work better than most other television comedies out there is the chemistry of the cast. Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are perfectly matched while also being completely random choices for the hosts of the show. I had not heard about either of them before watching this series (which I bought due to a recommendation from a friend), now I have watched Melvin Goes to Dinner several times and listened to David Cross' stand-up comedy whenever I need a very social pick-me-up! Needless to say, I have full submersed myself into their world after watching this groundbreaking series. What continues to work with this program is that the jokes are not your typical slapstick humor that the average "Joe" can get from watching reruns of Friends on NBC. Mr. Show is hard hitting, in your face, political, yet not so political, social satire about the world around us. While you may just see this as just another comedy show, I see it as so much more. The cohesiveness of the skits and the underlying message throughout each show seem to represent the voices that we hear coming from our local papers on a daily basis. They are not afraid to take a delicate issue and twist it into a hysterical moment. The brutal honesty of David Cross makes this show thoroughly enjoyable while the approachable Bob Odenkirk brings it to our level. Also, the interweaving of comic geniuses throughout the show keeps you wanting more. Jack Black is a regular on the program (and really proves why he is funny), and there are appearances by Dave Foley, Sarah Silverman, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Patton Oswalt, Julia Sweeney, Janeane Garofalo, Ben Stiller, Conan O'Brien, and Andy Richter. This is not a show for everyone, but it does showcase the beauty of HBO and the ability that they have to see, and go forward, with avant-garde comedy. My favorite episodes were the News Report featured in the extras, Operation Hell on Earth, and If You're Going to Write a Comedy Scene, You're Going to Have Some Rat Feces in There, and the infamous milk machine joke song with Jack Black! Utterly hysterical. (no pun intended) This DVD set of the first and second seasons is packaged very well. With every season uncensored (were they ever with HBO), you get Mr. Show as it should be and will always be remembered. It also is chalked full of extras that will quench every drop of Mr. Show that resides in you. The news report that they do in the extras portion of this DVD is worth buying alone. Again, it shows the creativity and originality of a program that knew no boundaries. I cannot wait to get my hands on the other seasons and fully explore the world in which I live ... which is the world showcased continually on Mr. Show. The absurdity of our culture is redefined with this program. Grade: ***** out of **** 
I started watching Mr Show on HBO in it's 3rd season on HBO and loved it. I ran accross the DVD for seasons 1 2 together and in a fit of nostalgia decided to get it. It was on of the best DVD purchases I've ever made. These men are geniuses, although not everybody gets their brand of comedy. It was fun seeing Jack Black on one of the early episodes as well 
I had been aware that once there was a show called "Mr. Show", starring Bob and David, and that it had been on HBO. But I had never been compelled to buy any of their DVDs until this weekend, when the power of Satan...um, compelled me to pick up the first two seasons. All I gotta say is: Praise Satan for leading me to this glory! The first season, comprised of four episodes, is fantastic, with flashes of brilliance on "The Gay Porno Video", but it's the second season that really will make you a fan. Such oddities as F.F. Woodycooks, Only The British Can Fly, Child-Labor Comedy Writers, the Iguana, and Jeepers Creepers: Semi-Star unleash the funny like you'd never believe. Mr. Show proves that there is a market for intelligent, hilarious sketch comedy...on cable, or in the case of KITH and Monty Python, imported from other countries. But Mr. Show is homegrown, it's comedy at a breakneck speed, and there's never a dull moment in either season. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll learn how to fight crime with a "crime stick" and ice cream, and enjoy tofu-based products while your business goes to hell...led by a red balloon. "The security guard and I shared something in common...Me! 
This comedy volume is absolutely great. While I'm a fan of the series, I thought this volume was more cutting edge than the next. Definately don't watch Season 3 before seeing these seasons, because this is intellectual comedy that builds on previous episodes to some degree. It doesn't move as fast as some comedy out there, but it all fits together better than most of what is on TV today 
My favorite movie is The Diary of Anne Frank. (1959). Why? This is a movie about a 13 year old girl and her family that hides with her family and 4 other people in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to escape from the Nazis during World War 2 because they are Jewish. The characters consists of Mr., Frank, Mrs. Frank, their daughters Margot and Anne. Then there are the Van Daans, and their son Peter. Also, there is a crabby old dentist. And they have the helpers, Mr. Kraler and Miep. They help the people in the secret annex get food and clothing. Later in the movie, Anne falls in love with Peter, the Van Daans' son. They tell each other everything. *Beware, at the end, Peter and Anne kiss a couple of times, and everybody is arrested and taken to conceratiain camps. Mr. Frank is the only survivor. 
Read the book..had to see the movie. This item hardly needs my review. It is and always be one the greatist stories ever told 
Restored to its original 180 minute roadshow length (including overture and exit music), George Stevens' CinemaScope production of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK (1959, Fox) is a deeply moving and superbly acted movie experience. Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett adapted their Broadway show, with a brilliant Joseph Schildkraut (Otto Frank) and Gusti Huber (Mrs. Frank) repeating their stage roles. Added to a great cast are a very poignant and natural young Millie Perkins as Anne, Oscar winner Shelley Winters, Oscar nominee Ed Wynn in a bitter dramatic role, Diane Baker, and Richard Beymer as Anne's boy friend. It is heartrending material--a German Jewish family hiding out from the Nazis for two years in a Dutch attic, with Anne keeping a daily diary that was curiously ignored by the Nazis and has become one of the most important Holocaust documents. (Maybe the same God who unforgivably let Anne and her sister die in a concentration camp only one month before war's end helped hide her diary for posterity.) Location filming was done in the actual Amsterdam attic, with the real Otto Frank as technical advisor. The Oscar-winning B art direction re-creates the actual two story attic interior to perfection (on huge Fox sound stages), and Oscar-winning cinematographer William Mellor (PEYTON PLACE) worked miracles to make wide CinemaScope compositions look cramped and claustrophobic. Producer/director Stevens gives it all a nail-biting tension, even though we know the grim outcome because of the powerful opening and closing framing device. Bonus material is outstanding--a feature-length documentary "Echoes From the Past." new interviews with George Stevens, Jr. (who was second-unit director in Amsterdam) and a still-beautiful 66 year old Millie Perkins, and Movietone Newsreel footage. You will need two evenings for this film masterpiece that was nominated for eight Oscars the same year as SOME LIKE IT HOT, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, BEN-HUR, and ANATOMY OF A MURDER. That was some movie year! DIARY OF ANNE FRANK is an unforgettable Holocaust drama and movie experience when you have a three hour time slot. 
Detached as I am when watching movies, this one truly grabbed my heart and never stopped squeezing, the juice pouring out of my eyes in the form of sympathetic tears. This movie is great in all departments--acting, writing, directing, and editing. Based on some of the previous reviews, I expected an amaturish performance from Millie perkins. No way. She was wonderful, expressing the gamut of teenage emotions and evoking from me a caring, understanding response. Her only weakness is in her voice-over narration--it's a bit stiff, never transcending the sense of someone reading rather than just talking naturally. But this this is greatly overshadowed by the subtleties of her acting, which absorbed me thoroughly. THIS IS A MOVIE WORTH SEEING MANY TIMES--SO ABSORBING IS THE STORY AND THE CHARACTERS 
This is a beautiful and very touching dramatization about a gifted, young German Jewish girl whose family had to go into hiding in order to avoid being captured and killed by the Nazis. The characters of Miep Gies and Kraler--Otto Frank's co-workers who hid the family at this horrible time and place--are very, very positive, as well. The film stars Millie Perkins (Anne Frank,) Richard Beymer as Peter Van Daan,) Ed Wynn (Dussel) and Shelley Winters (Mrs. Van Daan) who won an award for this as best supporting actress. All were absolutely brilliant. The film is a work of art that won several academy awards. I cannot recommend highly enough this remarkable and brilliant work--as positive and human as Anne herself. 
While millions of unfortunate people were marched off to Nazi death camps during World War II, the Franks and the Van Daans savored their moment in hiding until they were discovered in August 1944 after an informer had tipped off the SS. Millie Perkins played the title role of Anne Frank, a girl in her teens who wished for a happy life and did her best to bring happiness to her family during a tumultuous time in the course of history. In the two years the eight people were cooped up in a secret hideout on the top floor of a building located in the heart of Amsterdam, Anne kept up with her education and had the dream of one day to become a writer. She began writing a diary of her daily experiences of what she learned in life and how she coped with the boredom while in hiding. She had a courtship with Peter Van Daan as their relationship grew stronger toward the end when the SS broke through the secret entrance arresting all eight people. Anne died of typhus within two months of Nazi Germany's surrender while interned at the infamous Bergen-Belzen death camp. Her father, Otto, was the only one of the eight to survive the Holocaust, returning to the former hideout where he found his daughter's diary to have it published. He resided in Canada until his death in the 1980s. I visited the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam during the summer of 1977 before seeing this film for the first time the following year. Seeing the layout of the actual hiding place, I could picture how everything was while watching the film. Though a part of history, reflecting back to that dark era is painful for some people who had experienced the Holocaust and Nazi persecutions. Someone once said of the Nazi era that it is the things we want to forget most that we try the hardest to remember. 
Is a very interesting adaptation of this famous Diary, that shows the life of Anne and her family, when they were hide from Nazis on WWII. I recommend it. Canadian and mexican customers, be careful, neither spanish or french audio tracks were included, but you can select the subtitles 
For those of you who may be reluctant to buy this because of the specifications listed on the back of the box, let me set your mind at ease. While the box states Widescreen format (Aspect Ratio 2.35:1), it is actually anamorphically (16x9) enhanced. And even though it states English stereo, it is actually dolby digital 4.0 There is no English mono or Spanish and French language tracks. And the commentary track includes Millie Perkins even though she's not listed. The movie looks beautiful and sounds great 
My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss. Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD. Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion. Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it. One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld. The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it. According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history. So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge. On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a "disease." Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software. "Westworld" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES. This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes). So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect. Even the bad guys seem familiar. Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer. They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl. Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree. The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner. A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development. I am normally opposed to remakes. For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films. The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake. But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original. The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life. As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive. For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs. The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects. The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle. My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum. All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film. It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation: JURASSAIC PARK. Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks. Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie. 
special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment. welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest. the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie 
A bit campy in spots, a bit ahead of its time in others, Westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy-happy Hollywood. Introduce an all-star cast at the beginning, split them up to the three different worlds, and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate... only to find themselves in Medieval World. Repeat formula for the second part, adding in the characters who went off to that park, then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at Roman World for the big third film finale. Seriously, why is somebody not making this already 
I watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night. She was into it (with her short attention span) for the whole film. One pleasant surprise...it has a pretty good chase scene. I like chase scenes. Any SF fan will welcome this in his/her collection. A few good comic shots. Watch Richard Benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the Jail break. 
I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!  
It was a great movie. If there were such a place as West World I would enjoy taking a vacation over there. I know I would have a great time. I am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real. It was a movie worth buying 
In the future, there is a special adult themepark called "Delos" which has three different area adventure worlds which are "Medieval World", "West World", and "Roman World" where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember. Two Vacationers ( Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) has chosen Westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot ( Yul Bryner) who wants to kill them. Amusing and fascinating Sci-fi thriller written and directed by the author of "Jurassic Park" Michael Crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it's time. Yul Bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on "The Terminator", this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre-Star Wars Sci-fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the Simpsons called "Itchy and Scratchy Land". The DVD has decent picture sound with only one extras which is the original trailer, but still this is a must have for anyone who likes Sci-fi. Also recommended: Jurassic Park, Terminator 1 2, Blade Runner, Tron, Robocop, I Robot, and Chopping Mall 
Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds star in this film centering on the heyday of the porn industry in the 70s and 80s. Mark Wahlberg stars as Eddie Adams, a [..]bus boy working at a nightclub washing dishes. One of the club's most frequent visitors is Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a porn movie producer who comes to the club looking for new actors. Rollergirl (Heather Graham) also works at the club and is one of Horner's most popular actresses. One night, Jack goes into the back to talk to Eddie and soon the two become friends. Jack tells Eddie all about the porn business, and Eddie is immediately intrigued. Eddie has nothing to lose, since his parents threw him out of the house with just the clothes on his back. Eddie accepts jack's invitation to act in one of his films and soon he is submurged in the world of [..] movies. His costar in his first movie is Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a very close friend of Jack's who lives in his house with him. Eddie has a very successful session with Amber, and soon he sees his career begin to skyrocket. Due to his new-found success, Eddie decides to change his name. He settles on Dirk Diggler. For several years, Dirk is living in the limelight, making lots of money, and filming lots of x-rated movies. However, success begins to take its toll, and Dirk delves into the world of drugs and alcohol. Dirk's hard-driving life catches up to him and he has a major falling-out with Jack, who has replaced him with a new main actor called Johnny Doe. Dirk's downward spiral continues, and he and his best friend Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly) are involved in a shoot-out with an over-drugged thug who likes to listen to Night Ranger music. Dirk survives, but he realizes his life is a mess. He decides to try to make amends with Jack, and Jack and Amber welcome him back with open arms. After their reconcilliation, Dirk resumes his role as Jack's main star. I thought this was a very good movie. Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds give fine performances. The plot is very good and does a good job of showcasing the porn industry at the height of its success. I recommend this movie very highly. Watch and get a feel for what it was like to be a porn star 
'Boogie Nights' does for the disco seventies and the porn industry what 'Nashville' did to country music. It shows the underside of the glamour presented. The film shows us all the trappings that draw people to the "high life," then pulls the rug out from under it. We see the usual suspects and the usual draws: There's money, fame, lust, passion, and drugs. But these benefits provide an understated banality that comes to the fore. The seemingly long, drawn out conversations are only postcards of emotion that show the depth of personhood that seems to escape all of the protagonists. It is superficial, and all of life's best elements seem to go out the window. There is the calculated cheesiness of the producer (Burt Reynolds) and his odd detatchment from his craft. He both revels and drowns in the lust and money that are presented to him. He meets a young aspiring hopeful (Mark Wallberg) who must overcome his poverty and alienation from home. His naivete' is striking, and he doesn't entirely change in his innocence, only becoming a casualty of it. (The way he practices to become the next Bruce Lee in the midst of his success as a novelty presentation is certainly a sad commentary about his life.) His new success doesn't make him all that happy, including his rationalization that his movies are making marriages more passionate. The aftermath of all the calculated lust makes everyone, except the calloused producer, a casualty in a different way. One fellow porn star (Don Cheadle) demonstrates that his true passion is for a loving marriage and a hi-fi business, but the decent, conventional world won't let him. Similarly, a fellow porn creator (William Macy) shows tragically that love transcends lust, even when it won't ever become realized. A female porn star is devastated by her cocaine addiction and an inevitable result of a custody battle. If we aren't convinced near the end of the movie, then a "candid camera" scene between "Rollergirl" and the man off the street certainly shows how the emotional baggage catches up to all of the porn industry's false promises for true happiness. The initial draw to 'Boogie Nights' may be deceptive. It presents the glamour of all that the modern world believes to be desirable, but cleverly shows how the lowest common denominator can restrict our lives from even greater happiness. 
This is a movie loosely based on 70's and 80's porn star John Holmes. In this version, a young man name Eddie Adams is approached by porn director Jack Horner. Eddie then turns famouse and leads into a downward spiral including drugs and violence. This movie features many stars of the late 90's and today, including Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams, Burt Reynolds at Jack Horner, John C. Reilly as Reid Rothchild, and Julianne Moore as Amber Waves. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore were nominated for oscars for their breakthrough performance. This movie was also nominated for Best Writing to Paul Thomas Anderson for an oscar. The Extras on this DVD are good: 10 Deleted Scenes, a Music Video, 2 Commentary tracks, and the John C. Reilly Files 
A film about the porn industry in the late 70's early 80's. Great Cast, Great Performances, Great Story, just a Great Film. Unique approach to the subject, characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion ,characters played by Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, and Burt Reynolds respectfully, are great to watch. This is a performance piece 
Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process. Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was. Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is as excessive and stylish as you'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry, with Anderson pulling out every trick in the book--long tracking shots, underwater closeups, montages, movie-within-a-movie views, and some moments that approach stream-of-consciousness (Dirk's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example). Naturally, Anderson also loads the movie up with period details, right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenage Dirk's room, the platform shoes, and the obligatory disco sequences. Its visual flair aside, though, Boogie Nights is also the sort of insanely quotable, watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties (Trainspotting, Fargo, Goodfellas, Swingers, True Romance, etc. etc. etc.) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade. This movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it, especially its murderer's row of a cast--Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner), Don Cheadle (Buck Swope), John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), William H. Macy (Little Bill), Luis Guzman (Maurice Rodriguez), Tom Jane (Todd Parker), Philip Baker Hall (Floyd Gondolli), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty Jay), and Alfred Molina (Rahad Jackson) all figure prominently--and even Wahlberg (Dirk himself) and Heather Graham (Rollergirl) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors. That said, what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters, who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like. The main characters almost entirely have hopes, aspirations, and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession--Jack's desire to be a serious filmmaker; Dirk's ridiculous pseudo-Karate and Reed's equally ridiculous poetry; Buck's goal of opening his own stereo store; Amber's attempts to get back in touch with her son, which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co-stars--helping us see them as fleshed-out characters, not just plot devices in the story. Since there isn't really a plot to speak of, the movie is told as a series of episodes, Goodfellas-style, with several extended pieces--the pool party at Jack's House where Eddie/Dirk gets introduced to the whole crew; the New Year's Eve party celebrating the start of the '80's; the fake drug deal gone bad at a Rahad's house--serving to turn the narrative in new directions. This last set piece--when Dirk, Reed, and Todd head over to Rahad's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt--deserves special mention, as it's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory. It starts off almost surreal, with a skinny Chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and Rahad (clad only in underwear, a bathrobe and slippers) discoursing semi-coherently as he sings along to not-so-classic 80's songs on a mixtape. From there it just gets progressively darker and tenser, with the lighting, acting, and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as Todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control. Molina's over-the-top performance, more than anything else, makes the scene, as he turns Rahad into a manic ball of drug-fuelled energy and, later, a shotgun-toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge. I wouldn't say Molina turns in the best performance I've ever seen in a movie, but it it probably the best performance I've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie. The '80's are, of course, the hangover from the joys of the previous decade, as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product, cocaine suddenly becomes addictive, and Dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one. Fittingly, as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties, the movie takes a darker turn, becoming grittier, more downcast and a lot more violent, but no less compelling. All the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present, just in a decidedly less sunny form. Even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right, the movie's pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away. Well, except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end, but by then I for one didn't care. 
The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes. Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft. Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed. Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much. At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package." This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters. This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie. Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing. There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.  One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg. He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt. Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered. Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women. That's simply not the case. In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity. The difficulty is that it's just plain boring. I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
Yes, my mock Amazon name is Dirk Diggler(long story), but this is "Boogie Nights". I can't say this movie was "over-looked", because it wasn't. In fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is, "Fan-f**k-ing-tastic". Burt Reynolds is back at the top of his game in years, Marky Mark can act(Dirk himself), Heather Graham, and all the rest are in top form. What can you say?? Kinda a mock story of John Holmes/70's/80's porn scene, but you really start to care about these people. Soundtrack represents the time and it all just works. I can't hear "Sister Christian" by Nightranger without thinking of that scene.(Some of you know, others will) Get the New Line 2 disc version. It's impressive. If you have an open mind and can take it for what it is, this will become a favorite, I guarentee it 
I was very impressed with this story. I saw it in the theater, and also have this version on DVD. This is one of the most intense, longest, fulfilling movies available on the topic of the pornography industry in the 70's and 80's. Very stylistic and (un)believable. A (c)ockumentary of superior proportions. But it wasn't really a documentary, just a Hollywood movie, based on a time, when porn was coveted by the raincoat crowd. When I say (un)believable, I mean the story truely is unbelievable, in that the porn industry is not a man actor's world, but clearly belongs to the female actor. She is the star in this industry. So, when I see a movie like this, I worry for the young men out there, who think that they are the next "Dirk Diggler." While, I'm probably over worrying the concept, I still hope that my words reach some man out there. This is not reality. This is a fantasy, conceptualized by a Hollywood Director; and nothing more. In reality, this could have easily been a story written about a female actress, such as Rollergirl? Interesting enough, the director fell into the cliche, making Rollergirl, a victim. Chastised by her Highschool classmates, and ran out of school. But in reality, we in the know, know that it is the Jenna Jameson's and Tera Patrick's who are the real starts. I give this one 5 stars though, as it really is an over the top effort by the director. I was quite impressed. Two hard ones up! This movie rocks! MC White said: Check it out!! 
one word INTERESTING and for the ending VERY INTERESTING... I was a bit iffy about this movie before i watch it but it was actually a good movie.. 
Boogie Nights is one of those films, in the vein of Blow, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Requiem for a Dream, that stares unflinchingly at something ugly and asks us to follow along without blinking. When it's the porn industry, it's hard not to blink. It's the swinging 70s, and porn is on the rise. Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), is a fresh-faced lad with a particular gift. That gift happens to be in his pants. His reputation is well known, but it's only when porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) discovers him that Dirk's career takes off. And thus begins a bizarre journey into the seedier side of filmmaking, complete with diva-level antics, arguments about video technology, and lots of sex and drugs. What's alternately curious and interesting about the film is that this is a traditional rag to riches story, only it happens to involve porn. Dirk is portrayed as having a natural talent, a trait every character observes with deadly seriousness. His talent, and the dedication to his "art," elevates the entire porn industry itself, from merely badly filmed shaky-cam sex films to dramas with plot and character development. Well, what passes for character development in porn, anyway. There's Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a porn queen barred from seeing her own children and subsequently mother to everybody. Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly) is Dirk's right-hand man and frequent co-star. Rollergirl (Heather Graham in her best acting role yet), does it with her roller skates on. All the time. Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) is a black porn star that wants to live the American dream of owning his own business. And finally, we have Little Bill (William H. Macy), assistant director to Horner and married to a utterly hedonistic woman who does it with everyone, everywhere, at any time. By the time we get to the 80s, several characters are dead, video is king, and Dirk is too hopped up on drugs to notice that it's affecting his performance. A falling out with Horner leads Dirk to strike out on his own, trying to be anything but a porn star. Unfortunately, Dirk's only good at one thing. And it takes him most of the movie to figure out what that is. Horner, Waves, and Dirk creates their own twisted, happy family. Incapable of living in society separately due to the stigma of what they do, they form a kinship that only they can share. And even they have their own bonds and boundaries; to their work, to themselves, to each other. Those that cannot define who they are end up dead or in prison, or worse. In the end, Boogie Nights is about making good with what you've got. And yes that means even porn stars sometimes have to face facts: sometimes you're best talent is having sex on camera. The question becomes what a 17-year-old kid turned porn star is supposed to do about it. Boogie Nights answers it in the final scene, when the true star of the film is unzipped to stare us in the face 
Well, there's nothing I can add to this spectacular DVD... Excellent concert that you shouldn't miss.. 
Upon my viewing of Zoo TV: Live in Sydney" at the tender age of ten, it is secure to articulate that I was most enamored with U2. Now being twenty-one years of age, this particular show still draws me. Despite having been previously stated before in aforementioned reviews, U2 are unquestionably at their best. That is not to declare that U2 attained their peak during the Zoo TV Tour, quite the contrary, for their tours succeeding have been and are just as extraordinary. After it was announced that Zoo TV should finally be released onto DVD, a U2 fan such as I could not facilitate but express delight and make purchase with all haste. I highly recommend this product. 
This title was actually one of the first DVDs announced for the DVD format back in 1997. If you can find an old copy of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" or other PolyGram DVDs of that era in their unique "slide-down" polycarbonate cases, you can see a brief preview of what this DVD was supposed to be. Unfortunately, PolyGram cancelled it shortly before it was supposed to be released, and it has been the Holy Grail of U2 fans for the past 9 years. Until it came out, the best format this was available on was CLV laserdisc, with none of the bonus stuff 
Simply put, 5 stars is NOT ENOUGH to describe this DVD. I will spare all the details, as they've pretty much been written already. Just go get this thing, now! 
Great concert i remember this tour ,for me is the best tour because u2 visit the first time my country,Mexico 
The 90's Quadrilogy of Achtung Baby,Zooropa,The Passengers(released under that psuedonym)and Pop are the last daring albums of U2's career. This concert footage parodies not only U2's celebrity, but celebrity in general. With banks and banks of television moniters decorating the stage, the band was mocking it's own ubiquity. Sadly, they have now become everything they were making fun of on this tour 
Finally we get zoo TV on DVD great stuff great looking back on this tour brought back memories, I think bono sounds pitchy and off key in most of this DVD not his best vocals by far ,but otherwise a great concert 
Well, finally we've reached the end of the "yellow brick road" and have ourselves a great DVD release with this AWESOME concert out of Oz, Nov 1993. I love how this band still gives the fans what they want (check that: NEED lol) and release great great great DVD's of their live shows! I mean, I am a Prince fan also (not as much as I was was I was 14)and that guy has BARELY let out any of his spectacular concert shows!("Syracuse '85", "Sign O' the Times", "Rave 2000", and now "Alladin Live"---that's it??) out on VHS or DVD. "Alladin" "Rave" were the ONLY DVD releases, well officially anyways. U2 could and would put out a LIVE anthology boxed set - 1979-2006 if they wanted to and it would not have to be culled from any of their already released live DVD/VHS releases(ie "Zoomerang Sydney", "POPMART Mexico City" etc)I mean the MIND BOGGLES at the possibilities! But what has come out has been quality AND quantity! I mean they put out the fabulous "Chicago 2005" show last year (SAME year it was recorded -in MAY!) and there is talk of ANOTHER "Vertigo Tour" DVD (forgot what show -I wanna say another Mexico City) this year too! I mean we U2 fans have it too damn good! I know a forthcoming "Popmart" DVD release is due probably next year. And like this DVD they will put out a great transfer with fun bonus material and really capture the "era" it represented. "ZOO TV" and "POPMART" are both my two favorite tours, even though I never got myself to a U2 concert until November 2001 and THAT was a transcendent experience! Same with "Vertigo in Nov 2005", but that show was not to the high standard left by the big stadium tours. These guys still deliver. Wait and be patient for "Red Rocks 1983" too it will come out soon I think! And when it does, expect the same love and care given out by the men from U2!!! 
Incredible ! Zoo TV , 12 years on and still holding up strong...IMHO Achtung Baby / Zoo TV was as revolutionary, groundbreaking and mezmerizing to 90s Rock as The Beatle's Sgt. Pepper was in the 60's. Get this DVD. 
Live from Sydney is the first DVD release to actually take place long before the others. Done around the Achtung Baby/Zooropa era, the DVD is missing a lot of those songs from Pop to All That You Can't Leave Behind and Atomic Bomb. For some it's great (I mean, how often can we see Beautiful Day and Elevation on a DVD?) while others wish that certain songs were included or that the concert took place after a certain record. Zoo TV was just the precursor to the band's too-ambitious PopMart tour yet at the same time it's great to see that spectacle aspect. As usual with a U2 DVD, the set tends to be chockful of whatever album they were promoting. Not that Achtung Baby is a bad album, in fact it's my top U2 album trumping the usual de-facto best album Joshua Tree. Only thing is though is that the set seems to be one Achtung Baby track after another. Great to see Even Better than the Real Thing while I wish Wild Horses was on. However, we get some great moments including a great Unchained Melody rendition, Lemon on DVD finally as well as Love is Blindness. One disappointment is that there's no All I Want is You, Heartland, I Still Haven't Found..., Bad, and damnit, put Gloria for a change on the set. Of course anyone can go through an entire U2 DVD and whine about what they missed or what they haven't written yet such as Discotheque and Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me. Where the show does shine though is there's a true grandiose fashion to it all. From car floodlights to a big remote control checking out soccer games to Bono calling for a cab, it's a far cry from the relatively straightforward DVD's of recent. While it is missing a bit of those charismatic moments such as the Boston DVD where he lay beside a girl on the stage or Slane Castle where he was practically in tears during Kite but during Love is Blindness he actually held onto a fan for almost the entire song...in Macphisto makeup. While it doesn't have the power of Boston or intimacy of Slane Castle, it's nonetheless a great portrait of rockers who were very daring and showmen at one point 
FIRST OFF: "The Man in the Moon", is a great film! With Robert Mulligan, the director of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and 'The Summer of 42' at the helm, and a 14 year old Reese Witherspoon as Dani, who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time, the film certainly starts out on the right foot. IN A NUTSHELL: A TALE OF 2 SISTERS [some plot spoilers below] Its roughly the summer of 1957 in rural Louisiana. Maureen Trant, 17, [Emily Warfield] and Dani Trant, 14, [Reese Witherspoon] are sisters. Very close bonds hold them together, but this summer will put a strain on their relationship. The strain comes in the form of Mr. Right appearing without warning as the boy next store. His name is Court Foster [Jason London] and he is 17 years old. The trouble is, Dani saw him first, or more correctly he saw her. The family knows that Dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy, but owing to the age differences and the boy's character nobody is worried -- except Court. He's got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around -- and perhaps more -- too much more?! THEN THE PLOT THICKENS: [more plot spoilers below] Maureen never sees Court until we're about halfway through the summer, since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the Trants. When she does see him, he has come to their house to visit Dani, but then something happens. Court and Maureen are obviously taken with each other and Dani can't believe it. How could her sister betray her like this? From this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when Mr. Right appears to both of them as the perfect man. Robert Mulligan - Director Sam Waterston - Matthew Trant Tess Harper - Abigail Trant Gail Strickland - Marie Foster Reese Witherspoon - Dani Trant Jason London - Court Foster Emily Warfield - Maureen Trant Bentley Mitchum - Billy Saunders ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFER SPECIAL FEATURES: THEATRICAL TRAILER SCENE SELECTIONS - WISH THERE WERE MORE BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A 'REEL' SLICE OF LIFE THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT This is quite a little story with a big punch. The supporting roles are impeccably played with Sam Waterston playing Matthew Trant, the father, and Tess Harper playing Abigail Trant, as the mother. They have their own personal dramatic subplot in this summer of 57 in Louisiana. 
I loved the setting of this movie; it was out in the country with peaceful nature sounds I enjoy hearing. The pace was relaxed but not dull at all. The plot was sweet, the acting well done. Reese Witherspoon demonstrated her talent in this movie, her first major role. 
I LOVED this movie. Breathtaking scenery, a simple yet enthralling story, and wonderful acting all around. No drugs, no guns, no over-the-top violence. A nice movie to watch on a rainy day.... 
I love this little story of the relationship between two sisters. The performances are heartfelt and the score is haunting. It still gets me : 
I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a now rarely seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland) moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind. The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time. A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message 
I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on (it's been some time now) and I plan to buy it. Waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father. I didn't realize when I first saw it that Reese Witherspoon was the daughter (that was before Reese Witherspoon became Reese Witherspoon). A heartbreaking, beautifully acted and must-see film. Rings true to life. They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, and it's a shame 
This is a masterpiece of cinema. After watching Robert Mulligan's more famous (to me) movies: To Kill a Mockingbird and Summer of '42, I found this jewel. I did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is. Directors like Ford, Hawks, Lubitsch or Vidor and Capra are long gone, and so is cinema as art, but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it, although it may only last a blink of an eye. I am off to check out "Come September" now. Who is this Robert Mulligan, anyway? Lovable little gem 
Excellent movie. Seriously, why can't they make more movies like this? Smart, well-acted, very dramatic, exciting. I could go on and on. Just a very satisfying movie....each of the thousand times I have watched it. If I accidently come across it on TNT or HBO or wherever, I have to sit and watch it until the end even though I have it on DVD right there on my bookshelf! I can't walk away! I love the beginning of the movie when they are boarding the sub, and they are standing in the rain while Hackman addresses the crew, and he has that little Q routine with the chief of the boat (George Dzundza). This scene really sets the tone. It almost made me want to join the Navy. The battle between Hackman and Washington's characters is, of course, what the movie is all about, and they pull it off flawlessly. Very good work by both men. That said, all of the key charactors are interesting and well-acted. The director really pulls this movie together very well despite the many charactors involved (many of these guys are big stars now). The great acting, the very exciting story, and edge of the seat drama just overwhelm whatever weaknesses or improbabilities that may exist in this movie. Great stuff. 
This is a simply amazing movie, and what makes it even more stellar is that we've had several fantastic submarine movies in the past - Das Boot and Red October come to mind. We've already seen the claustrophobic, booming power of being trapped in an underwater submarine. That this movie is able to make that closeness even more powerful - and draw us into a story that really grips you with its meaning - is rather impressive. We begin with two powerhouses of actors, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. Gene is in charge of the sub; Denzel works for him. Gene is an unabashed alpha male, not unheard of in a commander. Denzel is intelligent and respects the chain of command. Suddenly, we're thrown into a situation where the sub *might* have been ordered to launch a missile attack on an enemy to protect the US. Unfortunately, the sub can't get confirmation. So either they shoot and risk starting WWIII for no reason - or they fail to shoot and leave millions of people open to slaughter. The plot and dialogue is incredible because it explores all the shades of grey in the characters. There's no right or wrong. Both scenarios are equally plausible. Gene wants to do what he was ordered to do, to save as many lives as he can. Denzel is desperate to get confirmation rather than risk mistakenly starting a world war. Both men suck up the men around them into their sides. Nobody WANTS the war. Gene doesn't take pleasure in firing - but he sees it as a necessary action to save lives. In such close confines, every person on screen makes a huge difference. This movie had not only two stellar top men, but also a fantastic supporting cast. James Gandolfini a la Sopranos. Viggo Mortensen a la Lord of the Rings. The music from Hans Zimmer is just amazing. He is a genius and can give incredibly subtle nuances to his works. If I had to find something to nit-pick in this movie, it's that I don't think the sub scenes were truly "realistic". It seemed more of a Hollywood sub than a real working piece of machinery that trained soldiers were living in for months. I think Das Boot did an exquisite job of getting that sense across. But really, the sub in this case was a "set" for the dialogue and character development to happen in. It wasn't the showcase, and this wasn't a sub documentary. So I'm willing to accept that tradeoff, so that we could have as tightly woven a story as we got. 
The very best war movies resonate with viewers not just because of top flight acting but because there is always a subtext present that demands that viewers think as well as view. In CRIMSON TIDE, director Tony Scott allows the events on the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine, to force viewers to confront some truly ugly but inevitable revelations: that in some dicey situations there are no good versus bad guys, just decent men who demand that events follow their own unique perceptions of those events. Gene Hackman is Captain Ramsey, a tough nuclear sub skipper who has just received an order to launch his sub's missles at Russia, which has just discovered that one of its military bases has been taken over by a rogue general who is determined to launch his missles at America. Just after Ramsey receives his order to launch, the needed verfication to launch does not arrive due to an unexpected underwater confrontation with a Russian sub. The Alabama's radio is damaged. Should Ramsey launch anyway on the premise that to delay can lead only to the certainty that the Russians will get the first blow in? His XO, Lieutenant Commander Turner (Denzel Washington) does not think so. Both believe that the other is totally wrong. Turner leads a mutiny to prevent the launch. CRIMSON TIDE is a claustrophobic testosterone filled plunge into the icy waters of duty versus rationality. Hackman injects his role with the total believability of ruthlessness that has come to mark his essential film persona. He can slug Washington in the face in one scene to enforce his decision to launch. Then in the very next scene can placidly discuss horse breeding with the same man with the same believability. CRIMSON TIDE is a film of men under stress with some handling it better than others. George Dzundza has a powerful supporting role as the head of security who is forced by circumstances to back Washington, whom he believes to be in the right over Ramsey, a captain whom he greatly respects but believes to be in the wrong. When Ramsey regains control, Dzundza grudgingly admits, "Half of me is glad that he did." And that right there is the compelling subtext of the movie: that events force both actor and viewer to decide whether unfolding events ought to fill us with fear that one or the other side may be in the Right--but never knowing which is which. CRIMSON TIDE is a terrific film that requires the viewer to face such a choice whether he wants to or not 
OH YA FORGET NAVY SUBS WELL THE RUSSIAN MILITARY IS BETTER AND RUSSIAN ARMY BETTER THEY CAN BEAT USA 
This movie was good, though there were many innacuracies as to what really goes on inside a nuclear sub. That aside it is very good 
I GIVE THE DVD A 1 STAR NOT THE MOVIE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW DISC SET COMING OUT. Finally this morning, Disney has delayed the DVD release of the Crimson Tide: Unrated Extended Edition from 3/14 to 5/16. No word as to why 
When this movie came out in 1995, I caught it in the theatre and enjoyed it so much, I bought the Video Tape (and just to let you know - The Hunt for Red October, Video Tape, also!). But I digress. Gang, it appears that a "Unrated" version of "Crimson Tide" is coming out on DVD. "Unrated??" What could they possible put on the DVD to make it unrated? The scheduled release date is 03/14/2006. IF I can equate "Unrated Version = Special Edition," then I'm in for my copy! Great movie - Four Stars!! 
I watched the film in the theater when it came out, was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies. Trying to "entertain"/ educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best. The Pet Dog was cute but also unrealistic. The book "The Gold Crew" had a more believable plot. Having served on a few Ballistic Missile Submarines, I find it an insult to the Crews of the Boats Especially to the Captains and officers. It's Understandable why the Navy Refused to Bless this. By placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen, which it couldn't as depicted. Too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it. From November 15, 1960-May 25, 2001. The Navy completed 3500 Deterrent Patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch. And there Still out there boring holes in the water 
Take a solid script about nuclear warfare, puff it up with Quentin Tarantino style, cram it all into a submarine called the U.S.S. Alabama, throw in the legendary Gene Hackman and future legend Denzel Washington and what do you get? "Crimson Tide." One of the best military flicks I've ever seen. Chock full of emotion, intensity and suspense, "Crimson Tide" takes the viewer on a whirlwind tour of life, death, and warfare on a nuclear Naval submarine. Hackman is the captain of the Alabama, a sub destined to launch nuclear missiles on Russia in a last ditch attempt to suppress rebel forces in that country. Denzel Washington is the handpicked XO that is forced to make a terrible decision. During an undersea battle with rebel forces, an emergency message is lost during transmission. Was the message sent to stop plans to fire the nuclear missiles or to go ahead with the plans? Hackman insists he go ahead with his original orders to launch the nukes. Washington stands against him and has the captain sent to his quarters. All of this is done by the book. What results is a mutiny by the captain in an attempt to regain control of his sub and continue his original mission. Full of intense sequences involving life and death situations, this film left me exhausted by the constant decisions made and the timing of each event. Hackman and Washington were superb in their roles. Each conveyed the emotion and allegiance of their respective characters flawlessly. But the list of excellent actors doesn't stop there. Viggo Mortensen, of "Lord of the Rings" and "Hidalgo" fame, plays Webster. He's Washington's friend and a loyal officer on the ship who literally holds the fate of the world in his hands. Steve Zahn ("Saving Silverman," "Daddy Daycare," "Happy, Texas") is solid in a supporting role. Former child star Rick Schroder also appears in a brief but moving role. Danny Nucci ("Titanic") plays an officer who stands for what he believes is right. James Gandolfini ("The Sopranos") is also here in a wonderfully sinister role as Hackman's loyal shipmate. Oh, and don't forget to throw in Ryan Phillipe ("I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Cruel Intentions"), who has a miniscule role but does well none the less. There are other faces in the crowd who haven't achieved as much fame, but you'll recognize them from smaller roles in other films. For instance, George Dzundza, who's been in a ton of films but never a star and Scott Grimes, who I only knew was in this film when I saw the credits role. You may recognize Grimes' name from "Critters." In short, this motion picture has a very capable cast of well-known performers, future stars, and minor players who fill out the plot exceptionally well. Highly recommended to fans of claustrophobic cinema such as "The Hunt For Red October" and naval stories in general. Also, fans of intense drama will definitely enjoy this film 
Three jocular guys get on stage and do a lampoon homage to the classics, while breaking down the fourth wall like a wrecking ball. The Beastie Boys? Nope, it's the Reduced Shakespeare Company. They break character, break the play, argue about the direction of the play (like kids in a pick-up game), toss good-natured insults, and interact with/razz the audience. They even do a long spoof on pretentious acting workshops, as they prepare a dragged up audience member to say her line (actually, she just has to scream -- but it's a good one with subtext! :-) Throughout the show, the trio's "what next" anarchy is more entertaining than their condensed versions of plays. For Bard vets, this disc may re-contextualize your ideas about the plays. For kids and beginners, it may inspire. (It's obvious that the Reduced players mastered Shakespeare before they broke it down). For people who read prescribed Shakespeare as a chore, with MTV on... and never looked back (like me)... the show's anarchy/"lack of respect" will entertain. In short, the Reduced posse has something for everyone. It may even be better than reading Macbeth Cliffs notes with the Beastie Boys cranked up to 11.... Maybe.... "If you, wanna know, the real deal about the three, well let me tell you we're triple trouble, y'all, we're gonna bring you up to speed -- check it out!" (Beastie Boys). Get your learn on 
There are a few moments in the play that thankfully my younger children didn't seem to get, but I wouldn't have missed their acting it out afterwards for all the money in the world! One reviewer wrote that it helps to have a knowledge of Shakespeare before watching, and I agree to an extent. That does make it funnier when they combine the titles of the comedies, however I also feel that someone unfamiliar will want to become familiar after watching this group play with the material so easily. Fantastic and refreshing! 
And yes, while it is helpful to know your Shakespeare (*ahem* Team Francis Bacon), it is not necessary to have more than a passing recollection of the tediousness of it that was foisted off onto you in high school, to find this comedy troupe a laugh riot. With all the $100 million+ budget drivel coming out of Hollywood in the last decade, it was really nice just to be able to sit back and enjoy something chock full of talent and mirth. 
This is a hilarious play, taped for TV viewing. I have seen the original and on second viewing it was equally funny. While it MAY help to know some Shakespeare, there is so much slapstick and other humour that the whole family will laugh 
This is one of the funniest DVDs I have ever seen! You can watch it over and over again and its still just as funny. Definately a must for any video collection 
This show, on stage or on DVD, never ceases to amaze me. I enjoyed watching it and it never gets old. some slight understanding of shakespeare helps to understand the humor, but overall i thought it was awesome. definitely worth the money 
These guys are terrific! I'm a student of Shakespeare, so every time I read a play I haven't read before I pull out this DVD to see what they've done to it! After reading Coriolanus I was rolling on the floor with their comments on how this play wasn't appropriate for children. If you love Shakespeare, or are just curious about Shakespeare, buy this DVD 
Jeeezeee.......... It was a good break from the normal junk that get's put out... These guys are genuinly funny and it shows on stage.... PURCHASE IF YOU WANT A GOOD LAUGH.... You don't even have to understand a word or a line or know anything about Shakespeare to enjoy this!! 
This movie is still as good today as it has always been. I had the original on VHS, but decided to get the DVD because I don't have a video machine any more. The only problem I have is that I was hoping for subtitles because the accent is a bit thick in places and I can't make out what they are saying. I checked the spec and Amazon says the DVD had subtitles. But when I played the movie it said there was were no subtitles. Besides that, no other issues with the DVD. 
Scott Neal and Glen Berry team up in this British film of two gay adolesents coming to terms with their sexuality and the pitfalls it entails. I don't know of a more tender, sweet love story between two young males than "BEAUTIFUL THING". The title says it all. In the face of a cruel world, predjudice society, and family struggles, these two lads find something beautiful and unique, through each other, that they never knew could possibly exist. This is the perfect companion video to "GET REAL". Very tastefully done with superb acting talent and a good supporting cast. If you like gay romance, and coming of age films, this one will surely go down as one your very favorites of all time 
I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship. The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene. Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie 
I did enjoy this film - it had animated characters - gay sexual tensions - a bit of drama - and a heartwarming ending - 4 stars - You know the story Gay Boy (Jamie) falls for the Hot Boy Next Door (Ste). Is he Gay? Is he Straight? Find out in this loving film about your average nutty neighbors all trying to coexist. Plus this film features a scene that had me holding my breath - Jamie makes the first move, a very tense moment in any young mans life! 
Movies, plays, and books are all subjective endeavors. The idea is to suspend your disbelief while reading or watching the piece. In the case of BEAUTIFUL THING, that is not hard to do. From the opening frame you want Jamey to thrive. He hates PE because the macho guys pick on him as they start a game of soccer (the English call it football). He jumps the fence and heads home skipping PE for the umpteenth time. Who can blame him and when a school chum's, Ste's, homelife with his brother and father takes an abusive turn, Jamey's mother rescues him on those nights and the two teens form a bond that goes well beyond friendship. As the two guys struggle to deal with their love and erotic feelings for each other, the music of Mama Cass Elliott plays in the background. The story and the music is an enchanting combination that intensifies your urge to see them make it as a couple. You know they are young but not too young. You wish that had happened to you when you were their age. Earlier reviews have already mentioned the terrific supporting cast as well as the two leads in this story, so I won't go into that here. Instead, I want you to see the DVD so you can experience the feeling I felt at the end of the movie when Jamey and Ste begin a slow dance in the street in full view of their neighbors. Unlike a few of my friends who dismissed this scene as unrealistic in a poor working class neighborhood, I chose to suspend my disbelief and each time I watch it, I mouth the word "yes". 
I have talked it over with a few of my friends, and I have come to feel that there are certain films that are among the most important in Queer cinema for any generation. For Gen-X, the film I would have to call THE important Queer cinema film would be Beautiful Thing 
A wonderful story about you young men that fall in love, once you see it you want to own it, and i did, so i bought it. ive seen it 4 times and will watch it many times more 
I find this film very interesting, though not for the reasons you would expect. It's about two male teenagers living in a working class neighborhood in London, who one day discover they are attracted to each other. One of them is not even aware that he might be gay (Ste, the popular athlete). Put in this way, it may sound like your typical coming of age gay story. But it is much more than that. And what makes this movie really special is the supporting cast. They carry the weight of the story. The character played by Linda Henry (Sandra, Jamie's mother) is truly fascinating, and her performance is astounding. And Leah deserves a film just for herself. Also the soundtrack by Mama Cas and the Mamas Papas is a standout. I think that both gay and straight audiences will enjoy this excellent film 
This is a charming flick about two teenage boys who discover their love for one another after harrowing circumstances land them in the same apartment and eventually in the same bed 
Fortunitely, way back when, I got a hold of a vinyl album that spotlighted various tracks of comedic highlights from this show. Fortunitely this show plays on cable like "I Love Lucy". The opening duet and final piano play were both included on the vinyl album in entirety. The show had many moments that could make the most solemn creature belt a good one because the situations were anything but goody-goody. They were newsworthy from pregnancy, abortion, homosexuality, atheism, religion, politics, and of course, bigotry. I read one article, back when the show first premiered, that a woman called her son long distance to make him tune in to "All In The Family" so he could see how his deceased father was. 
It's amazing to watch this television series and realize we live in an age where people seem to believe everything goes (like same sex marriages, freedom of just about everything including behavior) yet many of the topics addressed with humor in this show are completely taboo on the regular channels. It was funny during the 70's, and it's still funny today 
Some classic episodes indeed. All In The Family broke new ground in television sitcoms. The world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households. Archie Bunker's old fashioned values were being challenged. It is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced Archie Bunker's views were. Organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood? Not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion? Quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone. Certainly a great show that makes you think about differing points of view and how we have evolved since the 1970's. Carol O'Connor, Jean Stapelton, Sally Struthers, and Rob Reiner portray a slice of pie in ever changing times. All In The Family spawned off may other great shows such as The Jeffersons, Maude, and indirectly Good Times. This first season was certainly a reverred one. Just look at it with an open mind 
IF A COMPANY WANTS ME TO WRITE A REVIEW IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR SALES, THEY SHOULD PAY ME 
This T.V show rates as one of my favorites of all time. In the genre of comedy it is my favorite show to date. One of the great things about All In The Family was its ability to take the viewer on a slice of life journey through the comedic irony and sometimes painful reality of life. In my humble opinion Carroll O'Conner and Jean Stapleton were and are two of the greatest acting talents ever. This DVD collection is very well done. I highly recommend it to all. 
An excellent rendition of the show I saw on television. I got to see the episodes I had missed 
Archie Bunker is the funniest sitcom character in television history. I own all five seasons and am eagerly awaiting the sixth. Of course, like most sitcoms, the humor of the first season does not have quite as much punch as the rest of them. But, I DID about split my side on the very last episode of this season, especially where Archie says...(see review title) 
As usual, Archie has his crazy ideas of how the world works, the races work, women work, and everything else that he's made up or gathered from his brain or bigoted friends. I love every minute of it! I think I enjoy this show because if you look past the obvious, you will learn a lesson. Episodes like "Judging Books By Covers" explains that it's not always the most obvious that are homosexual...and just like anybody else, they are people too, so get over it. In "Lionel Moves Into the Neighborhood," it is more than obvious that Lionel has been coming into Archie's home for years, but suddenly when a black family moves into the neighborhood, Archie realizes that he may have to bend more of his "rules". I am crazy about Lionel's tactics in dealing with Archie...and how Archie can't seem to realize that Lionel is making fun of him ALL THE TIME. "The First and Last Supper" was entertaining because this is when George Jefferson gets to show that he is just as bad as Archie by not showing up to dinner. This was a brave show to put on television, not because it showed a racist view. We have plenty of those type of shows today. But because "All in the Family" makes fun of prejudice, racism, and sexism in a way that no show has done since. 
'Amazon reviewers' have already pointed out the dramatic change this show brought to sit- com TV. They have also indicated the specific episodes included here. They have said something about Archie and dingbat Edith, Meatball and little sweet Gloria. My only addition is to point out how much pleasure this show brought to my own parents, of blessed memory. It was waited for and anticipated each week. 
Perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done. Mr. Maxwell's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable. Mr. Shaara's novel provided a great resource and Mr. Maxwell gave the visual display its magic. The depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves. Mr. Duvall gave a performance expected of his talents. Mr. Lang provided the quintessential "Stonewall" in all his intense humanity and passion in faith. For the lover of history, the detail is exceptional. It may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time, this is the film where you can. Admirers of "Stonewall" will especially appreciate this film. Those unfamiliar with "Stonewall" will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man. His intensity still shines forth more than a century later. It is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end. In addition, the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb. I had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and I am very pleased with the result that has survived in this DVD edition. It was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with Stonewall. 
It's amazing how Hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to Secession mythology, from Birth of a Nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification. This is a very dull, shapeless, stilted movie. I wouldn't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds, but since it is above all a piece of propaganda, I'm compelled to condemn it as history. What it presents is the "War between the States" version of the Civil War, in which the gallant Southerners defend their homes,their beloved hills and dales, their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the North. There are only two Black characters, both sentimentally loyal to their Southernness and their masters; otherwise, slavery is beside the point. The generalship of Lee and Jackson, of course, is idolized, while the Northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools. The battle scenes are perfectly predictable; guys charge on foot, other guys shoot, the fields are littered with bodies. Wouldn't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting? How real is it to show only one train, and that Southern, in a war won more by transportation than by musketry? If you are a believer in the myth of the Lost Cause and the justice of Secession, if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the War wasn't really about slavery, then I challenge you honor! I defy you to read just one heavy, scholarly book, Arguing About Slavery by William Lee Miller, a professor at the University of Virginia. It retells the debates that occurred in the House of Representatives, over slavery, in the 1830s, twenty-five years before the election of Lincoln. The uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the Civil War had deeper roots than you thought, and that slavery Was indeed the central issue for both sides, Blue and Grey 
An almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film's narrative, as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches Though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers, it is a dramatic technique at least as old as Homer's ILIAD and ODYSSEY. What GODS AND GENERALS shares with those ancient poetic balads is the celebration of the fighting man's nobility, his rage, and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine. GODS AND GENERALS sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout, the director's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers. This nation's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved. It was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually. The events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could. True, Lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union's preservation, but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place. The film follows the trajectory of General Lee and - more prominently - Virginia's 'Stonewall' Jackson. The latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led, not of himself. But his grateful men would have it no other way. 'Stonewall Jackson' he would be from Manassas on, and 'Stonewall' he would die. Robert Duvall, Stephen Lang, and Jeff Daniels do their characters proud, though it is perhaps Duvall's General Lee who most rings true to the man's decency, calm, and painful array of allegiances. Mira Sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the Maine Lieutenant Coronel Chamberlain's wife, Mrs. Fanny Chamberlain. 'War', one of the characters is early heard to say, 'is the sum of all evils' and its reputed provocation by Mr. Lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake'. The achievement of GODS AND GENERALS is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men, who at times find fratricide thrust upon them, carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves. This film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the American republic, a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates, staining its streets, and drowning numbers of its finest 
It is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time. This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame. It was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson. Jackson was considered, even by his contemporaries, a military genius but crazy by half. The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty. Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean. The prayer scene in the morning? PUKE! It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching, or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene. Most of the "women" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded, and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her. Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor. I get it Jackson was "such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual" give me a break, I hate being force feed like that. A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly. Then there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares. There is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film. I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been. A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige. If you must see it borrow it, rent it, but don't waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart. Gettysburg is much better. I actually missed Sheen and I hate that guy 
Great movie, great actors for such a sad part of the U.S. history ! It is great to see in this movie some men who really existed (especially "Stonewall" Jackson). We don't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction, but at the end of the day it's not very important, because the historical interest is preserved 
I'm not a Civil War expert, but having recently visited Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, I paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books I read. When I came home I watched both Gettysburg and Gods and Generals again, and I must say, the events of these important battles come to life in these DVDs. Yes, there's always going to be some interpretation done, but overall I thought the acting was well done and the information reliable. The characters were well developed, as I felt that I got a chance to really know what these men were like. If you want to see history, then I would recommend this and Gettysburg as well 
When I got this DVD it was like I was there at the concert. The sound is so good. The band did an excelent job 
REO still rocks and this concert proves that Rock and Roll is still alive with this power performance! The band still has the youthful hunger of the early years! Lead Kevin Cronin's voice still sounds great singing favorites like:"Time for me to fly," "Don't let him go," "Take it on the run," "Keep on loving you," "Can't fight this feeling anymore," "and so many others!! I love the lead guitar in REO Dave Amato!! Awesome lead guitar gives REO a great edge! I've seen REO this summer in concert recently and saw how the audience, including me, just gravitated to the front of the stage and rocked the night away! We all knew the songs and the place became a communal atmosphere that just doesn't happen anymore with music. Luckily I happened to reach up and catch one of Kevin Cronin's guitar picks which now has a framed presentation in my bedroom. It was fun! REO has brought back a better time for music and with this concert dvd, I can relive it over and over. Don't forget the special features which are interviews with Kevin Cronin and Neal Doughty. Love it and you will too 
If you are from that Deep Purple ,Foreigner ,Rainbow ,Whitesnake,Bad Company... era,just go ahead and grab this one .Good Sound ,Picture and The band sounds really tight 
"Plus" was brilliantly shot before an packed enthusiastic crowd in Kansas City, and shows the 5 guys of the current REO and how awesome performance musicians they are. Contains the same show on the Arch Allies CD with Styx, but this is REO on their own and That Ain't Love, Keep Pushin, and Tough Guys were added. They can't stop rockin, in fact they sound tighter live than many bands sound in the studio. It also contains interviews with Kevin and Neal (on the DVD they are separate from the performance), and the DVD also contains 5.1 Dolby sound, and a trivia game fun and challenging for even longtime fans. Highly recommended whether or not you've worn out your copy of the Wheels are Tourin video :- 
A great film with an engrossing story- I literally could not take my eyes off it.George Peppard's signature role (better than Tiffany's). If you long for a movie with a great story buy it! Congrats to Paramount for the excellent transfer- sharp with great colours and very little evidence of print damage 
I've been a fan of this version of the movie for years. I love the theme music, and the storyline. George Pappard is wonderful also. Definitely dated, a lot of sexist stuff, pre women's lib 
I'm a huge fan of the harold robbins novel but i've got to say that the film is every bit as good and probably better. The only thing lacking id the back story about nevada smith but he has his own film as well so i recommend getting that one also. overall its a terrific story and in a day and age when its all about special effects this film stands alone as a story, and a bloody good one at that 
"The Carpetbaggers" is a fantastic adaptation of Harold Robbins' bestseller, very racy for its era, with dialogue that is often rare and juicy, a superb cast, and great direction by Edward Dmyrtryk. The character of Jonas Cord is loosely based on the life of Howard Hughes, and it is interesting to compare this film with Martin Scorsese's "The Aviator." Both George Peppard as Cord and Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes give brilliant performances, but overall, I find this film far more satisfying, and certainly a lot more entertaining. Peppard was at the height of his career in this film, and it is perhaps his best. It gives him a wide range of emotions, as well as the physicality and toughness he was so good at. Others that shine in the large cast are Alan Ladd in what was to be his last film as Nevada Smith, Carroll Baker as the sultry Rina, Robert Cummings as Nevada's slick and slimey manager. Elizabeth Ashely as Mrs. Jonas Cord (and who soon after this film was to become the real life Mrs. Peppard), Martin Balsam as the owner of a film studio, and Lew Ayres, as second in command in Jonas Cord's empire, has some of the best lines in the film. The pacing of the film never lags, and there is a brutal fight between Jonas and Nevada, one of those screen fights that is always fascinating to watch. The Nevada Smith character is quite complex, and was to spawn a "prequel" 2 years later, starring Steve McQueen. The cinematography by Joseph MacDonald is marvelous, the Edith Head gowns lavishly glamorous, and very important to the success of this film is the fabulous jazzy score, which is one of Elmer Bernstein's finest. In my youth I devoured all of Robbins' books, loved the well-written sleaze of them, and loved this film in its theatrical release. I've since watched it repeatedly, and find more to enjoy in it with each viewing. Total running time is 150 minutes. 
I just got through watching this Dmytryk film on TCM tonight, and all I can say is that if you are looking for the George Peppard who played Paul Varjak in Breakfast at Tiffany's, forget it. In fact, he is so cold and so stiff (I realize he's trying to play a nasty Howard Hughes knockoff), that a cardboard figurine would have been just as convincing in his stead. Outside of great costumes and sets, this movie is long and boring. Where it's not boring it's a snicker inducing raunchfest. Poor Alan Ladd in his final role, barely having to act as he plays a drunken hasbeen, and Elizabeth Ashley who is the only redeeming character in the entire plot and also resembles Audrey Hepburn to a scary degree in the last half of this debacle. Carroll Baker may be sexy in her lingerie, but she's so over-the-top with her heavy breathing and her lingerie that you actually want to cheer when her car goes off the road. I can think of better ways to pass my time for 2 and 1/2 hours than this...like watching the mating rituals of moth-eaten underwear. Still, you just can't stop watching it through to its unrealistic ending. If I'd have thought beating up one of my old flames after years of his acting like a total jag would have changed him overnight, I'd have done it long ago! If you must see this lousy piece of 60's smut, make sure you rent it or come across it on TV before you go buying it. I've seen corpses that are more convincing than Peppard was in this flick! 
This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish. It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp. Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot. George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on "The A-Team". Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture. It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill. Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy. The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular). If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow 
I just finished watching the "The Carpetbaggers" on AMC; I thought the 'C' part of that acronym was "Classic", but now realize that perhaps 'Cornball,' 'Contagious,' or 'Compelling' may substitute since this movie seemed to be all of this. But, hey, maybe that's just the gin talkin. It is one of those movies that you cannot wait to end, so you can find out just who these B-film actresses really were - yet you continue to watch. But when it does end, you are somewhat saddened that it is over. Partially sad because you have been drawn in by this charismatic yet utterly ruthless SOB Jason Cord (George Peppard), but mostly just sad because AMC DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE CREDITS! that's why I'm here...finding out that the actresses were Caroll baker (as Rina Marlowe, the not-so-lovable Hollywood star; and Elizabeth Ashley (as Monica Cord) - the impossibly forgiving ex/not-so-happily-ever-after-wife of the unmarriable-unlovable-unrelenting-insanely ambitious Jason. Bob Cummings gets accolades as the fiendishly charming scumbag who plays Dan Pierce - most probably a very typical Hollywood agent. Someone who would put a rattlesnake in your pocket and then ask you for a match if he could get 10% of your blood in doing so. Go ahead and watch the dern thing (4/5 stars) - You'll understand. But hey - don't forgit the gin 
Brandenburg, a world famous photographer, sets out on a personal mission with his thinking and experience beautifully described in this stunning DVD. His pictures describe the Boundary Waters Wilderness with clarity and simplicity. One aches to be there with him and enjoy the natural setting and its beauty 
Photographer Jim Brandenburg takes you on his personal photographic journey that re-awakened his spirit and love of his craft after a burn out shooting for National Geographic magazine. Enchanting music from Michael Monroe accompanies the beautiful scenery and images from the northwoods of Minnesota. Jim reflects on some of his unique experiences while capturing some of the images on his journey. A must for photographers or anyone interested in wildlife and nature. Highly recommended. 
...how dumb movies can get. Then again, maybe I was stupid to expect a spark of intelligence in this film. Just to give you fair warning, Matt (the main character) is the only mildly pleasant person in this entire film. Matt decides to get rid of sex for Lent because of a bad break-up. In his endeavor, he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life. Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?) However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she? Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from? Normally I'm not this scathing in my reviews, but this film is the lowest of the low in intelligence and very high in crudeness. Not recommende 
Surviving 40 Days and Nights without Sex In the film 40 Days and 40 Nights, no sex is Kryptonite to Josh Hartnett's character, Matt because he cannot go through a day without thinking of sex and it ruins his social life by not being able to talk to girls without having sex on his mind. He strongly wants to follow through with his promise to himself by staying pure for the entire 40 days and nights. This film is perfectly made for Josh Hartnett for being such a teenage heartthrob. It's a wonderful comedy full of hilarity and sexy jokes. There are all kinds of things to laugh at such as the bagel guy to the crazy roommate. Many of the characters in the movie are funny and don't make Matt have such an easy time with the whole 40 days and 40 nights. It's not something that he is capable of doing and they all have faith that he will fail.  Matt being a raging sexaholic is a very strong character who attempts to not have sex for lent. Meaning for an entire 40 days and 40 nights he has to sacrifice what he enjoys most. Each day matt tries to do something constructive that helps him no think about sex, such as model car building and doing laundry. In the work place, Matt's co-workers start a bet to see which day he will break. It later turned into an online betting all over the internet. Prior to all of this he's been on a sex binge because of his girlfriend left him to dry. It's been the only thing that he knows and helps cope with the pain he's suffering. Matt starts to go through sex withdraw and everything he sees turns into some sexy act in his mind. He then meets a girl while doing this laundry one day. Easily there's an attraction but knowing that he cannot have contact with any female physically, he keeps to himself and doesn't say a word to her. As time goes on Matt starts to talk to her and makes a date with her. The date goes wonderful but instilled in his mind is that he can't have any sexual acts with this woman. She finds this weird and at her work place she came upon the website with the online bets. This made things very difficult for him and her. She starts to lose interest in him when he tells her the truth about what he can't do. This is the first time he's felt this way for a woman other than his ex-girlfriend. He truly falls for her and this time he didn't have to have sex. In his mind he wants to get her back so bad but he has that promise to himself that he feels is more important. Now the movie becomes the typical love story where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, then boy will get her back. In anybody's point of view 40 Days and nights is torture to a character like Matt. Since he's such a lady's man and is extremely sex dependent. Many people know that 40 days isn't that much but to him it feels like an eternity. 
Anyone who thoroughly enjoyed movies such as The Sweetest Thing, 10 Things I Hate About You and Sweet Home Alabama will love this movie. Josh Hartnett's sweet nature in this movie is very cute. Josh Hartnett fans everywhere should flock to this movie 
Maybe for some people, to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal, but in Matt Sullivan's case, it could be a total nightmare. After his girlfriend Nicole leaves him, Matt spends about six months devouring girls, until he starts to hallucinate. Advised by his brother, Matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems, and proposes to go through lent without sex. For Matt's friends, this odyssey is as absurd as impossible, and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last Matt's abstinence. He doesn't have it easy, as many temptations will make him suffer, and even smell the possibility of a new love. 40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character. In a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years, this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love. OH. WHAT A SHOCKING DISCOVERY! 
I bought the set and was very surprised to find that the episodes were much better than I remember them. I have to admit that they do not compare with the early All in the Family episodes, but neither do the later All in the Family episodes. But none the less, I am glad they are on DVD and am glad that I purchased them. Does anyone know if the second season will be available soon 
I love Archie Bunker,I have seansons 1-4 of All in the Family, I also have season 1 of Archie Bunker's place.I plan on getting all of both of these shows,I am 24 years old and I love this show 
I own every "All In The Family" season box set out on the market and started collecting the "Archie Bunker's Place" season box sets. Can someone please explain to me why we still get edited versions??? I thought the idea behind dvd is that we are supposed to get commercial free and unedited versions. To my knowledge, even All in the Family has a few edited episodes. Why are they doing this? It is frustrating 
"Archie Bunker's Place" was a wonderful sequel to the infamously wonderful sitcom 'All in the Family'. Winnipeg Manitoba was wondering about the picture of Beverly LaSalle on the back cover. You're right, the character of Beverly LaSalle died on All in the Family. It was a poignant 2-part episode during season 8 which was called, 'Edith's Crisis of Faith'. Shows like these will go down in the chronicles of television history and thanks to the studio companies for releasing these timepieces on DVD so the world can keep the memory of 'good television' alive today. 
Archie Bunker's Place is not All in the Family, but very few sitcoms are. If you give Archie's Bunker's Place a chance you will learn it is better then most highest rated sitcoms on the Air Today in 2006. This DVD set is very good with mostly uncut Episodes as they have not been seen since they aired on CBS. Archie New Partner Part 1 seems to be the same syndicated edited version that I recorded off WPSG CH 57in Philadelphia back in 1998 with Archie's great line to Harry about If Old McDonald had he not expanded farm into a fast food chain and that Cornel Sanders still would have been a private in the Army straggling chickens had he not taken a chance on his chicken joints were not included (These lines were kept in the TVLand edit in 2002). Other then that the rest of the episodes seems to be intact. Great liner notes Inside the DVD with episode credits 
I have always enjoyed All In The Family and consider it one of the best TV shows ever,in any genre.This series covers the "continuing adventures of Archie Bunker".It is definitely not as good as AITF but it is a logical extention of that series,especially in light of the fact that Rob Reiner,Sally Struthers and Jean Stapleton wanted to move on to other things and only Archie would remain (Stapleton was in ABP season 1 but was phasing out of the role). I never saw either series in their original run (too young),but I've seen AITF many,many times in reruns and on DVD.I hadn't seen ABP since it was rerun on WLVI Channel 56 in Boston many years ago,and it is great to see it again.My girlfriend had never seen it and is a big Archie fan,and she was thrilled to get it on the day of its release. Don't expect to see AITF,but if you are a fan of Archie Bunker you will enjoy this series.The fact that All In The Family ended,the whole cast but Archie basically changed,the show became a spin-off continuation,and it ran for 4 top 20 seasons tells you how powerful a character Archie was.It was still in the Top 20 when CBS pulled the plug.It seems that Archie could not be stopped 
I'm not sure why Sony Home Entertainment decided to start releasing "Archie Bunker's Place" on DVD before "All in the Family" was finished, nor do I know why they picked such a goofy-looking picture of Archie to put on the cover (What's up with that grin? He looks like a doofus!). However, I will still be purchasing this box set to go along with the AITF sets. Even though it's not as good as the original series, it's still worthy to own, especially when the episodes are the original uncut versions. As usual, Amazon is the best place to buy it from since it's cheaper than the brick and mortar stores and there's free shipping to boot! Buying this release will only serve to give the publisher more faith in anything with Archie Bunker, so the rest of the AITF seasons might not be too far behind. So, here's a good place to cast your vote for it! You'll enjoy this set for sure 
Archie Bunker is now the owner of Kelsey's Bar. In this new spin-off he changes the name of the bar, but Kelsey was the previous owner. The bar plays a major role because the title of the sitcom Archie Bunker's Place is describing the bar. On a later episode of All in the family we hear Edith say that Kelsey was Irish, so the bar was Irish. Even on the front of this DVD we see the bar in the background. This could account for the Shamrock on the cover. Its still a good spin-off but doesn't have the charm the original had 
Quite coincidentally, this movie was on television last night, right after I broke up with my boyfriend and he left. We broke up because he doesn't want to leave his 25 year marriage where there are now adult children, only to enter into my family (consisting of my little boy and me), and take on head of household, parental responsibilities again. While I was single a long time until I married (at the age of 38) he never had prolonged single time where he could be mostly self-centered. He wants that time now. So he left. Unlike this movie, he doesn't walk the streets like Billy Crystal, thinking how great it is to be alone and, allegedly, a free spirit, only to "see the light" and come racing to his girlfriend to tell he that he loves her, and "when you love somebody, you want your relationship to start right now"! No, in my case, he left and he hasn't called (even though I asked him not to), and I'm fairly certain he is not coming back. Very sad. But a great movie 
"When Harry Met Sally" is one of my favorite films. It's one of those movies you can watch again and again, and never get sick of it. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are hilarious, and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are excellent in their supporting roles. I can't recommend this movie enough. 
I just finished watching When Harry Met Sally for probably the tenth time. It's been years since I've seen it and I enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend. I couldn't get over the fact that I still laughed several times, almost as if I'd never seen the movie before. My interpretation, after all these years, was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments, infatuation, etc. without stooping to sugary sentiment. I took Harry and Sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable. I didn't see them as somehow representative of "all men" or "all women." Then I watched the extra documentary on the DVD which I had never seen until now. Big mistake. My new "interpretation" of the film was suddenly cast aside as I remembered that I actually didn't like this movie as much when it first came out. Over time I had grown to accept the fact that I could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved. What I had forgotten was Billy Crystal's, Rob Reiner's (director) and Nora Ephron's (writer) agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders. Gag. The views of the characters are presented as if they were fact. Men supposedly always think about sex and can't be friends with women. Most if not all women have faked an orgasm. All men are clueless to the fakery. And so on. I can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the Boomer generation and older folks (no one on this film is even close being a member of Gen X) because this does not represent the reality of all humans. You'll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to "prove" their case. If they'd interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it - "No, I won't fake it. If he sucks in bed I'm going to tell him." And as for men, some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it. None of this changes this classic film. That's the great thing about art - it's open to interpretation. I can watch this film and define it my way - two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love. Otherwise, I'd hate this movie. But I won't give Reinder, Ephron et al that much power. Just because they were narrow minded about gender roles doesn't mean I have to be about their film. If you agree with the characters in the film, by all means, watch the documentary. But if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters, pass it by. Don't let a DVD extra taint your pov 
For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable. One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with. Just FYI. 
Can men and women truely just be friends without sex getting in the way? That's the question the movie, 'When Harry Met Sally', asks and tries it's best to answer. This is the story of two characters that meet during a long drive to New York from the University Of Chicago. At first they can't stand each other, but they keep running into each other after years of never talking. They eventually become best friends and the previous question is put into play. I really like this movie. This is what a lot of people would call a "chick flick", but it's a movie that guys can get into as well. Billy Crystal plays the male lead and is great in the role. He is funny, as always, and this was the first movie I had seen him in. And what can you say about Meg Ryan that hasn't been said already? Wow. Everybody loves Meg Ryan. Guys think she is beautiful and retains that 'girl next door' quality at the same time. Women just love her movies, think she's a great actress, and find her 'cute'. This was the first of her many romantic roles that would go on to define her career. I honestly couldn't think of a better actress to play this role and she does it flawlessly. Carrie Fisher Bruno Kirby play key supporting roles here. Fisher is particularly good as Meg Ryan's best friend. Rob Reiner does another great job directing here and was really on a roll by the time this movie came out. Nora Ephron, who would later go on to direct her own 'chick flicks', wrote a great script that was basically based off of a lot of real life influences (including Reiner's divorce). Simply put, this is a great movie to sit and watch with your girlfriend. It's one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. Billy Crystal Meg Ryan have great chemistry and really own this movie. It's a very funny movie and it goes to show just how different men women really are. Special Features: There is a 35 min. documentary on the making of the movie. The movie was released in 1989, so having a documentary looking back at the movie was great. Rob Reiner, Nora Ephron, Billy Crystal do most of the talking here. Carrie Fisher has some moments. Meg Ryan doesn't appear except for old footage from '88. Overall it's a pretty good documentary and surprisingly informative. There are also seven deleted scenes included. They are all pretty good and could have been included in the movie. You also get a music video by Harry Connick Jr. (he did the music for the movie), trailer, and an audio commentary from Rob Reiner. Not a bad collection for a genre of movie ('Romantic Comedy') that rarely gets special addition treatment 
This movie is on my top 5 list. Harry Burns' theory that men and women can never be friends because the sex always gets it the way is dead nuts accurate. Sally tries to rebut this with a hypothetical...what if the girl is unattractive? Then can you be friends? To which Harry, in the spirit of all men, replies "No, you pretty much want to nail them too." Finally, a romantic comedy with some undertones that men can appreciate. Great movie 
In 1989, a good friend told me this film was excellent. I don't know why, but it took me 17 years to act on his good advice. In a way, I'm glad. Back then I might have simply liked the film. I'm not sure I would have recognized it for the evergreen, fresh and relevant classic that it is. Now, after one viewing, I can and do. Following their graduation from University of Chicago in 1977, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) is kissing his college sweetheart Amanda goodbye when Sally Allbright (Meg Ryan) pulls up in her station wagon to pick him up for the 18-hour shared drive they have arranged back to New York. On the drive, Harry tells an incredulous Sally that men and women can't be friends. Men always want to sleep with women, he says, noting that she is very attractive. When she finally drops him off at Washington Square Park at the foot of Fifth Avenue, Sally tells him to have a good life. They meet again five years later, in an airport, where Sally as Sally, now a journalist, kisses Joe goodbye. Harry, who is traveling on the same plane with Sally, is acquainted with Joe. He's a political consultant, and newly engaged to Helen. Once again, their personalities seem to clash. Another five years pass before Harry again spies Ally, this time in a bookstore with her friend Marie (Carry Fisher). Now, Harry is in the midst of a divorce, while Sally has split up with Joe. Over the next two years, they become the thing that Harry said men and women could never be--just friends. They try dating other people. They even try fixing one another up with their respective best friends, which brings the friends together as a couple, and leaves Harry and Sally still, just friends. Director Rob Reiner and writer Nora Ephron created a comic masterpiece in this film, but they could not have done it without the stellar performances from Crystal, Ryan, Fisher and Bruno Kirby, who plays Harry's friend, Jess. It's not only worth waiting for good things. Sometimes it's really nice, too. --Alyssa A. Lappe 
Watching Rob Reiners movies is almost always a great pleasure. He just gets to the point, without overkilling. He hits the nerve softly. He has the touch of telling the perfect joke. He tells stories that make you believe that you are in them. A true master in his craft. When Harry Met Sally is definitely one of his best. It's a film that does not get older. It stays fresh. It's a classic. Something that has to be seen, over and over again. J.J.Hartin 
I just rewatched this film and am amazed at how timeless it is - except for the clothing - of course ;) This film makes you laugh and shows the great dance of romance of a couple trying to find that ever elusive perfect timing. Another great film for girls' night : 
I love this movie, it is a cute movie, easy to watch, makes you smile alot. I think its a girl movie 
It's symptomatic of middle-age, I suppose, to reflect warmly on "the good old days", and even though I never wanted to fall into that syndrome, seeing "Help" has done exactly that for me. I was a Freshman in college when the movie was released, and so it was a movie for the millions of Boomers like me, in that bizarre, wonderful time that was the mid-1960's in America. Others have already written far more insightfully and fully than I intend to here. Simply -- if you like the Beatles, their witty, irreverent, and intellectual sense of humor, their music, and the whole 60's "British Invasion" period, you will surely enjoy this comedy. It was one last cheerful, happy, ridiculous romp for we teenagers of the 60's before the somber, discouraging misery of Vietnam settled in for a long, long time. It could be argued that, in a sense, my generation lost its sense of humor after "Help".... If a movie like "Help" were released today it would fall flat and be ridiculed, unless it were positioned as some kind of Austin Powers spinoff and "spoof" (how sick I've become of that word) of the "Hippie" period. Would this happen because as a people we never have regained that genuinely mirthful, joyous sense of humor that we revelled in in other Richard Lester movies, like "The Three Musketeers", "A Hard Day's Night", and Franco Zefferelli's "The Taming of the Shrew"? You make your own call... my generation lived it. Isn't it a pity that you can't buy "Help" new anymore? Isn't it interesting that the company that produced "Help" on DVD is MPI -- which is the same company that, despite overpowering demand, somehow cannot find it possible to release an even more popular, Academy Award-winning movie from the mid-Sixties -- "Becket"? Isn't it a pity that you can't buy both "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help" as a set? Isn't it a pity that no one makes movies like "Help" anymore 
This was the best movie that the beatles did it was funny and had a bit more of a plot this time. 'in the weeks that followed five more attemts were made to steal the ring.' Quite frankly my favorite attemt was number four he,he. But in 'another girl' we can only wish that Paul would wear that tshirt more often. and my stepsister finally realized that there are more rasons to like the beatles than their music. That is before John turned into mountain man\amish terrorist anyway. Okay! Now I'll actullay reveiw the movie. Help! was a clever movie, and had a plot! Imagine that! Anyway, the movie was about Ringo comming into possesion of a sacred ring. that wont come off. Sooo, Ringo must be sacrificed. So high preist Clang, and Aimee end up trying to sacrifice him. Or Clang is anyway. Aimee's trying to protect him. Prof. Foot and his assistant Algenon are after the ring too. so the beatles end up getting chased everywhere. The bahamas, the alps you know. Well i'm not gonna give away the ending so you'll just have to buy the movie and find out. So do it! it's worth it! 
Though not the landmark that "A Hard Day's Night" was, this film is still a lot of fun, and for current and future generations shows how the Beatles looked and behaved in 1965, in full color (in fact, the color cinematography is striking throughout--should have been nominated for an Oscar). But rather than write a regular review, this is a plea to restore the film and present it in a special edition. The laserdisc from Criterion had many more features than the now out of print DVD release, including photographs that thoroughly detail a lost, deleted scene early in the film with comedian Frankie Howerd--and this scene set up a later scene, which doesn't make as much sense until you understand the context from the deleted scene... The later scene is the one at Scotland Yard where Klang calls Superintendent Gluck's office. As soon as the Beatles hear the music coming over the phone they plug their ears ("It's them!"), and the inspector goes into a trance. The question is, how did the Beatles know the music came from Klang, and to plug their ears? The answer was revealed in the deleted scene. Briefly, the Beatles visit a guru played by Howerd, where Klang and his henchmen appear and use the music to put the Beatles into a trance (with Ringo incapacitated, Klang was going to cut off the drummer's finger, but is foiled by George, who for the sake of the plot was conveniently wearing earplugs and impervious to the music's hypnotic effects). Having once been exposed to the music, they knew to plug their ears in the scene at Scotland Yard. (BTW, two pictures of the deleted scene are at the film's photo section at imdb.com, and unless it has since been corrected Howerd is incorrectly identified as Brian Epstein in the photos' caption.) Perhaps the scene has been found since the Criterion laserdisc was released, and if so it would be a very special feature. But footage aside, for me the ideal special edition DVD would have two soundtracks, with the original mono soundtrack and mixes of the songs, as well as the later stereo mixes. The original soundtrack may have also contained Foley effects over the songs(i.e. sounds outside of the dialog, like footsteps and the such--perhaps even the sound of the darts hitting the screen in the opening number?) that was eradicated when the distributors replaced the mono songs with those in stereo. Finally the restored version would have the most glaring omission from all the DVD releases--the original aspect ratio. I recall reading quotes from the distributors of the previous releases defending the release of "Help!" in a full screen, stating that it wasn't a widescreen movie to begin with. OK, it wasn't "El Cid", but then again it wasn't as squarish as the TV screen, and viewing the previous releases you can obviously see that there is more than what is viewed full screen. There was no reason not to release it widescreen and this version MUST have that restored. (It's still amazes me that the Criterion LD was also fullscreen considering presenting discs widescreen was one of their big selling points at the time.) I hope this doesn't get too buried under all the other reviews--in fact I hope that someone inflential sees this and takes action. Otherwise I hope someone somewhere in the Beatles' org is thinking about this and it actually happens--provided the original elements, like the mono soundtrack, aren't altogether lost. 
I first saw Help! when I was in middle school, rifling through my parents' VHS collection. My friends and I were won over by this silly comedy and the Fab Four, and I have treasured the movie ever since. It is unfortunate that the US DVD release is out of print (I had to buy an imported version), and I hope they bring it back soon, so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy. The plot is pure genius in its simplicity: a gaudy red ring gets stuck on Ringo's finger. A sacrificial cult chases him around the world, trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice. A mad scientist is determined that he could--dare I say it?--rule the world, if he could only get the ring off Ringo's finger. The Beatles are absolutely clueless. So they run around the world, dodging crazy people at every turn, singing songs, and generally being hilarious. The DVD I bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in French. So once you've seen Help! enough times to know every line by heart, try it out in a foreign language, and laugh even harder at The Beatles speaking in French. Go... to... THE WINDOW... GO... TO... the window.. 
The Beatles accomplished so much - good at music , good at recording and capturing their magic , good at transferring their personalities and appeal onto film . HELP ! is meant to be fun and it has some slapstick elements mostly due to Ringo's abilities as a straight man . He was always the most honest one and he holds the film together . If anyone feels he didn't do as much as the others , then this film is the evidence to the contrary . The Beatles' humour style incorporates elements of the Goons and Peter Sellers , who was a friend of theirs . Enjoy this silly film and marvel at the best of the songs in it . 
HELP hit theater screens in 1965 in glorious color -- or colour, if you prefer. The previous year's A HARD DAY'S NIGHT had budget constraints that restricted it, among other things, to black and white. With the runaway success of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, the ante was upped considerably to provide HELP with color negative, numerous location shoots, fabulous sets, and (what we could call today) superb music videos. Richard Lester again took the directorial helm of this second Beatles movie. Richard Lester films have traditionally been off beat comedies and HELP is no exception. Unlike HARD DAY'S NIGHT, where the screenplay called for the Beatles to act through an exaggerated simulated -- and believable -- day in their lives, HELP had a cloak and daggar plot. We find religious zealots from the mystic east chasing Ringo across southern England, Switzerland, and the Bahamas to recover a sacred sacrificial ring. The incompetence of the pursuers is barely exceeded by the Beatles protectors: Scotland Yard. Okay, so there is not much plot here. HELP is basically a fun filled romp with the Beatles with some great music included. In fact, the budget was so generous that film locations were chosen almost arbitrarily to provide the Beatles with mini vacations. The Beatles, of course, play themselves. Veteran actor Leo McKern is the chief villian. Victor Spinetti, who entertained us as the television producer in HARD DAY'S NIGHT, returns as the mad scientist. Lovable Roy Kinnear (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Three Musketeers) is the professor's assistant. Eleanor Bron (A Little Princess) and Patrick Cargill (Around the World in Eighty Days) also costar. HELP has been re-released twice since the 1980s. The only drawback to this film is that the original movie soundtrack was "improved." In the original print, which occasionally shows up on AMC, the original music soundtrack, complete with background sound effects, is still present. The new DVD release uses digitally remastered music that can be found on the CD soundtrack. Unfortunately, not all of these versions are the same tracks from the original movie. For example, the title song, HELP, is the version from the American Capitol LP. The original film used the single version. The original track, which can be found on old Capitol/Apple 45 rpm singles -- as well as on the Beatles Rarities album -- is slightly faster and has a heavier vocal emphasis on the word "Help." Other songs are missing subtle background sound effects as they were blotted out by the redubbing of the music tracks. The DVD has a few special features including the movie trailer. It is too bad that the original black and white promotional film for the song HELP, that we see during the opening credits, (albeit without darts hitting the screen) is not included on the DVD. Still, the DVD is a marked improvement over the last 20 years worth of VHS releases. In my younger years I enjoyed HELP much more than A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. Now I am not so sure. They are two very diverse films. I give five stars to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT for originality and four stars to HELP for color and music 
if you remember the 60s and the james bond era,then this movie needs no introduction to you..its simply sensational and holds up well as far as the era it was made in goes. for newer viewers,it may seem confusing. the beatles were at thier peak when they did this movie. they were the biggest thing in music no matter what anyone says. and they knew it. that comes accross to some viewers as they "just did whatever they wanted" and they certaintly did! the james bond connection will come once the newer/younger fan sees goldfinger or thunderball... the beatles themselves called this movie as it was..and excuse to enjoy anyplace or any plot they wanted. a must own no matter who you are..as long as you like the beatles. be open and enjoy 
It is a pleasure to watch The Beatle's film "Help." It's easy listening, lighthearted and a nice "snapshot" in time when they were all enjoying being at the top of their game! All the songs featured were big hits and are well woven into the framework of the movie. Nevertheless, to have another opportunity to experience the dry subtle humor of John Lennon is worth the purchase on it's own! But to know that this was one of the first exposures of Indian music for George Harrison, and to witness this milestone that influenced the rest of his musical and spiritual life, is an extremely rare treat indeed. Ringo Starr continues to entertain with his own brand of whimsical laconicism that remains unequaled and Paul McCartney is very warmly enjoyable in his portrayal of a love-struck member of the band with the lovely leading High Priestess. A must see for new and renewed fans alike 
my neighbor totoro is another film from the same guy who made howl's moving castle. it has the same kind of story and if you like how�'s moving castle then this is one that you would like to see too 
My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother, who is in a nearby hospital. The animation is stunningly done, with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum. Voice acting in the original Japanese is great and the english dub is not far behind. This is one of the best dubs I have heard, with the English voice actors obviously 'getting' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required. My wife and I both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters, age 6 and 2. (Causing them to buy a number of other Ghibli films) Highly recommended 
Family movies don't get much better than this. No double-entendres, no sex/violence, and yet most (mature) adults will find it most enjoyable. Miyazaki's animation style is always a welcome touch. There are Japanese cultural references so the uninitiated might be confused at times, however, the story transcends most boundaries and is simply a good "friendly spirit" movie. Kids will enjoy Totoro and his friends as well as the fact that the children are the focus and stars of the movie. Adults will find the family situations strikingly realistic and will easily identify with (and get a chuckle out of) several conversations between parents and their children. This is one of those movies from which you will get the "warm fuzzies." Share it with others in your family 
A good animated film, with a realistic presentation of the interaction of siblings to both enjoyable and frightful situations. It also protrays children's ready acceptance of unusual or supernatural. The father's unquestioning willingness to go along with and support of his kids is also quite warming 
My granddaughter absolutely loves this movie and she's only one year old. Not to mention that my husband and I saw the movie first and decided we had to buy it for her. We have watched and enjoyed it many times. 
The world of totoro is such a magical place. Totoro will lead you on the adventure of a life-time. Just hop on the cat-bus, and we're off! I would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5, for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world. It's just sop magical..in the beautiful world of totoro...you'll always be safe.....sorry! Got sorta lost in my own world there! Well, anyway, please buy this movie! It's the best in the whole entire world! Please! 
My wife, 4 year old daugthter and I all liked Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery service, and so a friend recommended this movie to me. He said it was a great family movie. It didn't sound that interesting so I didn't purchase it right away. Finally, one day when I saw a link about it on Amazon, I decided to go for it. We had no idea what we were in for, but not one of us was disappointed. If fact, the whole family has watched Totoro at least 10 times since we bought it only a 2 months ago. My daughter espcially cannot get enough of it. It is very fun, heart warming and humorous. We recommend every family get a copy of this movie. You won't regret it. We have since collected 5 of Miazaki, and Studio Ghibli's films, and we plan to purchase more in the future. BTW, if you like this, also check out "Wisper of the Heart", another great Studio Ghibli film. Have fun, we know you will if you watch this movie 
This is an excellent movie for all ages! Get it now. Experience the magic. Wonderful story, acting, and attitude sets this movie from all others 
My Neighbor Totoro is a simply wonderful story. It portrays innocence and family love at its best and is very delightful to watch. 
The story was both simple and unencumbered yet soulful and sweet. The movie has pleasant and beautiful animation (bright colors, soft lines). The characters (and their offscreen personalities) all are present and make for a fine children's film that both children will enjoy and parents can endure (I had to sit through Pokemon movies - most of them too, yuck!). For me, the best part of the film was the soundtrack. Jack Johnson's tuneful songs with catchy lyrics made the film very special. The soundtrack quickly became one of my favorite CDs. A must see film for small children. This film is destined to be a classic and reminded me why I loved the Curious George books when I was a child myself 
Curious George is fantastic. Although many people might think that this movie is only made for children, adults will get a kick out of this movie as well. The music that accompanies the film is great. It is a warm story that allows you to escape from adult life drudgery and remember what it is to explore and be curious about the world. 
I didn't grow up reading Curious George books as I was little. So this movie was my first exposure to the character, and now I know everyone in my family will be reading (and watching) George for a very long time. The story was cute and touching, yet at the same time it was fun and engaging. The animation was simple but very tasteful, giving the characters a special "glow" that made them stand out and offering numerous shots using angles that are not too usual in animated features (I particularly remember the one of George running on top of buildings trying to catch Ted -the yellow hat man- where the shot is shown from above, as if there were a flying camera focusing on George). In the end, you feel great when the movie is over and, to keep you entertained longer, there's lots of fun extra features to even teach you how to draw George. So whether you are a parent, a kid or simply an admirer of nice animated stories, Curious George is a winner for all 
*Curious George* was a cute movie. Overall, I enjoyed it. It was a simple storyline with George, along with his curiosity, getting himself and the man in the yellow hat in trouble. Anyways, I had a couple of good laughs. Even though this movie was geared towards kids, you could pick up a couple of lines that were meant for adults. It was a bit puzzling to see Ted (the man in the yellow hat) as a goofball. Nonetheless, it worked well into the movie. ...and George named after George Washington?!?!? Anyways, like I said, cute movie that anyone will enjoy. 
My four year old loved this movie. The plot was very simple and easy to follow, nothing too complicated for her. The animation was also great for the movie's target audience, very soft and warm. It's a good-hearted little film and George is such a sweet, funny and cute little guy throughout. It was light on plot, probably easily predictable by anyone over the age of six, but such a cute movie that I didn't get bored watchingn it with her. This is a great movie for young children 
This a very well done remake of a children book. It kept thing simple with the basic idea of George being curious (running into trouble/ adventure) in search for the Man in the Yellow Hat. I never felt the storyline or voice-acting were every over the top like the Cat in the Hat. Not as fanatic as CG and other animations coming out this days. I would recommend this as a solid family movie. DVD problem: There is some issue with this movie on older DVD set in which it does not play or freeze/ skip. This is very annoying base on a new type of encoding. Why did I watched a children movie, just curious how George has grown? Curious George doesn't talk if you were wondering, but the Man in the Yellow Hat does. 
Well, I rented this movie for my seven year old step-daughter because I grew up on Curious George and wanted to share that adventure with her. As well, she only speaks spanish and this movie has a spanish language track. I watched the movie before her to hear it in english. I tell you, I was swept in from the DVD menu. This is an absolutely adorable movie, from the animation, the voices of Wil Ferrel and others, to the music, to the way too cute Curious George, to the wonderful feel of the story. There are even some nice lessons about honesty and love. Personally, I loved this movie, and I'm 40 years old. The spanish voice overs were very well done as well, and my daughter also loved the movie, although I laughed out loud more often than her. I'll be waiting for the sequel. 
I couldn't get into this movie. It was boring, too long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over with. George was annoying and he should've been tranquilized and thrown into the zoo. The only thing I liked about the movie was the use of computer animation to enhance the traditional cartooning 
Well loved children's character Curious George is now on DVD in a brand new feature length adventure. Curious George the animated feature includes the voice talent of Drew Barrymore and Will Ferrell. Kids won't really care who lends voice talent to this gem. As the film begins, Ted, the Man in the Yellow hat is seen working a museum when the museum is suddenly in a financial crisis. To save the museum, Ted is summoned to the museum curator's office and sent on a mission to Africa to look for a mysterious item that will bring visitors back to the museum. Ted heads to the Outback Outfitter store where he is fitted with his trademark yellow suit. Once he arrives in Africa with the crew, Ted is shocked to discover what they felt would be a huge item that would save the museum, is actually a small little statue that fits into the palm of his hand. Ted does meet a curious, fun little brown monkey. As he leaves Africa set for the shores of America, the little monkey, who has taken his yellow hat, stows away on the ship. Soon after he arrives back home, Ted discovers that the little monkey, who he names George is a part of his life at home. Kids will really love this film--mine did. The DVD also includes some cool bonus features. The games are easy to play with the DVD remote. There are also DVD-ROM features. The running time of Curious George is one hour and twenty eight minutes. 
This is a great movie. I think Al Pacino and Robin Williams definitely clicked in this movie. The plot was excellent and Pacino shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time 
Al pacino plays a detective who comes to nightmute alsaka to investigate A murderer then the shoot out incident detective dormer by mistake shoots his own partner and he tells them the murderer did it. He has real bad insomnia because of the everlasting daytime which he is not quite use to and with alot of guilt of shooting his partner. He creates fake evidence so they will think that the murderer (robin williams) did it. Very good movie 
This is another american remake of the original Danish movie, starring Stellan Skarsgard, which is more interesting than this remake. I always wonder why, when Hollywood does a remake, they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place. Even though I give this remake 4 stars, mainly because Al Pacino and Robin Williams restrained themselves, and that Hollywood changed the ending. Check out the original. I give the Danish original 5 stars. 
Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, "ever since I saw Batman Begins" and find his artistic vision to be incredible. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice. However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this. 
Al Pacino plays the morally conflicted police officer with some secrets who is doing his best to help solve a murder in Alaska during the long days of summer when the sun never sets. The white landscape and the gray mental clarity from his insomnia make this an interesting psychological morality tale. Patrick J. McGerve 
It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so 
Christopher Nolan's "Insomnia" is a fantastic film, that manages to top the original. This police thriller is hypnoticly enthralling from beginning to end. Al Pacino has one of his best roles in years.(He's still the man!) Robin Williams was better in "One Hour Photo", but he's not glaringly miscast as others claim.The rest of the cast is first-rate, with Hillary Swank being particularly good. The credit for this film's greatness belongs to Director Nolan. He's created a tense,visually unique picture that transcends genre cliches, and stands as one of the best movies of the decade. 
This is one of the "big" 1960s Warner Bros. musicals.While definitely not in the same class as "My Fair Lady" or "The Music Man",it's as good as "Finian's Rainbow" and MUCH better than "Camelot".Leonard Speigelgass's script wisely lets Arthur Laurents' book virtually speak for itself.John Beckman and Ralph Hurst's sets,Orry-Kelly and Howard Shoup's costumes,Harry Stradling's photography,and Frank Perkins's musical direction are all excellent.Mervyn LeRoy's direction is very good, especially in the dramatic scenes.The cast is excellent,with Rosalind Russell,Natalie Wood,and Karl Malden particularly outstanding. Faith Dane,Roxanne Arlen,and Jean Willes stop the show with a hilarious "You Gotta Get A Gimmick".All in all,a good 1960s musical that provides an evening of solid entertainment 
I love musicals and "Gypsy" is one of my faves. I adore Rosalind Russell's portrayal of Rose and love Natalie Wood, too. It's really got it all. Great songs, great performances...a classic I can watch over and over 
My mother took me to the movies to see Gypsy, starring Rosalind, when I was about 10 years old. I fell in love with the movie. Natalie Wood became a beautiful swan. I just love that movie. I watched the movie with my daughter although she had seen it on tv with all the commercials. She enjoyed it so much I am going to purchase her a copy. 
Based on the hit Broadway play, Mervyn LeRoy directed this under-appreciated musical gem. Rosalind Russell is Mama Rose, the mother of all stage mothers, grooming her two young daughters for stardom on the vaudeville stage. She pays special attention to her youngest child, blond Baby June, while Louise is relegated to the background. As time goes on, the vaudeville craze fades with the coming of talkie films, and now her bubbly blond darling, Danity June (Ann Jilliann), is desperate to break free, deserting the family act. Rose is forced to start from scratch, with wallflower Louise (Natalie Wood, who was always in her sister's shadow), as the headliner in a new act, which basically goes nowhere. One day, Rose and her troop, now called Rose Louise and her Hollywood Blondes, wind up in a burlesque theater, and young Louise finds herself drawn into the the role of a stripper. She sheds her shy persona and becomes the world's most famous stripper, Gypsy Rose Lee. Ethel Merman originated Rose on the stage, but Roz Russell does more than an adequate job, despite the fact that her singing voice was dubbed in some musical numbers. She is strong, overbearing, a little eccentric, but at the same time, she commands the audience's sympathy when she realizes that her ambition has just driven her daughters away, and she finds herself alone, with no one to live through anymore. Natalie Wood gives a touchingly vulnerable performance, her thin but endearing singing voice expressing Louise's pain and confusion in extraordinary volumes. Since she was groomed by an obsessive stage mother herself, Wood really had the the material to draw from; her lessons from the real Gypsy Rose Lee undoubtedly helped in her character's transformation from a shy girl to sophisticated stripper (the striptease numbers are fabulous). Who doesn't shed her a tear when she sings, "Little Lamb", or feels enthralled as she performs "Let Entertain You"? As she studies herself before a mirror prior to her first night on the burlesque stage, she sees her beauty for the first time - "I'm pretty - I'm a pretty girl, Mama!" When she makes her mark, she engages in an argument with her controlling mother, bringing both to a heartache, and later, an understanding. "You really could have been something, Mother," Louise informs Rose after catching a bit of her "performance" on the empty stage. Having seen the 1993 version starring Bette Midler, I still prefer this one; no matter what anyone says, Roz is not miscast, and this film does not, in my opinion, have any "clumsy" moments; it is a vintage Hollywood musical. Karl Malden gives a comedic and committed performance as Rose's suitor Herbie, who wants her to marry him and who wants to provide a home for her kids. A young Morgan Brittney plays little Baby June; seeing her makes you think of her as the "Jon Benet" of the 1920s. It's finally on DVD, as it deserves to be; the letterbox enhances the film in a way that pan-and-scan videos never could. Everything's coming up roses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
I loved this version as a little girl , and grew up with it. I usually do not comment on others reviews , but I feel I MUST respond to a comment ,that this version of Gypsy is definately NOT a classic.SO WRONG ! How could anyone say this masterpiece is NOT a classic ?? It is the role that made Natalie Wood a star! The movie is wonderful,and as far as Roz not having a good singing voice,I believe that was done ON PURPOSE.I am quite sure the producer/director knew she had a rough voice. She portrayed a "tough broad" as some might say , who was street smart , and some songs don't have the typical "good voice" to them - Look at Joe Cockers "You are so beautiful" His voice cracks more than once , and especially at the end of the song, and THAT song STAYED number one for a very long time , and is still a classic today...so yes , her voice is rough , but again I say , that was intentional.Her whole demeanor was rough around the edges. As far as all the characters being mismatched , I feel quite the contrary. They meshed beautifully.The movie has that wonderful nostalgic quality that puts you right there , and you really feel for all of the characters. This musical has such DEPTH , Great acting/singing , It's fun , and snappy ,and happy ,and sad ,and ... just everything that movies today aren't .This musical is pure entertainment ,It actually takes you away and puts you right there ,feeling all the emotions of the characters :The sadness of Mama's favortism toward June. Louise's anger toward her mama, The Mama's sadness at Louise's rejection of her after she becomes a stripper. The sadness of Joe(?) (It's been so long I can't even remember if this was his name) when Roz wouldn't marry him. The upbeat song "Mama get married today" and the so very sad song "Little hen Little fish" that Louise sang to her Birthday present...you definately get caught up in the performances. I say , If you've never seen it: Watch it. If you HAVE seen it: Revisit it again. It is like seeing an old friend. I haven't seen it in a long time, but I have looked for it in different stores under musicals or classics, and I can never find it. Hopefully I can find a copy on Amazon. I always wished they would make a Gypsy 2 set in that era , but of course , even if they did , it couldn't touch the original...Which brings me back to my point in the beginning , It is a CLASSIC , and a great one at that , and always will be. I just wish I could give it TEN stars 
I give this version 2 stars, 1 for Natalie Wood, who is superb, and 1 for the story itself. Rosiland Russell who was a great actress,(Auntie Mame, The Women), but definately not a singer, is miscast big time!! If they had done the right thing and cast Ethel Merman, the combination of Merman and Natalie Wood would make this a classic today, which it definately is not. The Bette Midler version is far superior 
This is by far the best version of this musical. The song and dance numbers are excellent and the characters strong. Orchestration is bright and snappy and true to the original stage score. A classic that every serious collector should have ! 
I love "Gypsy." I remember seeing this film when I was 7 with my Mom and Sister,and it was condemed by the Catholic church.My Mom was so worried she would go to hell when she found out later this was on the list of movies not to see.Everyone is fantastic,and I love Natalie Woods performance,but this is Rosalind Russell's movie.She's so funny,and the energy this women had is unreal,and for a person who can't sing,I could hear her version of "Everythings comming up Rosses" everyday,and still enjoy it.This is a Classic,and I'm going to watch this DVD again tonight 
The catch phrase used repeatedly in this 1962 Warner Bros screen version of the Broadway classic "Gypsy" is "let me entertain you!", and that is certainly what this wonderful musical succeeds perfectly in doing. Boasting off screen credentials such as Stephen Sondheim for lyrics, choreography by Jerome Robbins and direction by Hollywood veteran Mervyn Leroy, with a superb cast from the legendary Rosalind Russell, through to Natalie Wood and Karl Malden, you just know this movie is going to be something special. Debate still rages over the casting of Rosalind Russell in the central role of the stage mother from hell, Rose Hovick in place of Broadway legend Ethel Merman who had one of her greatest Broadway triumphs in the role. In much the same way as Audrey Hepburn's casting as Eliza Doolittle over Julie Andrews in "My Fair Lady" drew heated discussion, the debate over "Gypsy", will undoubtedly continue forever. Rosalind Russell certainly makes the central character of the pushy, dominering stage mum her own here and provides in my belief much of what is memorable in this film version of the classic story. Indeed "Gypsy", still has that warm appealing show biz flashiness about it that makes a viewing a wonderful nostalgic experience. There have been many back stage stories filmed but "Gypsy", is certainly one of the best of it's kind and boasts many fine qualities that allow it to stand on it's own artistic merits side by side with its illustrious Broadway parent. "Gypsy", of course recounts the rise to notoriety of one of last centuries most famous burlesque queens, the one and only Gypsy Rose Lee. Of course the most colourful character in the story and the one most prominently featured in Arthur Laurent's book on which the play was based was that of the mother the unstoppable Momma Rose Hovick who was unrelenting in her push to see her daughters as stars of the vaudeville circuit. The film chronicles the ambitions of Momma Rose through a long series of performing engagements across America where the spot light is always on the youngest of the three times married Rose's two daughters, June. In an act headlined by "Baby" June (Morgan Brittany billed as Suzanne Cupito), who slowly develops through the years into "Dainty", June (Ann Jillian) the format never changes and finds elder daughter Louise reduced to being the front end of a cow prop used in the act. Rose has an unfailing belief in the talent of her daughters and brushes aside the attentions of besotted manager Herbie Sommers(Karl Malden), because he wants to marry Rose, settle down and give the girls a proper home in one place. As the years go by the families fortunes take a turn for the worst and the great Depression wipes out the last vestiges of the old vaudeville circuit. Living from hand to mouth "Dainty June", becomes tired of always playing a child and runs off and gets married. Rose turns her attention on the less extroverted Louise and revamps the act to spotlight her. However all the magic has gone and when the troupe are booked in as a support act at a burlesque theatre the whole group's lives are changed forever. Louise is dragged in to replace a missing act and despite it involving a strip tease number Rose sees the chance for Louise to gain star status and thus "Gypsy Rose Lee", is born. Louise becomes an unexpected sensation and celebrity in burlesque however Rose begins to feel shut out and having also lost Herbie who tired of waiting for her to marry him she sees a lonely old age on her own ahead of her. However in the best tradition of show business a reconciliation occurs at the eleventh hour which sees the overpowering Momma Rose back in her daughters life for a happy finale. Coming on the heels of its Broadway predecessor this movie version does not suffer at all for the changes in cast. Rosalind Russell a fine comedian from right back in the 1930's does a wonderful job of bringing this monsterous but still likeable stage mother to life. The character is essentially a combination of many notorious Broadway and Hollywood stage mothers and she brings her great comic skills to the forefront to make Rose the most meaty character in the story. What is important about Russell's performance is that she always manages to bring the deep down humanity behind the ruthless ambition into her playing of Rose and her scenes towards the end of the film when Gypsy has discarded her are nothing short of brilliant in turning audiences sympathies back onto her character. Natalie Wood, one of Hollywood's most beautiful young women of the time plays the central role of Gypsy and she displays just the right elements of awkwardness and vulnerability in her early scenes combined with the supreme confidence she displays in the later scnes when she is a great success as a burlesque Queen. She has great chemistry with Rosalind Russell and their scenes when the power base in the relationship changes are especially noteworty. Karl Malden has the difficult role of Herbie, Rose's long time love and he makes great dramatic worth out of his decades long love for a woman more interested in turning her children into stars than getting married to him. His departure scene when he finally says goodbye to Rose is particulary poignant. Finally young Ann Jillian deserves special mention for her wonderful playing of "Dainty", June, Momma's favourite who is never allowed to grow up in the act. The scenes of her as a teenager still playing a baby are both comical and tragic if there is such a thing possible. The overall production of "Gypsy", does great credit to its Broadway parent and the period recreation over many decades, stunning costumes designed by the legendary Orry Kelly and the wonderful choreography by Jerome Robbins is first rate. Despite her different singing style to Broadway's Ethel Merman, Russell handles the musical numbers with relish including "Everthing's Coming Up Roses", "Some People", "You'll Never Get Away From Me",and "Rose's Turn". While I'm not an authority on Broadway musicals I always find "Gypsy", has a fresh and endearing quality to its story that while being at times brash is also sensitive and moving in its quieter moments. Would Ethel Merman have made the part of Rose a truly memorable creation in the movie version? Who knows but what we have here is one of the better early 1960's Hollywood musicals that succeeds on many different levels. Put some time away soon and catch this great Hollywood musical, Rosalind Russell is sure to dazzle you with her energy, and with the uniqueness of her stage mum to end all stage mums, enjoy!!! 
Without a doubt, Dave Chappelle created one of the greatest shows to air on television, but I might just be saying too much...or not. Everything he does will crack you up and if it doesn't you have no sense of humor. While I don't have the first season yet, I have seen the whole thing, and it is worth the purchase 100%. Dave Chappelle isn't a blind comedian who let's power get in his way. He knows what's best for him and that is another reason why he is one of the best comedians in America today. There are many hilarious sketches that somehow were beat by the next season, but that's no reason to skip this set! This contains all the episodes fully uncensored, as we want them and funny as h e l l commentary by Dave and Neal. There are also bonus features that need your attention. There is no thinking over to do, go buy it now 
this was and still is one of the best skit comedy shows out at the time. dave's natural gift of comedy is very well suited to this outrageous and howling,profaine,and insightful show. mr. chappelle has taken some great bits and turned skit comedy on it's ear! this set isn't for everyone,but if like me the skit of the blind,black white supermacist(watch to understand) is just the funniest bit i have seen in years. like i said this is not for all taste as the laungage is very corse and the skits are very much geared for adults(keep the kids away!!!), but for those with the sence of humor to like dave this is a great collection to have! 
The Chapelle show is equal parts hit or miss or near-miss. For every brilliant sketch that has you simultaneously shaking your head in amazement while you slap your knee in amusement (a hit), there is a bit where you just shake your head at how embarrasingly lame it is. (The miss.) And then there are the solid bits that are pretty funny, but no great shakes. HITS: A blind black white supremacist? Genius. And for some reason, I love the musical interlude where Dave and Mos Def cruise around while Mos Def raps. NEAR MISS: The Real World sketch with a white guy staying with some of the most criminal blacks that Dave and his writers could concoct was so "real" and cruel, it was just brutal... yet kind of funny too. MISS: Lots and lots of lame sketches 
Chappelle's Show is a hilarious piece of work that should be required viewing for all.Some sweet stuff like the R. Kelly Spoof,Dave playing a psychic,The magic Video Camera,Spoofs of famous movies like Deep Impact,The Matrix and Pretty Woman,and so much more makes this set a must have for anyone.A Highly Reccomended Laugh Riot. 5 stars and a bag of chip 
I got the Dave Chapelle's Seasons 1 2 for my husband as a Valentine's Day gift and he loved it. Definitely recommended! 
This DVD is hilarious. It is well worth the money and I can watch it over and over again. Dave Chappelle is a great comedian and I am just sorry there won't be any more seasons to purchase 
The funniest show around! This is the funniest show i've seen since Mad TV. Dave Chappelle is a genius. I put him up with Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy any day. This dvd was crazy. I really loved the Crack Head (Tyrone Biggums). You really need to get this dvd. You do not know what you are missing!!!! 
This dvd rocks! This dude is as funny as they come. Very original and different. The new king of comedy 
After being thouroughly amused by Chapelle's Show Season 2 on DVD I purchased the Season 1 DVD box set, since I had only seen a few shows from the debut series. While this is a worthy set to own, it's not as funny as the second season. Few of the skits will have a lasting effect on you and just arent memorable. It's funny but just not as funny as the season 2 DVD box set 
I really didn't think I was going to like this show, but it's actually pretty good. It isn't the funniest thing I've ever seen, but it's well done, decently funny, the characters come across as real people for the most part, and there isn't any smug condescension towards them. The performances are good for this type of thing. Some of my favorite moments are Thomas Lennon's closeted gay cop getting his bike stolen constantly, the jokes the cops play on unsuspecting motorists (like arresting the pizza delivery guy so they could take his pizza), the episode where the "homeland security" guy fools all of the Reno police department, and when the FBI comes in for a murder investigation, and reduces the department to a bunch of gophers. You're not going to see groundbreaking, brilliant satire here, but you won't be bored, either. Overall, a decent series. 
When you love being with the characters of a show, does the plot-line matter? The answer is 'yes' if you are a fan of the only reality show on TV, 'COPS.' Much like the comedy classics 'WKRP,' 'Mary Tyler Moore,' 'Cheers' and others, 'Reno 911' gives us characters who are fun to be with. They are confused, silly, illogical, occasionally dim-witted and even racist at times. A camera zooms in on any one of them seemingly out of nowhere at a moment's notice and shows us glimpses of them engaged in petty workplace back-stabbing, gossip or romance. In the meantime, they are all in sheriffs' department uniform, crashing the police car, conducting stings that go wrong, firing their guns with reckless abandon, deciphering vanity plates on cars while in high-speed pursuit, and chasing bizarre criminals around Reno or its trailer parks. (In addition to being on the Reno police force, Niecy Nash, also the star of the home improvement show 'Clean House,' provides face-blurred cameos of a wacko woman with a penchant for disturbing the peace and stealing police cars and weapons. In the final episode, watch for Garcia, played by Carlos Alazraqui, to lose it and disappear off-camera laughing hysterically at Ms. Nash's escapades.) I discovered 'Reno 911' while channel-flipping and tuned in for a few repeat episodes because a) it was truly funny, and, b) was a spoof of one of my all-time favorite shows, 'COPS.' I had never bought a television-show-on-DVD before and decided that I wanted to give this one a try and watch this particular series sequentially and commercial free beginning with episode 1. I am so glad I did. Thankfully, there is no laugh track, nor is there one on TV either. Each episode is skillfully and evenly written and produced, very funny and stands alone. (Some episodes also include audio commentary.) This stuff works. Highly recommended for all students of comedy and fans of 'COPS. 
It is hilariously quirky. Very random just as I like i 
I was first introduced to this show by a friend in the USA (I'm in Australia) who asked if I'd seen it. No, I hadn't. Then I saw an episode on cable in a hotel and I knew what he was talking about. The situations are great - lots of improv but you'd never know it - it's very natural. This show is the funniest on tv, I bought a multi-region DVD player just so I could watch this. I know some Cops who have seen it and they say it's funny as hell. You can't get much better than that. Lot's of "in" jokes for real Cops too. If you know a cop, buy it for them! I love the start of shift briefings - quickdraw to see who has to go out and buy lunch. THAT is funny 
THIS SEASON IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN FOLKS. IT WILL HAVE YOU ROLLING ON THE FLOOR OVER AND OVER. IT IS WORTH IT 
Great shows! Had to call 911 to help me stop laughing. It's just too funny 
Amazon was spot on again, with fast delivery and the show was what i expected. For anyone who has seen the show you know what to expect. For those who haven't it will be a fun new experience 
A truly original series of non-stop laughs. Pay attention, there is a lot of subtle humor that is brilliant but not always caught the first time around. Dangle and the gang are great 
Reno 911 is one of the best comedy spoofs on television today. The comedy is original and catches the viewer unaware. The set-up of the jokes and the visual punch lines provide a new type of comedy entertainment, in the same way as the Monty Python routines broke new comedy ground. The actors of Reno 911 portray a wonderful combination of sterotypes that significantly enhance the full-force humor of the series. Few TV comedy shows have ever arrived at the level of Reno 911. When watching Reno 911, you don't just smile, you don't just chuckle, you laugh out loud and in this day and time, "it don't get much better than that." 
This show is one of the funniest on comedy central today. It's full of over-the-top, sick humor that just keeps you laughing through each episode. Definately worth buying the first season on dvd 
This is the first novel of John Grisham and like the movie, it's very strong in characters and dialogue. At the time he wrote it, there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer' movies. "Witness for the Prosecution" comes to mind. And we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like Parker, Crais, Lehane, George, and Grafton. But the legal-mystery novel was uncharted land and Grisham plowed it over with a passion. How was Grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given "evil empire" writers like Len Deighton and John LeCarre fits, eventually the public would tire at lawyers, even laughing at them? Nevertheless, it's a good book and also an excellent movie. If there are drawbacks, then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust. The lawfirm itself for example. Sexual misconduct in a lawfirm? Sure. Misconduct in billing? Always. Stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains? Occasionally. But murdering associates who try to leave? I don't think so. (But it does give Department of Justice cop Ed Harris a great line in the movie, "McDeere, no one has left your firm alive!") The movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it. The lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn, the this time not very grandfatherly Wilfred Brimley, Holly Hunter, always a hoot, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook and Law and Order's Steven Hill, to mention a few. And Tom Cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and Abbey's rainbow has a HAZMAT sticker on it that he's overlooked. Cruise is just great. A true Hitchkockian character, the average man with no where to run. What would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom? That's The Firm. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur 
Nothing can be better than "The Firm" written by John Grisham, who himself is a lawyer. The attentions to details that Grisham manages to pull are just fantastic. I read the book before watching the movie, and hence can compare and tell that the movie has been directed perfectly and in fact a lot more interesting than the book, as the book gets slow in between, but not the movie. Cruise's is superb, so are the other actors in this movie. I don't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios. This is a movie based on a fiction novel, and as rightly said by one of reviewer here;it does its job by entertaining the audiences. 
The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie. Most of us don't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers, and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot. The good guy, Mitch McDeere, wins over evil not only because he's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck. Mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.For example, Mitch's wife gets to know all of a sudden that Gene Hackman's character (who has important documents to copy) is not going to dive as Mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him. Well, good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life. At the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer John Grisham. The movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished. In real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail, even less killed by the good guys; everybody knows this. What not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems. The movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into. Finally, the suspense is well organized. Moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes. Yes, this is very compelling movie to recommend watching. Beware that this movie deals at some degree with the Conservative vs Liberal cultural war. The bad guys had to be the Southern Conservatives who want to rule other people's lives according to their own hypocrite standards. Meanwhile the good guys are Liberals from NE. I wondered how writer John Grisham could portray his own Southern fellows in negative ways. All I guess is that JG realized what would be accepted by the Entertainment industry and wrote according to it. Anyways, this is just a movie and it does what it's supposed to do: to entertain 
This is a smartly written and fast-paced drama. Tom Cruise plays a sharp young Harvard grad lawyer who must use all his skills to out smart the mob. Great supporting help from Gene Hackman and Wilford Brimley is chilling as one of the mob security directors. 
The Firm, it`s a great story, and an amazing movie. i`v read the story, and just now, i watched the movie. it`s great to read the story and then watch its movie, you`ll be able to see what you imagined while reading the book! i recomend the firm to all! and if you can get the book and read it first, it`ll be more fun! Trust me! Enjoy 
I hate lawyers. What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!" Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW? What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment. So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner. Talk about contempt of court. Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't. Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks. Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. Otherwise, case dismissed. JS 
The DvD is great and so was the price. The movie is EXCELLENT!!! Can't stop watching it! 
I read the book and then re-read the book. I saw the movie not once but twice. It is somewhat different from the book. I like Pollock a lot, his movies are so interesting to me that I could'nt wait for the movie to come out. The acting was well done only one flaw. Casting Tom Cruise in this otherwise well developed movie. Everyone else does a great job of acting here. To me though, Tom is miscasted. He seems to be out of place. His thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but He just did'nt click of what Sidney wanted the character to be and do. Sorry Cruise fans he is wasted as far as I am concerned. Gene Hackman, and as well as Ed Harris they did well. A great movie but could have been better without Cruise here 
Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes. It gets stuck or restarts itself. Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
This romantic comedy was charming, funny, and clever. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a problem with heavy British accents. (If you do, try it with captions). It was fun, funny, and a nice pick-me-up when one needs a lift 
If you're looking for exciting chase scenes, gratutious nudity, explicit sex scenes, and formulaic mega-spectacle, then this one is not for you. But, you will love this movie if you love dance, dancers, searchers for true love, cynics whom true love find, oddballs who find their one true soul mate, and good guys who win in the end. All in one underrated and underreviewed masterpiece. Ignore the naysayers. Take a chance and see this one. Share it with someone you love. You will not regret it 
It isn't great drama, but all in all it is interesting. Craig Ferguson is great in it, he even sings. He make the whole film worth watching. 
This was a fun movie! Salsa lovers will relate. New Salsa lovers will really relate 
I love this film (obviously being able to understand the dialogue helps a lot), to me it's the quintessential Brit flick - absolutely what we do best - but I don't consider it a Rom Com at all. It's very bitter sweet, and if all you're seeing is the funny stuff on the surface then you're missing the point of this film. Every character had a dark thread running through them, a secret pain or guilt or just sorrow at wrong turnings made. But it's also about hope, and the message that I get from this film is that no matter what disasters lie in your past, you can always overcome them or redeem yourself. Adrian Lester was, as always, wonderful at the emotional epi-centre of the film. BTW if you ever get the chance to see him do Shakespeare on stage then move heaven and earth to go, he is a sensational actor who absolutely understands how to act 'the beats inbetween'. So, my advice is to look past the tabasco jokes and see the real film 
Hubby and I have finally solved our problem of being unable to understand English accents that are other than what one hears on the BBC and are referred to as "posh" or upperclass. We now turn on the English subtitles and watch them that way. It used to be that fifteen minutes into a movie like this we'd be turning it off because we had such trouble understanding them. With the advent of English subtitles being on all DVDs, those days are over. The film is a relationship film set in London and involves rougly 7 different men and women and their attempts to get together through the use of their local Salsa dance club. Every character in here has relationship problems but they tend to be funny ones. There is minimal contact with the world of divorce and even less with the world of single parenting. Instead, these are all singles trying to connect and flopping fabulously at it most of the time. Each character has his or her own eccentricity which is well handled too. I can't say I need to own this film but for an evening's viewing, it was a lot of fun. There are two men who play cab drivers in a restaurant who have some absolutely hilarious dialogues with one another. They aren't part of the other action but as comedy sketches, their scenes together are gems 
BORN ROMANTIC cuts a slice of life out of London life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types. And it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive. The homing center for these disparate people is a Salsa Club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not, they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue. One woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance, another is a bisexual who fears relationships, another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male. The men are equally edgy, from a Scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman, to a ATM robber, to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch. How they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey. The acting is excellent, the timing first rate, and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the Londoners, just turn on the English subtitles and you won't miss a thing. A lovely film full of surprises 
You know, I normally have no use for romantic comedies--let alone romantic comedies that revolve around quasi-obscure cultural traditions--but this was--I must admit--quite good. This is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual *comedy,* rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs, in spite of not being at all funny. The fact that the characters are, by and large, well-drawn helps too, and including the cab driver (the only one in London, apparently) as a central, unifying figure was a good idea that worked. I cannot help but compare Born Romantic to Sidewalks of New York, a film I hated (two stars was a bit generous, methinks). That film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships, but it got bogged down in its self-satisfied smugness, never allowing the charaters to actually be people. This, on the other hand, does; it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience (of course, it also didn't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either). Recommended 
i just rented this movie without hearing anything about it. i am a lover of foreign flicks to begin with especially anything the bbc films produce. this film combines humor, romance and the energetic salsa music together perfectly. i was intrigued by all of the various characters and felt that they all blended together in perfect harmony. i can't wait to find the soundtrack and keep it for my collection. a great surprise and heartwarming film about romance and love and its many ways 
I first watched this movie because cinamatic legand Joan Crawford was one of the stars in it. Joan plays Amanda Farrow, a rather bossy publishing executive. However, her part is small and the movie has little to do with her character. It's a fine picture, though. At first glance, "The Best of Everything" looks like "9 to 5" meets "The Devil Wears Prada." But after the first twenty minutes I was convinced that this was a much more complicated tale about relationships taking place in the Big Apple. The main plot focused on three clerical workers at the same publishing firm, played by Hope Lange, Diane Baker, and Suzy Parker. Each women has their own trials and tribulations. But I think the one thing that they all have in common is that the men in their lives are all cads. I would say that just about all the men in this film are rather unsympathetic and uncaring. Is this how men really were in the 1950's? I hope not. Normally I'd reserve two maybe three stars for a picture like this. But since it's Joan's "last great picture" (not counting "Baby Jane," of course) it deserves four 
If you're an old movie buff, as I am, I think you will like this one. I have seen it on TV but it is one for the collection. I have watched it twice already since I got it 
An entertaining soap opera, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING succeeds especially because of its brilliant capturing of 1959. The attitude, the fashion, the lifestyle, the vernacular and (both ennervating and bittersweet) the culture. Once you've enjoyed the movie itself, sit back and relish the great commentary track with both the original novel's author and an amusing film historian. You'll get quite a few chuckles along with fascinating facts about everything pertaining to the film and the times and circumstances around which it was made. Wonderful to see so many great stars in all their colorful glory! Also included, a trailer and newsreel. Beautiful trasnfer. A first rate DVD experience 
The architecture, fashion, interior design of post-war America is all right here in 50s NYC. You just can't beat it!! Yeah, it's corny in more places in one but the overall effect is one you don't want to miss 
This 1959 soapy saga does indeed have everything: lecherous old geezers making passes at sweet young things, bitter old hags sleeping with married men, bosses who take their frustrations out on underlings, and sex! sex! sex! Rona Jaffe's bestselling book --- think Peyton Place set in Mdhattan --- tells the tale of three young woman who work in the publishing world of NYC ... modern 9-to-5 gals who dream, dare and damn themselves, while wearing terrific Oscar-nominated clothes that they couldn't afford on a secretary's salary. The cast includes Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Louis Jordan, Diane baker and Stephen Boyd; who better to add extra star power than Joan Crawford as a chain-smoking, orange-haired senior editor who treats her employees the way her lover treats her --- like dirt. Sometimes the best films are the worse. Thank God 
I really miss the genre loosely called "women's pictures" that combined wonderfully lurid storylines (with laugh-inducing Hays Code cleaned-up dialog) and major, MAJOR fashion. Unfortunately nowadays the closest we get is the really crude "Sex and the City" whose scripts leave nothing to the imagination and where the "fashion" comes direct from Walmart."The Best of Everything" scores major points for a great looking cast, dynamite clothes,and wonderfully trashy storylines. If this isn't the ultimate popcorn movie, WHAT IS??!!?? Ladies, invite your friends over, rustle up some major munchies, fire up this DVD and have a WHALE of a GOOD TIME!! 
I remember those days. I used to dress up for work, the high heels and stockings and garter belts, before pantyhose. I like this movie and always try to catch it when it's on TV. I know I'll catch heck for saying this, but I miss those days. During the so called "women's lib" days women were very cruel to other woman who wanted to be married and raise a family. I used to say back to these woman "this is America, we have a choice". Of course I was shouted down so I learned to keep my opinions to myself. Whatever we've gained from "women's lib" (much, much more work, if you ask me and our children are suffering for it)doesn't make up for all we've lost 
There are some wonderful reasons to add the newly released-on-DVD "The Best of Everything" to your film library. For one, it is a glittering and colorful glimpse into New York City circa 1959. Fox certainly has done a commendable job with the DVD--the picture quality and sound are both crystal clear. Cinemascope has rarely been this fun to watch, because now one can see it digitally mastered in widescreen with vivid color photography by Deluxe brought to sparkling life. The film is very, very lush. From the beginning, when the screen fills with a sunny view of the Manhattan skyline to the sounds of Johnny Mathis crooning the Oscar-nominated theme song, you know you are in for grand entertainment. All of the performances are fine, with Crawford a standout. I think it's funny that although Joan Crawford only has five to ten minutes of screen time in "The Best of Everything," her picture is featured very prominently on the back and front covers of the DVD. The casual watcher may never know that the ultimate movie star had a only a supporting role, yet with that tiny role she managed to steal the entire picture and make it her own! That's star power! As enjoyable as the film is, it is incredibly flawed. If one was interested in sexist attitudes (concerning men AND women) and how they have changed since the 1950s, there couldn't be a more relevant movie to watch. It is shocking, and sometimes disturbing, how much attitudes have changed. For example, at one point during the movie, Catherine (played by lovely Hope Lange) is told by David, one of her romantic interests, that once she has proven to herself she can make it in the publishing world (which, in his view, could be the only reason a woman might have some kind of ambition) she should quit it all, get married, and "love happily ever after." Now there is nothing wrong with wanting to be in love happily ever after, but it certainly represents a double-standard. Who would ever tell a man such a thing? Could you imagine Hope Lange telling David that a man's ambition is only him trying to prove himself, and that he should cut it out and love happily ever after? (now I can imagine Joan Crawford saying that to Clark Gable, but there weren't any characters with that kind of will or independence in this film). So much of the dialogue and morality in the film is dated, and some of it is very disturbing, but there are still some good things about the story. There are some great viewpoints on love, and how casual dating and hookups can hurt people, and my favorite line has to be, "Here's to men, with their clean-shaven faces and their dirty little minds." It's funny to say the least! 
Yes, please take me back to 1959, to New York in 1959, or even back to Rio de Janeiro, a couple of years before, where I met Rona Jaffe practically every single night at the then world-famous "Sacha's" nightclub, where Rona was already drafting her novel mentally... When the film started shooting the exteriors in front of the Seagram's building, one could actually walk-up to lovely Suzy Parker and chat with her about how real was the "new morality" of the liberated New York girls in the executive suites, decades before Sex and the City became the post-mortem of the sexual revolution of the Sixties. At night we had the many parties thrown by Negulesco and his charming wife, while Stephen Boyd was being charming to my wife, Brazilian actress Mariza Woodward, featured in LIFE Magazine as one of the most beautiful gals in Rio. Oh, yes, take me back! And if you were not there then, if you were not even born then, do get this DVD and visit New York 1959 and see how charmingly it all started, despite where it eventually ended 
As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories. The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona. This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's. Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960. The people were wonderful to grow up with. This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer. I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD. I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts. Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating 
This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing. I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it. Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again. I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake. This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long. Hidalgo is the name of the horse. So what? That's about as boring as this movie. So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo. I did not, however, like this movie. It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again. If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
Love this movie, caught some of it on TV one week so then did a search on Amazon and brought the movie. Family entertainment Loosly based on the real life Frank T Hopkins who did more to save the wild Mustang than any other 
Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all. Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the "Ocean of Fire" in the 1890's. This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver. The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a "cowboy'. We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke. And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American. This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins. Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world. When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life. Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity. Viggo must have definitely "lived" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them. He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing. Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series. This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance. Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover. 
Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true. `Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon. If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the "Ocean of Fire". Highly Recommended 
The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses. Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies. Not so with Viggo Mortensen. Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney. Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit. Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office. Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it. All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com. In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse. Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race. Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go. The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created. We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc... It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana! During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit. The movie ends on a triumphal note for both. The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals. The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area! My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie. I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up 
In this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of Frank T. Hopkins, Viggo Mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character. Whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether Frank T. Hopkins actually existed is irrelevant. What is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted. Frank T. Hopkins is an accomplished rider. He has been a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army, a Pony Express rider, and he has been in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. Frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile Ocean of Fire, a race that has been held for one thousand years. After the obligatory refusal (all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero) he travels by sea to the Middle East. A side note. The movie begins with the infamous Wounded Knee massacre. The memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts Frank. I will discuss these distractions more later in this review. This movie finally comes into its own when the Ocean of Fire race begins. Several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race. Numerous attempts are made to kill Frank during the race. Of course, Frank manages to survive all these attempts. He also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess, and to save his horse from spikes, big cats, and bullets, not to mention heat, thirst and hunger. Nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining. The title of the movie comes from the mustang named Hidalgo. Hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character. Hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie. Sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie. The only issue I had with this movie was the distractions. I thought the Wounded Knee massacre, while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie, to be a distraction from the race. Even though Frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert, we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were. I also thought the release of the wild mustangs by Frank could have been handled more succinctly, though I admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the Midwest was inspiring. Throwing in all the details about Jazira, the daughter of Sheikh Riyadh (played by the great Omar Sharif) were further distractions. The result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly. I thought Viggo Mortenson was great as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies. He does an equally good job as Frank T. Hopkins. Enjoy the race; enjoy the rescue of the princess; fast forward through the rest. 
I have to say that I really enjoyed this film. It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days. Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed. This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint. If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it. And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him. He is a very good actor and an underated one at that. So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure. And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!! 
Here's an "epic" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia. Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as "The Mummy." Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them. Frankly, I thought the "slow" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did. Another big plus was the cinematography. This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts. Another good point is the language: hardly a swear word. On the negative side, there was the usual political correctness, a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys. The horse race had some credibility problems, too, as "Hidalgo" came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat! Anyway, if you are looking for a modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you and the rest of the family 
This is a very entertaining movie with the horse stealing the show, of course. I also like that it is based on a real person. 
3 stars for the movie, plus a bonus star to the director for being a genius. How you ask? It's all about Paul Walker. Man do I love that guy. Absolute worst actor in Hollywood, but still gets part after part. His acting style is like a piece of wood with constipation. But he's just bad enough to be lovable. People still like him despite his failing, not like Hayden Christenson (Anakin from Star Wars), who just needs to die. Anyways, so the director is sitting and thinking: "Hmmm... Paul Walker's in this movie. How do I distract people from his god awful acting enough so they'll still like it?" Then the answer hits him like a sledge hammer to the head. Get a super ridiculously hot woman to play along side him! Enter Jessica Alba. In a bikini. Think any guy is watching Paul Walker any more? And that handles half the audience at least. Now if that isn't enough, we also have pirates, sharks, mantas, and other sea creatures who consequently get addicted to cocaine, and lots of underwater shots of our illustrious stars diving for treasure / drugs. Also, putting Paul Walker underwater for much of the film erases the need for him to talk. Bonus 
Into The Blue turned out to be a decent movie. I was not expecting a story or ANYTHING from this movie other than pure eye candy. I was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography. The underwater shots are really breathtaking. I also enjoyed the special features on the DVD which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested. Of course, aside from the beautiful underwater photography, there are the movies stars who are some of the most beautiful people in the world. Jessica Alba looks incredible. Ashley Scott is also gorgeous. And for the ladies, there's Paul Walker and Tyson Beckford. I wasn't expecting much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not going to win any Academy Awards, but it is entertaining and fun 
This movie had a better story than I expected, the action was pretty good, and of course, Jessica... 
If you like to be entertained this film is worth renting and if you are a big fan, like I am, of Jessica Alba this film is worth buying. I didn't see this film at the theater, but after renting it, I immeadiately bought it. You can read the other reviews here from the psuedo-critics who pan the film, but the bottom line here is: Was the film entertaining? The answer to that question is yes! The reason why most of us go see a film in the first place is to be entertained, and this film delivers! If you are someone who likes to have fun and likes to be entertained I guarantee you will enjoy this film 
Finally a good remake that is a little different. What makes a movie is the scenery, least my opinion. Scenery was beautiful. But the deep was a classic but the updated version is good for the new age crowd which makes sens 
Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) are a pair of salvagers living a poor but mostly happy existence on the shores of the Bahamas waiting for that day when they'll finally find the sunken treasure ship that will solve all their problems. When Jared's old friend Bryce (Scott Caan) arrives on the island to relax it looks like their dreams will come true when they find the wreckage of the pirate ship Zephyr. Unfortunately, the Zephyr is resting next to the a crashed drug plane carrying 800 kilos of cocaine... cocaine its owner (James Frain) wants back. Into The Blue has Great Acting, Good Directing, Great Special Effects, and Good Writing. Let me start off with saying I definitely prefer Paul Walker not driving fast cars and this film just proves I'm right. The Acting in this film has got to be its strongest point Jessica Alba does another great job in her third movie of 2005 and Paul Walker does a great job as well. Scoot Cann also has a standout performance as the standalone jerk! The Special Effects were probably the second best aspect because since basically all of it was underwater they did a very exceptional job like with the explosions and stuff. The Writing and Directing were also very good but I believe the Acting stood out the most. Overall if you like Jessica Alba or Paul Walker or Underwater Adventures You'll love this movi 
..without jessica alba.let's imagine the same film as "the deep" with jacqueline Bisset...a real sexy looking woman not a " teenager chica lookalike"with very poor acting..It seems the same director had a better choice in "blue crush". The rest is absolutly great and represents a great moment of adventures. buy i 
I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target.... craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation.... The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie. The scenery was indeed spectacular. The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered. Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful. OK, enough of the shallow stuff.... the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick "The Deep" which I enjoyed back then as well. The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc. Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives. Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks? No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day. 
I actually took the kids to see this movie and it was entertaining for the whole family. It had everything for all ages. Family friendly with a lesson for everyone. Being a weekend parent I have to utilise the time with my grommits. Because in a few years they will be turning into their terrible teens. Thats the years they start thinking they know everything. And hanging out with their old man won't be cool anymore. Adam's movies are so family friendly that my kids always enjoy the night outs 
I am a person who mostly avoids mainstream movies due to violence Hollywood messages that don't match up with my values. With that said, I'd have to say this movie was definitely worthwhile. My husband convinced me to take a look I wasn't disappointed. I won't repeat what others have said, but Click forces you to think about your own choices in life. The simple message is this--appreciate people, not things. Maybe that topic makes a lot of folks uncomfortable? Not sure why else people wouldn't like the movie. I say if you want a movie with a positive message don't mind examining your own heart in the process, check it out 
In "Click," Adam Sandler stars as Michael Newman, an overworked, underappreciated architect who's let his job replace his family. Fed up with not receiving his fair share at work and knowing that he's about to lose his family, Newman snaps, decides that his family needs a universal remote just like everybody else and hurries out of his house and into the only store that's open that evening, Bed, Bath, and Beyond. What he finds in the Beyond (Way Beyond) section of the store is Morty (Christopher Walken), a sales clerk who gives him a universal remote that's a tad bit unusual. It controls every facet of his life. He can skip over watching his dog violate a stuffed duck, mute his wife during arguments, and basically bypass any of the ho-hum moments of his life in order to get to the good stuff. Unfortunately, skipping over so much of his life means that Newman misses the small things that make life worth living, and the big things that make life either grand or miserable. In short, this flick is a play on the Christmas classic, "It's A Wonderful Life," with the typical Sandler spin. However, unlike many reviewers have stated, I don't think that the toilet humor that Sandler's accused of using in most of his past films is too distracting in this one. The first half of the film is rather humorous, thanks to a wonderful supporting cast which includes Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, and the breathtaking Kate Beckinsale. David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge also throw in some funny performances. It's the second half of the film that really makes "Click" click. As Sandler's character ages, he begins to realize that he's not that great of a guy. He also comes to find out that there are things in life that seem rather dull until you lose them. Overall, this is a decent flick. It's more deserving of three and a half stars than four, but I'll round up based on the second half of the film. It does drag at times, but it's all worth it. Recommended as a strong rental for casual Sandler fans and a definite purchase for those who love all things Sandler 
Don't watch Click if you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy. The middle of the film is miserable. Of course, it has a Hollywood happy ending. The comedy bits are OK but few and far between. If Click had been marketed as a drama, this would be less of a problem. The story line has some great life lessons. Without giving away too much, the morals of this movie are: 1. put family first; 2. don't wish your life away, but enjoy every minute of it, even the mundane. For driving home those lessons, Click has some value. It is also great to see Adam Sandler do well in a dramatic role. He has more range than you might imagine. But there's something very unsatisfying about watching Click that's not fixed by the sugar-coated ending or the few bits of Sandler-esque pranks and smartass jokes. In short, it's a mediocre film 
It probably won't take the smartest person to realize that my review of a Adam Sandler movie won't be the most unbiased review out there considering my nickname. But much like his other past dumb comedies, Click made into my DVD library. But unlike his previous movies, Sandler doesn't play the lovable loser. Instead he is a fairly successful architect who close to making partner and he already has the girl in the form of Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity) who seems to like to walk around in pajama short shorts and tight fitting shirt. Okay, so not everything is perfect as he is having trouble balancing his family and doing enough at work to be made partner. The pressure culminates when he has to do research on Asian architecture so he can land a prestigious Japanese client only to turn on a remote control car while trying to play a video on the subject. So it's time to a universal remote so he doesn't open his garage door every time he tries to turn on the television. But the only place that is open at the time is Bed, Bath, and Beyond where Sandler has to venture into the Beyond where he runs into the last person you want to meet at the end of a dark hallway, Mr. Cowbell himself, Christopher Walken. As anyone who saw the trailer can figure up, the remote that Walken gives Sandler is truly a universal remote as it gives Sandler the power to control his whole universe. He can fast forward threw fights with his wife, mute annoying people, and pause to kick someone in the crotch without them knowing (hey it's an Adam Sandler movie; you need your prerequisite object to the crotch). No remote control gag goes unused. Well except for close captioning. But anyways. Unfortunately for Sandler the remote comes with Tivo so it starts predicting his habits and starts to fast forwards even when he doesn't want to do so. And unfortunately for us as Sandler goes further in the future, the sappier the movie gets and almost plays out like A Christmas Carol with Walken playing all three ghosts. But luckily there are plenty of fart jokes and other sophomoric gags that you would expect from a Sandler movie that keeps the sappy parts from being unwatchable. Plus Sandler brings in some of his past coworker who knock the comedy out of the park including The Fonz (The Waterboy), Sean Austin (50 First Dates), Terry Crews (The Longest Yard), and of course Rob Schneider who seems to pop up in every of his movie, but you will have to look in the deleted scenes to hear his catchphrase, "You can do it!" The best cameo though goes to James Earl Jones who you will just have to see the movie to see how he is used. But when it comes down to it, if you love Sandler, you will love this movie, but if you're not, you are complete and total tool and need to get a sense of humor 
I had heard that this film was "really funny" and "worth watching". I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan but I am a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken. I was sorely disappointed with this film. The audience can't relate to the main character at first because he is just down right irritating. I was hoping that the gags would get funnier but they didn't. I also found most of the film rather depressing as we watch the main characters life being slowly destroyed around him. Overall Click was ok, Kate Beckinsale looked beautiful as usual but even that was not enough to save it. I would NOT recommend buying this film. 
Everyone is expecting the Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison Adam Sandler of ten years ago. Adam has grown up. The movie actually HAS a great plot, and has some laugh out loud moments. Are you going to be rolling on the floor by the time the movie is over? No. But are you going to get caught up in the story of the movie, and put yourself in his shoes as the plot moves on? Absolutely. It's one of his best movies, and a can't miss 
Acting----------------5 out of 10, Walken gets all 5 points Directing-------------3 out of 10, 3rd movie with Coraci, no more please Location/Scenery------3 out of 10, Bed, Bath and Beyond the only savior Comedy Rating---------4 out of 10, Come on, Sandler will make you laugh atleast a couple of times Quality---------------4 out fo 10, 70 million price-tag and I see grain? Total Score----------19 out of 50, Grade D+ Violence-------------Low, mostly comical, nothing nasty Blood/Gore-----------None Nudity---------------None Sex------------------None Language-------------Medium High, one F'bomb, lots more of the rest Overall--------------Teens will love it, specially the younger ones I have enjoyed many a Adam Sandler movie, Happy Gilmore is still one of the funniest movies ever, and The Waterboy will always be one of my favorite comedies as well, but he sure missed here. If not for the amazing, sensational and hilarious Christopher Walken, this would have been a total bomb. The jokes he makes at Sandler's expense are right-on and it's a shame he wasn't in the movie ALOT more. Sandler over-acts big time, and when he tries to get you to cry for him, well, I'd just about had enough by then. Granted, you will laugh a few times, this is Adam Sandler, and for the most part, the man is a comic genius, I'd just wish he would have made either a comedy or a drama, not both. But what really, and I mean REALLY dragged this movie down was the complete and total waste of one Kate Beckinsale. This is one of the hottest, sexiest, fiery women in film today, and she looked absolutely lost in this. If Selene see's this, she is gonna kick Kate square in the booty for wasting her time with this. Drew Berrymore would have been perfect for the role, and who knows, might have improved it even................a littl 
As the head honcho of [...] I have watched well over 200 reality/political films and give "Why We Fight" my highest recommendation. This needs to be shown on prime time television; if it was it would prompt a thunderous public outcry for badly needed government military reforms. It covers facts that many don't know about the United States, like our penchant for endless involvement in military actions over seas. The film's launching pad is the infamous Eisenhower farewell speech in which he warns America of the growing military industrial complex. Then, in a unique and compelling style it pinpoints famous people, places and moments in time with candid footage and revealing quotes; it also delves into the personal perspectives of a few ordinary citizens affected by Sept. 11 and the resulting occupation of Iraq. It visits key players in government and exposes what really drives the war machine. It looks at military contractors and Congress and their incestuous relationship. It also reveals the much too influential role the so called Think Tanks play in crafting our national policy. In addition the soundtrack features some great musical talent. The information presented in this film is something every American should know, but they don't know it for the most part because the people who want those war wheels turning don't want the people to know what they're doing or why. It seems the war minded even believe the people do not have any need to know. The people beg to differ. "Why We Fight" is on my personal Top Ten Most Important Movies list which is why it would be a great gift. Informing people is the kind of gift really worth giving. 
1. It's extremely elementary. You could read for 10 minutes on Wikipedia, Source Watch, or a Seymour Hersh article and get more substantive information. 2. It's manipulative. The music in particular is far too emotionally leading in a contrived and obvious way. This film does not try to be subtle, like the Thin Blue Line. 3. It's incredibly patronizing towards members of the military and those interested in military technologies or tactics, insinuating they are all white, red-necked, country music-listening, rodeo-watching sheeple. It is certainly true that many of those we get geeky about are not the Incredibles we make them out to be. Hell, I've met fighter pilots and delta force who sounded like red-necked, brainwashed morons, without an original idea in their entire heads, but the film went a bit far with this theme. 4. I had the sense the interviews and sources it is relying on are fairly limited. You see pretty much the same few people over and over again for the entire length of the film. This doesn't give the impression of a wide variety of parallel same-conclusions. 5. This documentary was oddly simplistic in a number of ways and left out many key pieces of information. Its density was lite, considering it is a full length film. This is not an extra-long episode of Frontline. Why wasn't Brazil on the map of covert ops to overthrow democratic governments for corporate purposes? Why did they show the first Gulf War as justifiable and honest? There was at least as much distortion, propaganda, spinning, and out and out psychological warfare PR going on against the American people during Gulf War 1 to show another very clear trend, and "Why We Fight" was interested in trends. It was still quite good, and it's a nice source of on-the-record vomit by neo-cons like Perle and provocateurs like Kristol, both who are currently trying to pretend themselves back into the mainstream by now opposing the policies they pushed so hard for in the first place. I also think the circular referencing back onto the characters, such as the bomb-designer, was well done and moving. So in conclusion, I'm glad I watched it and "Why We Fight" is an excellent primer for those who have no idea what is going on. But it is not a truly great documentary. 
This film should be seen and discussed in classrooms and small gatherings across the country. KMoor 
I can't recall ever seeing a more thoughtful documentary on the most recent of our nation's military efforts. What separates the American experience from that of almost every other "empire" throughout history is the fact that critics of our government are allowed to voice their opposing views. Efforts by some to paint a message like this as anti-American are disengenuous and downright wrong. Beginning with Dwight Eisenhower's farewell address that warned of the danger posed by a military-industrial complex, the filmmakers build an intriguing case of both pros and cons associated with much of American military efforts over the past 50 years. Yes, it has a largely critical view of the quagmire that is the Iraq War, but that's hardly unique these days. Two participants stand out in my mind. One is the retired New York policeman whose response to his son's death in the World Trade Center attack was to request that a bomb be labeled with the name of his son. As time elapsed and information came to light, his view regarding the war changed dramatically. Does he approve of the war now? No! Does he regret his effort to memorialize his son? Still no, although he qualifies that with the notation that he was operating with the information available at that time. Would he do that again? I doubt it. The other noteworthy player in this ensemble is Senator John McCain, who may very well use his participation in this work to woo political moderates should he make a run for the White House in 2008. His expression of his ideas and reactions underscore his basic decency and indepence from the current administration (in marked contrast to some of his more recent efforts to pander to the fundamentalist right wing of the Republican Party). This is an excellent documentary, one that I suspect will easily withstand the test of time and be just as interesting from 10 to 20 years from now 
The film Why We Fight, I believe is nothing more than another movie that looks to criticize America. I felt that the movie, only told one side of the argument, and that side was clearly not pro-America. The film portrays the United States as a power hungry nation, which is looking to create an empire and extend its influence around the world. The film constantly criticizes the decisions of America leaders to engage into foreign combat. The film however, does not present an alternative solution. It fails to take into consideration that America may be acting out of self defense. The film constantly criticizes America for engaging in combat throughout the world. What I have to say to the director of this film is: Is it not alright to defend your nation, after terrorist drive planes into two buildings, killing 3,000 people? Is it not alright to defend your nation against religious zealots, who are looking to destroy your way of life? Is it wrong to attempt to bring freedom and peace to the Middle East, by toppling a murderous dictator? When I see these questions, I have to answer no to all of them. I feel that if America feels threatened, it should not have to seek permission to defend itself. President Bush put it properly I feel when he stated "After the chaos and carnage of September 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers," and "America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people." This film can criticize America and label it as a bully nation, but these terrorist must be brought to justice. President Eisenhower once said, "Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin." As the most powerful nation in the world, it is our duty to spread freedom throughout the world. It is our duty to allow the people of other countries the privilege of enjoying the same rights that we as Americans, sometimes take for granted. Since when, has it become wrong to defend your nation. Why must America be criticized for engaging in conflict, when it feels threatened? Is it not the job of the President of the United States to defend the 300 million people he was elected to represent? Does anybody think for a second that these people would hesitate to attack America again, if they are given the chance? We can never let our guard down. Freedom does not come free. On September 11, 2001 we saw firsthand how evil, those who want to destroy us can be. You can not negotiate with these types of people. The only way to solve this problem and protect ourselves is to act decisively with force. On the morning of the September 11, 2001 attacks, President Bush stated that "Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended." Indeed freedom was and is being defended, and I see nothing wrong with that. Words are not enough to protect our nation. President Theodore Roosevelt said, "Great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind, but great actions speak to all mankind," and our great action, will be to defend this great nation. In the words of President Hoover, "Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity," and it is America's job to ensure that the people of the world have the opportunity to live in freedom. Remember: "Words without actions are the assassins of idealism." Herbert Hoove 
This documentary is absolutely bone-chilling, really providing a powerful and honest look into how war has been waged in the modern era, demonstrating how the American public has been lied to and given propaganda in modern wars, as opposed to just giving them unbiased and truthful information and coverage, and giving the viewer an idea of how war has become more and more about imperialism and neo-Colonialism over time. It was also fascinating to note that the original words in President Eisenhower's great Farewell Address were actually "the military-industrial-congressional complex," but that he changed it so that he wouldn't alienate Congress, whom he'd gotten along pretty well with during his two terms. It's also a surprise to hear such a stinging indictment of military buildup and such a strong warning to exercise military power justly coming from someone who was a 5-star general, a career officer, and a Republican to boot. Sadly, we haven't heeded his wise parting words to us, the same way we haven't paid heed to President Washington's Farewell Address, in which he similarly warned us against getting involved in foreign entanglements and in not abusing our military strength or the nation's great ability to do good instead of evil. I've always thought Eisenhower was a lousy president (though a great general), one of my all-time least-favorite presidents, but my opinion of him was raised a bit after hearing his Farewell Address and finding out his feelings about the dangerous road the military and warfare were taking after WWII, as well as how he was against the dropping of the A-bomb on Japan. However, this film can seem a bit uneven, as compelling and indisputable as the evidence it presents is. Though it claims to trace the evolution of modern warfare and the bloated military buildup since WWII (it's shocking how much the U.S. spends for defence in comparison with all other NATO nations and even enemies like China and Iran), and how the government and media have successfully used propaganda to manipulate public opinion to be pro-war and to not question or protest these actions, a lot of the focus seems to be on the current Iraq war, with some time given over to Vietnam as well. An awful lot of conflicts were glossed over or not even delved into, such as Korea, Bosnia, Kosova, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Laos, Columbia, Guatemala, and Chile. The historical perspective and the film's theme and conclusion would have been even stronger and more compelling had there been equal focus on these other conflicts instead of just brushing them aside in favor of the two that most people already have heard a lot about. Extras include an audio commentary by Col. Lawrence Wilkerson and director Eugene Jarecki, a trailer, previews for other documentaries put out by the same company, extra scenes, television appearances made by Mr. Jarecki, question and answer sessions he held with various groups he spoke to, and extended featurettes telling us more about some of the characters we met. This film can hardly be accused of being anti-military, since many of the people interviewed have either served or are currently serving in the military. I'm a strong pacifist and conscientious objector myself, and I'm not anti-military either. Like the people interviewed, I agree that we need a strong and prepared military for those times when conflict is inevitable, and there are wars which I absolutely feel to have been morally justified, such as WWII and the Civil War, wars it would have been immoral to have not fought. And the military should stay all-volunteer, and be equal opportunity, so that people from the poor and working-class (many of them minorities) won't be so hugely represented in favor of white people from higher socioeconomic brackets, people who have historically been able to get out of serving because of their family's money and connections. The young people like William Solomon who voluntarily go in should know ahead of time what they're getting into, and if they're deployed, know just what they're supposed to be fighting for, instead of being misled and outright lied to by the government. This documentary, in spite of its unevenness, should be required viewing for every concerned citizen out there; maybe then we'll see some change in the military-industrial-congressional complex 
Empire building carries a cost. What will it cost America in the end? It has been noted that there seems to be a pattern where the very recognizition that an empire exists is the beginning of its collapse. May we recognize it for what it is before we have too far to fall. Once again we are haunted by the better angels of our past - men who warned us about the cost of not being vigilant. Too long we have been asleep. At last there is a wakeup call, may we not ignore it 
I'm giving "Why We Fight" 4 stars for its uniqueness and having good intentions, but could have given it a 3 for being somewhat 'dumbed down' and uneven in content. Hours (or days) could be spent analyzing what the film could have been compared to what it is. For starters, WWF spends most of its time concentrating on the current Iraq War and the lies used to sell that war to the US public. It makes a half hearted attempt to give some background of America's tragic history in the Arab world, but never once mentions US long term funding, diplomatic support and the military arming of Israel with US weaponry. Meanwhile, perhaps 20 mins or more is spent listening to a NY father of a son killed on 9/11 explain how he was taken in by the Bush administration's nonsense regarding WMD's and Sadam's fictitious Al-Qaeda connections. This is followed by his later surprise and outrage when he finds that the obviously false pretense is indeed false. The movie doesn't really have the courage to delve into the most contentious (and dangerous) aspects of Why We Fight, but eats up time on a personal story that, while somewhat compelling, is mainly irrelevant. This is what I mean by the 'dumbing down' aspect of the documentary. Another area WWF gets sloppy with is the seeming lumping together of various US actions into one WWF bucket. Bosnia and Kosovo are tossed into the bucket (as red warzone spots on the map) along with everything else, as if all US military actions are the product of rightwing think tanks. And nothing is said regarding US inaction (Rwanda) or the picking and choosing of where/when to let loose with 'Shock Awe'. The level of cold war overreaction (sheer numbers of unconventional US stockpiles) would have helped make the point of the money making business interests in the arms industry, but is never really mentioned. Some of the special features (especially "Ike's Evolution") are more interesting than the edited film in that they give a fuller historical background of how we got here and how a relatively few misguided zealots could find themselves with the military means to actually do the unthinkable... invade Iraq. Since there is so precious little that even attempts to inspect our state of affairs, WWF is worth viewing. But it is nowhere close to the level of documentary skill that a typical PBS Frontline episode has. 
A very good movie, Kiss the Girls, sheds light on a series of disappearances of young girls in North Carolina. There are slight hints of Seven, The Bone Collector, Resurrection, and The Silence of the Lambs so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category, though it is way far removed from that level of gore and horror. Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well! Overall, though not a masterpiece it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment. 
This is a great thriller - simply that - and I was really surprised by it. I don't know why I spurned it when it was out in theatres - maybe because Rosie O'Donnell gave away who the killer was on one of her interviews, and I love her, but WHY give away the big surprise of Whodunit? If I hadn't known who the killer was, I would've been floored during the final act - as it was, it was suspensefully done. Many folks have covered the ligistics of the tale in their reviews, so I won't rehash it here. I'll just say I was really impressed with the acting and the camera work (so cool)! Everyone gives an excellent performance and the pacing of the film is well done. Lots of heart-pounding action! My only beef was with the very ending - I would've liked a little more of a resolution, so I'll probably check out the book to see how James Patterson wraps things up. Good film all in all. Suspenseful 
I recently saw an excellent romantic comedy: Kiss the Girls (1997), starring Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. Freeman stars as Alex Cross, a talented boxing coach who falls breathlessly in love with young physician Kate McTiernan (beautifully played by Ms. Judd). Both Alex and Kate are recovering from messy divorces when they first meet at the Caf Nocturnal, a cozy little dive on the West side of Los Angeles. After a great deal of verbal sparring, they begin to date-and things get hot and heavy real quick! There is an adorable scene in which Freeman and Judd shovel dollops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream into each other's mouths, proving that racial and generational differences are relative and unimportant. The film is about love's magical ability to cross boundaries and contains oodles of on-screen chemistry between Freeman and Judd, notably when the latter gives the former a half-naked back massage. Not to be missed! 
This movie is about a detective Alex Cross who is struggiling to figure out the mind of a serial kidnapper and murderer who goes by the name of Cassanova.This case becomes even more pressing when Cross's neice is taken by Cassanova.Cross's only help of finding Cassanova and rescuing his neice is Cassanova's kidnapping victim : The one that got away. This is a movie with great twists and turns. It stars two great actors Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. The story is great and the ending is unbelieveable 
Hot babes kidnapped,... blah blah blah. This is a spellbinding suspenseful thriller with more than one twist so have an extra bag of popcorn ready for the microwave because your eyes will be glued to the screen. This movie is all about the viewer trying to keep up as the detective negotiates the maze of clues and distractions. MORGAN FREEMAN is the reason I watched this movie. Loved it! Every time there's an "Alex Cross" novel-movie available I watch it. Driving Miss Daisy, Seven, High Crimes, Shawshank Redemption, Glory, Million Dollar Baby, and all those many other movies are excellent, still, Morgan Freeman as the outright leading character are the height of entertainment! Just get all the "Alex Cross Detective" movies starring Morgan Freeman available and watch them four or five times. The movies share titles with novels, but don't let that delay your viewing. An avid reader, I had never heard of James Patterson until I had seen "Kiss The Girls" and "Along Came A Spider". Thus, I had the benefit of not being concerned as to whether the movie script followed the novel to the letter. Who cares?! If they differ, it is most likely because, duh, one is a MOVIE while the other is a BOOK. Reviewers who complain about the differences must not understand that what makes a good chocolate cake doesn't quite make a good chocolate ice cream. To achieve the same flavor, you've got to change some key ingredients. Morgan Freemam MADE the character Alex Cross worth watching. When you need an actor to literally CARRY a movie, you've got to get someone with a reputation for doing the heavy lifting. Freeman has long since done that in "Driving Miss Daisy". Recently, though I don't know why he bothered to do it, unless as a personal favor to his friend Clint Eastwood, Freeman did all the hard work again in "Million Dollar Baby". Come on folks. I like Eastwood as much as anyone, but there's a REASON he's been directing movies and not acting in them for decades now, and "MDB" is a painful example. Hilary Swank? Well, if you get "packaged" between Eastwood's direction and Freeman's acting, cleary people will mistake you for an actress! At least partially reminds me of Driving Miss Daisy. When you search "DVDs" for "Morgan Freeman", it lists 'related searches' as "Denzel Washington", "Mel Gibson", and "Tom Hanks". Those guys are listed as RELATED to Morgan Freeman! You should really see this movie. And also see "ALONG CAME A SPIDER", which I've also reviewed 
This was a very good thriller.Keeps you in suspense all through the movie.As usual Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman gave a superb performance.Buy this movie if like thrillers.You will like it 
I received my purchase quickly and in good condition. It was cheaper than buying it at a store and I had very little waiting time 
On the lines of Wag the Dog, but nowhere near as powerfully satiric/dark, is 15 Minutes. The basic undercurrent of the movie is the theme of media, its influence on people and the kind of perceptions distortions that it can create. Somewhere, at least in the screenplay, there is a bit of lampooning of the USofA, not just the way the media controls people, but also in the aspect of the legal systems - the double jeopardy law the "unable to stand trial" on grounds of insanity and stuff. Having said that, the movie does provide a sharp look into media its effects in one dimension. In the backdrop of this scenario comes yet another strong performance by De Niro Burns. The characters are well fleshed out and played quite well by their cast. The liberal smattering of Czech Russian influences gives the movie an interesting twist. And therein is threaded the plot, two guys coming to the US as tourists and trying to make it rich quick by beating the system. There are elements of the movie which are cliched trite, which tend to take away from a serious theme, but in the interest of 'masala' viewability, I guess these foibles can be passed over and the movie enjoyed well. 15 minutes - definitely worth a watch, slightly violent though 
this is more realistic then some may admit. you see it all the time in the stories on tv, reality is twisted to the point where no one knows what the truth really is, best example is michael jackson. everyone has their opinions and the media is a great tool to use if you have the power to get it on your side. that is what this movie is all about. the movie depicts the evil intentions of 2 immigrants trying to become movie stars by filming their brutal murders. the plot was pretty original. i don't think i have seen any other movie doing this although i may be wrong. it was interesting how they were using the hand held camera video for a lot of the scenes to help with the realism. you can see behind what was being shown on the video he was shooting. there was quite a bit of satire and irony in this movie. almost to the point of overwhelming, but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good cop movie. i would say that this is somewhat similar to the movie paparazzi. storylines are a bit different, but both show how the media changes things around to make the better story. 
The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse. If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...]. If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead 
15 Minutes is a horrifying and gritty peek into the injustice of the American legal system and also the news media. Wow, two digs in one film, how can you resist? Emil Slovak, a Czech National (played by Karel Rodan), and his friend Oleg Razgul, a Russian National (played by Oleg Taktarov), who met in Prague, decide to travel to America, the land of opportunity. Emil wants to hunt down his old crime partner, who took all the money from the robbery he was jailed for, but Oleg is infatuated with American Cinema and wants be a filmmaker. Immediately upon arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a store and they are off to confront Emil's old partner and get their money back. But while Oleg films the event, Emil discovers that his portion of the money was already spent, and he kills his friend and friend's wife. Unfortunately, there was someone else watching the murder. Daphne Handlova had been staying with her friends, and fled the apartment after witnessing the murders. An illegal alien herself, she does not want for the police or the killers to find her, but leaves her purse behind in the apartment where Emil discovers who she is. The apartment is burned to cover the bodies, "A Bohemian Barbeque" says Oleg, which calls in not only successful homicide detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro), but Fire Marshal Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) to the scene. Emil and Oleg get away, but while Emil obsesses with finding Daphne, Oleg obsesses about filming their "Trip to America", killings and all. He believes he is making the greatest movie ever. They begin to watch New York's hot and exploitive news show called "Top Story", anchored by shady newsman/reporter Robert Hawkins (played expertly by Kelsey Grammer). These three men, Flemming, Warsaw, and Hawkins, become irresistible targets to Emil and Oleg, the two Eastern-European psychopaths believing that controlling and taunting these famous men will give them the recognition they desire. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but suffice to say that there is a brutal murder scene where Flemming showcases just how tough a cop he is, and Hawkins will reveal himself as slimiest snake in the media industry, and Emil will learn enough to know that insanity can set him free even if he is caught. There is action from beginning to end in this movie, a tight and somewhat confusing plot at times, some great acting from both the stars and the supporting cast (including a great character played by David Alan Grier). There is seediness and wretchedness and hopelessness, and an ending that makes the film come together quite nicely. If you are ready for a little brutal cop action in your life, give 15 Minutes a try. Enjoy! 
15 Minutes is worth the money. It probably will not be the number one DVD in your collection, but you're sure to go back and watch it from time to time. This film gives an interesting, if not frightening, look at the role mass-media play in our country's daily life. We don't think about it, since we are living it... but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced, 24-hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today. At the center of the movie's plot is a greedy, slick breaking-news style anchor who is given the 'gift' of being the only personality in town to have the near-realtime footage of a string of murders, as they are being committed. He has a moral pause, only for a second, before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world. The rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them. All in all.. not the best movie out there.. but worth the money. 
"The Mothman Prophecies" is one of the most underrated contemporary horror films I've ever seen. I only saw this once and that was awhile ago, but I do remember being amazed that a movie this good could be swept under the rug as it seemingly has been. Richard Gere (yeah, I know) plays a Washington Post reporter named John Klein who loses his wife in a very curious car accident. After the accident which is purposely filmed so that we don't know how or why it really happened, his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures of a moth. She keeps asking Klein if he saw this bird of sorts or not, a kind of Dracula-like figure with two eyes that are too bright to make one comfortable. At first he insists he saw nothing but keeps the pictures, the childlike and chilling images playing a perennial part in the film later on. Will Patton has to be the best actor in this movie. He plays Gordon Smallwood, outwardly a small town nut and actually a man being driven insane by the bizarre enigma that this innocuous little town unknowingly houses. When Klein shows up at Gordon's house (and has a rifle shoved in his face), it is not by accident. Nothing in this movie really is. The way Pellington shoots the scenes of Gordon losing his mind is unforgettable--it happens in a fizzy, weird video game type way which comes off very vividly. I've never liked Laura Linney too much and have always felt she belongs on TV but she does a decent job as Connie Mills, the local sherrif who basically serves as the dramatic witness for Klein's breakdowns as the REAL star of the movie--Indrid Cold--keeps calling him. Only in "The Exorcist" or "Black Christmas", perhaps, have I seen a movie before in which a creepy, otherworldly voice becomes the star. Even when Klein tries to escape his obsession and tear out the jack from the phone, it keeps ringing and ringing. This is an exercise in derangement and a strange form of hope. The climax will strike some as impressive and others as senseless. Bottom line: every horror fan should see this.  
I just read Dirk's "spolier" ending to the Mothman Prophecies and had to say huh? Demonic, fallen angles? What? Did we watch the same movie? If all you go by is the movie, that might be the impression you're left with. But if you've ever looked into the events that happened around Point Pleasant, or any of the books on the subject, you'll see that the Mothman was more UFO related than anything. At same time of the Mothman sightings the Point Pleasant area was in a wave of UFO reports, Men-In-Black, and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky. In fact, Mothman played only a very small part in the drama, it was by far predominately UFO related, as Keel makes clear. Unfortunately, the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely, and so the happenings at Point Pleasant lost their entire frame of reference. If you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened, you might come to the conclusion of the Mothman being evil, demonic, fallen angles, whatever you like. But if you research the incident at all, you'll see you're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie. And if, like Dirk, you thereby think you know all about what Mothman actually was based on just the movie alone, then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a Hollywood writer's imagination and script and nothing more. Mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be. Don't judge by the movie, read the book 
I was scared of the dark after watching this last night! The acting, scenery and special effects were all wonderful. From the very beginning, you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia (sp) of Klein's unravelling life. Is the Mothman real or not? Klein's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics, angels, premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows. OTOH I didnt care for the ending ... too staged. 
The Mothman Prophecies is a throwback to the time when "horror movie" didn't actually mean "Teenage Gore Fest." I guess the word for it now would be 'thriller,' and thrill it does. Based on a true story from Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967, the Mothman takes place in present 2001, or thereabouts. It's the story of a newspaper reporter who finds himself in said town on his way to interview the governor. There he stumbles across several bizarre occurances; namely repeated sightings by the townsfolk of a not-quite-seen ethereal creature, and how these strange tales seem to intertwine with the reporter's own life. The director, Mark Pellington (whose directorial credits include the mediocre movie Arlington Road and the music video of "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam) has created a mood and a tension in film that I don't think has appeared since The Exorcist in 1973. And he does so without blood, gore, or cheap scares. And only a PG-13 rating. Mr. Pellington falls backs on some outdated "tricks" like good acting, excellent cinematography, and an absolutely stunning soundtrack. Close-ups of the actors' faces here convey more real terror than in all the Friday the 13th films combined. The musical score sets the mood from scene 1 to the finale; dark and foreboding, tense and pensive. Sound work this good should have earned an Oscar nomination. The camera work is beyond reproach, as well. Sometimes long shots, setting a mood, sometimes jerky, fuzzy, or distorted like a funhouse mirror, all perfect to what needs to be conveyed - - without giving away too much. The acting, also, is top notch. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton, and Will Grace's Debra Messing all convey a range of emotions not seen in modern day thrillers in sometime. If there is a flaw to the Mothman Prophecies, it's that the townspeople are too quick to tell a stranger of their paranormal experiences. A moments' hesitation, a shifting away of the eyes, the use of a softer-spoken voice in public would have made the stories and the characters come more alive, and added only a minute or two to the films' overall length. Counting Memento, this is the second great film I've seen in the past thirteen months. Get it while you can. * * * * * * * * * * Rating: Solid A + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + F.Y.I.: Although this film is rated only PG-13, it may be too scary or intense for children 15 and under 
"The Mothman Prophecies" is one of those rare films where everything magically 'works' resulting in a magnificent piece of cinematic art. Richard Gere plays John Klein, a journalist for The Washington Post who is trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife. He soon finds himself mysteriously translated to the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He develops a relationship with the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant, played by Laura Linney. They soon learn that many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie moth-like entity, similar to the one Klein's wife saw before she died. Deeper investigation causes Klein to have his own creepy encounters with the strange creature; he becomes convinced that the being exists on a sphere far beyond humanity's finite comprehension and that it can predict impending calamities. In fact, he comes to realize that this "mothman" is trying to warn the small town of one. Can he decipher what specifically the tragedy will be and when it will occure? Can he save his life and his loved ones before it's too late? "The Mothman Prophecies" is not a monster movie, nor is it a mad-slasher horror flick; it's a creepy supernatural/mystery story with loads of mood atmosphere. Every element of this motion picture skillfully works -- acting, story, editing, score, cinimatography, locations, etc. Sensitive viewers will note an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality to the film. The ending is touching in a very powerful way. I'll put it this way, if you appreciated "The Village," you'll love this one. The notable Amazon reviewer Lawrence Bernabo claims that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. This is completely untrue. One must understand that this film is brilliantly intricate. Many questions are raised with varying possible answers. Don't think for a second that there are no real answers in this film; they're all there, but you may have to watch it about four or five times to finally discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have "ears to hear" and be willing to work for them. My initial interpretation was that the mothmen are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humankind by predicting great calamities but can be easily misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell my interpretation was that the "mothman" brought Gere to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the "mothmen" are good in nature. I've come to see that this translation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring. [SPOILER ALERT -- Don't read the following paragraphs unless you want to consider insights into the true nature of the mothmen] The mothmen are in truth evil spirits, fallen angels or demons (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures; these pictures never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather disturbing obviously-malevolent winged-creatures. A mothman (evil spirit) CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)? The bible calls Satan the "prince of the power of the air," hence, his underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus easily manipulate a traffic light or speak through a phone that's not plugged in. They can even take human form, like the male nurse who insists Debra's drawings are of "angels" and then mysteriously vanishes, or mimic the voices of dead loved ones. The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from hell (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin peoples lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human tragedies (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family a respectable social life, etc.). Also consider the fact that they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders. The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for a millenia and therefore see things at least 2 or 3 moves ahead of humans; they naturally use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy. The saved police woman, number "37" (research that number), in the end is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are evil and destructive could now flip-flop into the deception that the they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive. The film powerfully reveals that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are beings whose sole purpose is to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement (not that the movie ever reveals this). For more intriguing insights see Sam Damon Jr.'s outstanding review from October 27, 2002. [END SPOILER ALERT] "Mothman" ranks up there with my all-time favorite movies. 
This is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The success of THE SIXTH SENSE. 
Three problems with this film: 1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary. It's very boring. As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed. 2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging. The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes. Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole. The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting. 3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question. The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?" In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake. Don't waste your life. ALon 
I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed. I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident. The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller. The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based. Very interesting in its own right 
Main Line, Main Line.... those Main Liners.... You like to look at those Main Liners, don't you Ginger... I mean Kitty? You the suffragette who just got offa the suffragette wagon... the same wagon that was seen rolling by in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle... wait a minute... that was the exact same footage! I guess the makers of this fine movie assembled it out of stock footage. In fact Wynn, the MAIN LINER seems to be assembled out of stock footage of Bill Clinton. Did you know allabout the MAIIINNNE LIIIIINNNEEE???? Seems the whole worl knows about the MAIIIIIIINNNNEEE LIIIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEE "Philadelphia Aristocracy" See, in Philadelphia, they're old skool, dig. They even got a Queen of Pennsylvania, who sits on a throne and stuff. Played by Margaret Dumont when she's not getting scandalized by Groucho Marx. And I believe there is a duke and duchess of Bakersfield. And just the other day I had tea and crumpets with the Viscount of Compton. Of the Night Train... I mean Wild I... I mean Yeah, he was drinking Ripple back when Redd Foxx was merely the Duke of Cornwall. He was in line to the throne... or was that waiting for the mens room... See, over here in the States we take our aristocracy just as seriously as our Prussian counterparts. We are always to be seen marching around with those spiky helmets on, saluting the statue of Kaiser Bill's moustache 
"Kitty Foyle" is a provocative depiction of class and gender politics during the era preceding World War II in America. The film bluntly displays how your happiness could be impeded by your station in life and if you are a woman it's that much harder. There are no real villains in the piece other than the archaic mores set down for generations. Interesting, though based on a novel by Christopher Morley, the script was adapted by Dalton Trumbo who would later be blacklisted. Ginger Rogers, in a performance of great strength and nuance, more than earned her Oscar for her work here. Those who would dismiss her as Fred Astaire's dance partner should check out her work in films like "42nd Street" and "Stage Door" 
Editorial Reviews Amazon.com essential video After initially rejecting the role as too sentimental, Ginger Rogers found the title character of Kitty Foyle to be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough. Released in 1940, only a year after her nine-picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Kitty Foyle helped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box-office star. The film portrays a white-collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark (James Craig), a kindly but humble doctor. As soon as she accepts, however, she receives a different proposition, this one from her former love, wealthy socialite Wyn (Dennis Morgan), who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America. Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love. Rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable Kitty, who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status. Did she really deserve the Best Actress Oscar over Bette Davis in The Letter, Joan Fontaine in Rebecca, Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, and Martha Scott in Our Town? Well, evidently Rogers had real-life moxie too. --David Horiuchi Product Description Known for light comedies and her partnership with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940's Oscar spotlight with her Best Actress turn as Kitty, an indomitable working-class girl who endures the rejection of Philadelphia society, makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with Main Line scion Wynnewood Strafford VI (Dennis Morgan) or marriage to a struggling physician (James Craig). Rogers' deserved Academy Award confirmed she was more than a dance star - a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails. Jane Wyman won the Best Actress Academy Award for her sensitive portrayal of Belinda, capturing the girl's affecting isolation, awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph. Directed by Jean Negulesco and co-starring Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead (all four Oscar nominees* for their fine work), Johnny Belinda (nominated for a total 11 Oscars including Best Picture) blends atmosphere, nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classi 
I had heard all the hype about this film and Ginger's Oscar, but after several viewings, I still find the film rather flat as an experience, and Ginger's Oscar is still a mystery. I guess it proves the adage about winning one "For women, play plain or ugly (remember Charlize Theron) or play against type" 
Ginger Rogers was very popular, both within the Hollywood community, and with the moviegoing public. With two strong performances in 1940, she took home the Oscar despite strong competition. Rogers perfectly captured the dilema of every American girl who worked for a living. Her portrayel of a young woman having to decide between a young woman's daydream of what love would be like and the real thing is flawless. Sam Wood directed this very entertaining film based on Christopher Morley's popular book. Ginger is Kitty Foyle, a career girl from Philadelphia who falls for her boss, Wyn Strafford (Dennis Morgan), in what she thinks is everything she's dreamed about all her life. Wood used a snowglobe as a transitional device to Kitty's flashbacks of their romance, just as George Stevens had used a phonograph in Penny Serenade the previous year. Kitty and Wyn are no longer together, their brief marriage ending in divorce when it finally becomes clear to Kitty that her Irish American moxie can not overcome Wyn's old-money family in their Darby Mill--Griscom Street romance. Kitty has moved on and has a chance for something real with a young but poor doctor portrayed by James Craig. But it is a down to earth and more practical love, and when Wyn suddenly appears to take her away once more, but not as his wife, she must decide which path to choose. As she packs to run away with Wyn, she argues with her conscience and remembers. Ernest Cossart is very good as Kitty's pop, trying to steer her in the right direction. He may have been born four drinks below par, as Kitty affectionately teases him, but he is wise enough to see Wyn's weak character, which will never allow him to break from his society family and make a real life with his daughter. Kitty will face two tragedies simultaneously in this warm and sentimental story of an American working girl trying to have it all. Rogers did deserve the Oscar because she is everything in this film. She may have been the only actress around who could have so readily been accepted to represent an entire generation of young women during the 1940's. They viewed her as one of their own, even though the glamour of Hollywood was part of her story as well. She was the American girl made good, and her performance here is flawless. A fine ending showed not only Kitty's Irish American moxie, but her growth and maturity as well. This is a fine film with a terrific performance from Ginger Rogers that is very much a product of the era it was made. A fine score from Roy Webb adds to this gentle story of letting the dream of love go in favor of the real thing. A must own for Ginger's fans and a good one for film buffs to add to their collection 
Ginger won the Oscar for playing this part despite some stiff competition. She's decidedly out of character as a white-collar girl with an old school attitude. I love when she grumbles, "People always make a big deal about the Old West and the brave women of the covered wagons. They don't seem to care as much about their modern-day equivalents, the secretaries--the women of the covered typewriters." With her quivering lower lip and her turned-up chin, she makes us care for Kitty Foyle, a girl from the poor side of the tracks who makes good with the rich playboy Wynnewood Strafford the III, or for short, "Win," played skillfully by the wonderful Dennis Morgan, possibly Hollywood's most under-rated star player of the 1940s. Morgan could sing too but he was best playing men whose love for their leading lady was always tested by some kind of addiction or other handicap, some sort of weakness. Here his Achilles heel is his family and their swanky social position. Gladys Cooper would have a fit if she found out that Dennis was dating Ginger Rogers, and in the book of course, Kitty and Win don't get married but carry on a "back street" sex affair anyhow. Moviegoers even in 1940s were agile enough to read between the lines and to guess that the baby Ginger loses in the movie was a real "love child." You'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel strangle prickles behind your eyes, like tears, when Ginger realizes that she has lost the baby. Luckily Dr. Mark is there to pick up the pieces--James Craig, another very good actor, playing a young intern who loves Kitty even despite the fact that her father's a boozehound and she will never enter the Social Register or Main Line Philly society. I wonder if Grace Kelly ever saw KITTY FOYLE and based some of her choices in men on Kitty's Philadelphia binary. Between this film and BACHELOR MOTHER you would think Ginger Rogers a very maternal figure, but anyone who met her in real life knew that there was no room for children in her heart; in some ways she was a very lonely lady despite her many accomplishments and all the famous men she attracted to her side (think "Lady in the Dark," probably the part she played that was the most like the real life Ginger Rogers.") The subtitle of this movie was "The Natural History of a Woman" and was supposed to provide a quasi-scientific, or sociological, study of class. Far from it, but it's a treat anyhow 
Any best actress oscar winner of 1940 would have been controversial. I think Ginger deserved it as well as any of the others. She is wonderful in this drama, and she portrays KItty with a certain realness. watch her facial expressions. I believe that Ginger had the most expressive and beautiful eyes in hollywood history. after losing her baby in childbirth, kitty's look on her face whenever she sees a child afterwards is devestating. the whole cast is fine, and you could cut Gin and Dennis Morgan's chemistry with a knife. Ginger had a strange power to bring out so much chemistry from all her leading men. In the early scenes, she is adorable as little kitty. I don't believe that this is a soap opera, because the situations are NOT ridiculous and the characters are very real, but nevertheless it is a heavier type of drama, so don't expect a SWING TIME-like experience, and keep the tissues handy. I highly recommend this film, not only for Ginger's performance, but for the movie as a whole 
i had never ever heard about this film, till i found it by chance. i realy liked the sadness that covered the whole film. Val Kilmer is about to become my favourite actor, and i liked the music of the film also. If you haven't see it (and i donn't think you haven't), just dont miss it 
Danny Parker is a meth addict and a snitch for the police as well. He used to be Tom Van Allen, before the death of his wife in an unrelated drug raid near the Salton Sea. From Tom the trumpet player to Danny the addict, Danny's downward spiral has had a purpose. With a single piece of evidence from the murder of his wife, a red hair, Tom/Danny has planned revenge for a long time based on a single vision of a person at a gas station. He intends to trap the red-haired stranger in a quarter-million dollar drug deal with a psycho called Pooh-Bear. I don't want to say much more, which would reveal too much of the plot, but I will say that this film relies on atmosphere, photography, great acting, and visuals rather than script. I felt the script was the weakest part, but the rest of its components compelled me towards its rather predictable ending. It's a bit twisted and unleveled, but in the end that works for the movie rather than against it. Val Kilmar (Willow, Alexander, Wonderland) is good in his role, as he always is, but Vincent D'Onofrio (Men In Black, The Cell) steals the show as Pooh-Bear. D'Onofrio was meant to play the bad parts, evidenced by his ability to carry the movie, 'The Cell', all on his own (Lopez made the movie worse, not better). Peter Sarsgaard (Shattered Glass, The Cell) carries his share of the weight in this flick just as he did with D'Onofrio in The Cell. These two actors obviously work well together. Look for singer Meat Loaf in an almost unrecognizable role as Bo. B.D. Wong (Executive Decision) is at top form as his role of financer/agent Bubba. 'The Salton Sea' is a good movie to flesh out your drug habit, as far as movies go, but I haven't decided whether or not it is worth a purchase yet. Definitely worth a rent, though. Plus, you have to absolutely LOVE that tattoo on Danny! Enjoy! 
This film may be well one the most original, chilling, powerful, potent and gratifying American Noir in years. Frame by frame, this somber portrait about a man who lost his wife in an absurd skirmish, because of both of them were in the wrong place at the wrong moment, will induce him to plan a dark and meticulous vengeance, that will lead him to become a talebearer to get to infiltrate in the underworld and so to gain the deserved trust to get close the expected target. But in the meantime, the journey is hard to be a piece of cake. He will face the dense brume of the nasty jungle of dealers and corrupted officers. But if you, additionally, consider the prodigious angle shots, the overwhelming photography, the surprising information around it, the fine performances and the claustrophobic locations, this sum will compensate by far, all your efforts to get it, rent it and even acquire for your personal collection. A very well made razor edge thriller that will maintain you hold on your seat. 
Starts off slow but makes up for it in the end. It is a really great story. Val Kilmer does a great job (as usual) 
Thanks for the fine actors for supporting this quirky, violent film. Many of them play against type and Vince D. creates an original sadistic dealer. Hopefully no one will try to emulate his sick torturing ways in real life. Basically the story is a mystery and the layers unfold as the story moves along. In many ways it is a conventional mystery but with highly original characters. Kilmer does some of his best work and you have to wonder if his bad boy antics have affected his ability to get roles since he delivers such a great performance. Too bad this is such a litlle known film. It deserves better 
The Salton Sea is a dismal place, and it's metaphor for all the bad that happened in Tom Van Allen's (Val Kilmer) life. It's a modern film noir, and Kilmer does a good job in capturing the torment of a drug addict. Unforgettable characters and a dark glimpse into a world I knew nothing about, except what I've heard on 60 Minutes, and some very black humor. The special features are especially enlightening with (Director) Caruso's commentary. Check it out...if you like independent films you won't be disappointed 
Excellence in story-writing. The script is elusive and well-structured; and the performances were precise. The story is the strength of this film---which is accompanied by the examination of the soul which takes place throughout. Val Kilmer's predicament, which is not completely shown at the beginning of the movie but in retrospect undoubtedly sets the stage for the entire film, is gut-wrenching. I can't express enough the level to which I enjoyed the combination of Kilmer/D'Onofrio/etc...'s performances and the script 
This film reminded me a lot of "Casino" - interesting story, appealing actors, good sets, dialog and costumes - but they also share one more characteristic - they both feature several souless, sadistic characters who perform horrific acts of brutality. The best thing about this movie is Val Kilmer. I think he was in most, if not every scene, and he narrates the story all the way through. I think Kilmer has one of the most expressive voices of American actors working in film today, so hearing him narrate was a treat! He plays a sensitive musician in love with his beautiful, adventurous wife and has the terrible misfortune of watching her being murdered just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now full of grief, he spends his days and nights bluffing his way through a bleak landscape of drug-pushers and drug-users in order to lay a trap for his wife's killer. Jimmy-the-Finn - the angel-faced drug-user who just wants to be liked - is also a great character. His friendship with Kilmer's character is the heart of the movie. Other secondary characters are also good including the gun salesman and the two bad cops. I give this story 4 stars because it is not something I would buy and watch over and over again -- the afore-mentioned souless characters are just too much for a sensitive person to contemplate 
Before shooting the so-so thriller 'Taking Lives' featuring Angelina Jolie, D. J. Caruso gathered talented character actors (or some of them are determined method actors) for this stylish film noir shot in the sunny California. The script is too complicated with flashbacks, but for all its implausible story the film is always entertaining with a clever use of the camera and some interesting (or crazy) characters that you find it funny to see, but you don't want to know personally. Standard film review requires a plot summery, but in 'The Salton Sea' it doesn't work. So I strongly advise that if you like good dialogues and unpredictable story, you should watch it without reading anything about the film including mine. I can also promise some moments of darkly funny humor and strange characters including our hero running away from his demon, plus good acting from Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio (who has no nose) and the moody photography by Amir Mokri ('Don't Say a Word' and 'Taking Lives'). [MINOR SPOILERS ALERT!!!] The film is a noir mystery, which begins with Val Kilmer's character sitting on the floor, playing the trumpet somewhere in the burning house. His languid voiceover tells us about the things in the past, about the days when he was dealing with chemicals. At first the film looks like a Tarantino-style half-comic, half-serious drama about some crime. Crimes are involved, to be sure, but the film soon shows another much darker aspect. The film is partly a revenge story, but its revenge part cannot be revealed here. Apparently, the film suggests, Val Kilmer's character has one aim right ahead of him. He has a huge tatoo on his back; he keeps in touch with two guys who are not always nice to him; and he says he has two names. But his real purpose of life will not be clear until the last 30 minutes. [COMPLICATED STORY] If you dissect all the pages of the script, rearrange the parts, and see the whole thing once again, you will notice that the story itself is very implausible. The film knows it, however, and is self-conscious, even calling its own wrap-up a 'cliche.' But perhaps the mystery is not the point. It's about how to present it, and 'The Salton Sea' succeeds on that score. Its humor is sometimes excessive, or too silly -- see the ridiculous re-enactment scene of 'JFK' -- but good actors are fun to see. Besides Kilmer and D'Onofrio, Adam Goldberg, Luis Guzmn, Deborah Kara Unger, B.D. Wong, Peter Sarsgaard, Doug Hutchison, and Anthony LaPaglia appear, with bits of R. Lee Ermey, Danny Trejo, Meat Loaf. The film is a noir, and like any noir the story is complicated and often implausible. But film is always slick and stylish, and manages to engae the fans of the genre 
We didn't know what to expect from this - our only link to the title was Val Kilmer, who's a favourite actor of ours. We were both pleasantly and disturbingly engaged during the movie - the characters slowly grew on us, especially Vincent D'onofrio's who we remember from Full Metal Jacket. And,it's one of the movies where we couldn't get enough of the Special Features! (We only access Special Features when it's a great movie! 
Richard Donner's "Maverick" probably deserves ample recognition as among the funniest westerns ever made since Mel Brooks's "Blazin' Saddles". Based on the atypical 1960s television western starring James Garner, Mel Gibson does a great job taking over from Garner as the suave, debonair gambler Brett Maverick, en route to the World Series of Poker in Saint Louis, Missouri. He joins forces with a younger, ambitious gambler Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), who is as sly as a fox, older U. S. marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) and a sympathetic Indian pal (Graham Greene). Both Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster are hysterically funny, giving us two of their finest portrayals in their long cinematic careers. Along the way they have to contend with a devious gambler (Alfred Molina) and a whole colorful assortment of other ill-mannered Wild West bad guys (Many of these are portrayed by some legendary actors from the great Hollywood westerns, like James Coburn and Denver Pyle.). Donner does a fine job directing his cast, which apparently had a lot of fun making this film since the chemistry amongst Gibson, Foster and Garner is absolutely superb 
From the director of "Lethal Weapon" and "Superman" and it shows. Really enjoyed this film. Spectacular shots of the West - shot in Yosemite. Mel Gibson is looking old - like early 40s - but his blue eyes and long lashes are still something. He's too comic here, as he has been of late. I much preferred him in "Mrs. Soffell" and "Hamlet". And James Garner was perfect - all cool to Gibson's manic energy. And tons and tons of cameos, from Danny Glover, to Doug McClure, to Robert Fuller. But Gibson was not as smooth as Garner in the original "Maverick", nor in fact did he seem to have the same confidence in himself. The movie was entertaining but gimmicky, from the borrowings from "Lethal Weapon" and "Raiders" to Graham Greene's wisecracking Indian. It was just a little too precious. Gibson should go back to serious stuff. (And look what he does now!) I must admit the ending caught me. I had not a clue. But as a fun movie, it definitely works. James Coburn must be mentioned. He looked great, sounded great, was great. How old is he anyway? Mel Gibson should age so well. And a beautiful old steamboat. Plot was all about poker and money, what else 
This is an excellent movie. I bought it for my husband, but I have to admit I truly enjoy it too. This is one of the best comedic westerns around! It has a great plot that keeps you guessing right up until the end! 
I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character. Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie. This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
This is a western because it takes place in the old west but that is not what this film is all about. It is about laughs. It is a comedy that takes place in the old west. Mel Gibson plays a professional gambler, Brett Maverick, who wants to pit his skills against the best poker players around in a big tournament. The entry fee is 25,000 and the prize is half a million dollars. He has most of his stake and lots of people owe him money but everything seems to go wrong as he tries to collect the money due him, always with hilarious results. As he makes his way towards to tournament, he encounters another gambler, played by Jodie Foster, who also wants to enter the tournament. She too is a bit short of a stake and will stop at nothing to get into the tournament and this includes playing the vamp and the pickpocket. The final main character is the US Marshall played by James Garner. He does not seem interested in playing poker but he is on his way to the tournament as well. He has been hired to provide security. As they make their way to the big event, all three of the protagonists take their shots at the others. The Indians get involved and come across as the funniest, most honest and most intelligent people around. They finally get Maverick his stake (with lots of laughs) and the stage is set for the big tournament. The tournament itself is full of laughs, surprises, twists and turns. It also has a lot of cameo appearances from old time western stars. All of this is fun but the interplay between Gibson, Foster and Garner is the real fun. Get this one for the laughs and then prepare to hold your sides while you bust a gut laughing. 
A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy... When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails). Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford. As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant. But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge... Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try... The DVD Repor 
With a renewed interest of the "Western" genre in 80's 90's(YOUNG GUNS, TOMBSTONE, UNFORGIVEN) and classic tv series being made into films,MAVERICK was a natural. To sum up the film, it is just a plain fun. Richard Donner and Mel Gibson take their collaboration from the LETHAL WEAPON films (and even take Danny Glover along for a hilarious cameo as far as even saying "I'm getting too old for this ----!") to make a very satisfying comedy-adventure-western. Everyone seems to be having a good time in this film and the audience is brought along for the ride. James Garner who originated the roll on tv is brought back as Marshall Zane Cooper. Mel Gibson is perfectly cast in the lead and is so likeable and engaging that no matter what predicament he gets himself into, he's going to get out of it. The plot is mainly Maverick trying to get to, and raise funds for, a poker tournament on a Louisiana steamboat. Along the way he runs into hilarious obstacles and miscreant while meeting up with unsavory charactors etc. Jody Foster on the heels of two major best-actress Oscar wins, plays it light and is surprisingly hilarious as card shark/con artist Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina (SPIDER-MAN 2) shows his versatility once again as bad-guy "Angel", Maverick's arch enemy. Graham Greene is hilarious as the politically incorrect Native American,Joseph who is after the mighty dollar. Also, a who's who of veteran tv and movie character actors appear in the film during the marathon poker tournament making it fun to point them out. Lastly, veteran James Garner is good in everything he does. The closing scenes with Garner Gibson with a surprising revelation is one of the highlights of the film and totally satisfying. Overall, fun, light, entertaining and perfect 
A great movie! What an all star cast! This movie is worth watching over and over again 
PICTURE QUALITY = 4-SOUND QUALITY = 5+The overall picture quality is pleasant and satisfying. Color is nice but pxilazation is very present in the begining of movie. Improves as movie goes on. This being a very senic movie I was not completly happy but still satisfied. Could've been a bit sharper and remastered from high definition but wasnt.The sound quality in Dolby was awesome. Not in Dolby Digital but on a system with Pro Logic II it souded great if not better than most non-digital dolby surround. All surround sounds are present and really stood out. The soundtrack is placed perfectly and surrounds the room. Very happpy with this DVD sound quality.THE MOVIE - *note spolier. The movie was excellent in all entertainment areas if your looking for a FUN Western movie. Comedy, action, stunts, scenery, and many great actors. Everything you would want in a "fun" western film in the old fashioned tradition. Light on violence and good enough for the whole family.*Spoiler - The best (and my favorite) thing about this movie is the fact that James Garner still plays as Maverick even though the audience doesn't know it. Watching it over and knowing that Mel Gibson is playing his role as "the son of Maverick" and James Garner is still the orginal character he played in the past makes this a great movie to watch over and over.My overall review is that it is worth buying and I'd give it 5 stars if the picture was just a touch better. Don't be fooled though, I have a large projection widescreen tv with a progressive component DVD player so I see almost any grain there is if any is present. Overall this DVD was satisfying enough to make me happy I bought it. On any other tv it will display a perfect picture. Sound quality is great on a home theatre sound system.This is a movie that should be made on a Superbit DVD 
I probably own four or five books on the 8 Pieces of Brocade, a Qigong exercise that at first does not appear to be complex or difficult to learn. After reading the various books on this exercise I felt that I had a pretty good grasp of how to do the exercises and what to expect. Watching this DVD was very enlightening and corrected some misconceptions I had about the exercises. The book by Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming is excellent, but as suggested by the author, using the DVD and the book together is a very effective technique for obtaining accurate and effective results while doing this form. The DVD offers both the Sitting and Standing versions of the 8 Pieces of Brocade exercise. Dr. Yang starts off the DVD with a history of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, which was created approximately one thousand years ago. The 8 Pieces of Brocade is presented in two main sections, the sitting version and the standing version. First shown is an analysis of the steps in the sitting version. Throughout this analysis the DVD uses multiple angle shots to display the front, sides and rear of Dr. Yang as he demonstrates each of the movements. Additionally, the added benefit of sound helps the student to realize for example how hard to tap the teeth, or when to breath in and out. Even the tapping of the fingers on the back of the skull during one of the exercises helps the student to do the movement correctly by listening to the sound that is made when Dr. Yang demonstrates the movement. Following a very detailed and clear presentation during the analysis of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, the form is then shown in its entirety. With the convenient chapter markers available on the DVD, the student can easily follow along whatever section they choose. The movement to DVD for the YMAA products has made learning much easier by allowing this convenient and instant access to any part of the material. After the analysis of the sitting form of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, the DVD then presents the analysis of the standing form of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, followed by a continuous demonstration of the form. The student is then treated to a lecture by Dr. Yang on the 8 Pieces of Brocade. This lecture is approximately 50 minutes and has a wealth of information about the form. Clever use of animation helps to illustrate the flow of chi that occurs while doing the form. In my opinion, the way to learn martial arts successfully is to employ the following tools: Instruction from a teacher Studying printed material Visualization in your mind Self practice and study while doing the forms Writing a journal to record what is learned or taught during each lesson Watching videos of the teacher Filming yourself and comparing it to the image you had in your mind of how you were doing the form Socialize and share your knowledge with other students and work on the principles together Try teaching one of the concepts, moves, techniques or applications to a person who has no knowledge of Taijiquan. In the process you will easily learn as much as the person you are trying to teach. This DVD is one of the above mentioned tools, and a wonderful addition for the serious student to learn and practice properly the 8 Pieces of Brocade. 
This DVD lives up to its promises - it introduces you to the world of Qigong. I have personally practised some Qigong exercises before - from some books - but after watching this DVD I realized that I was doing them somewhat wrong. I didn't see any of what I had been practising in this video, however, doing Qigong is like a poem (actually, it was a poem for ancient Chinese), like a moving meditation, it's soft and smooth, whereas I had a rigid and strict execution. This DVD presents two sets of exercises - sitting (on a bed, let's say) for elderly and weak people, and standing - for everyone else. There is a track presenting the history of Qigong, specifically this set, and detailed explanations of each exercise, including medical benefits (e.g. what internal organ you would be massaging by doing them). Granted, you need more information (e.g.on breathing - it is only briefly touched), but then again, a beginner could only get so much or else (s)he becomes scared of so many new things. Still, Dr. Yang has a book with the same title, I've ordered and received mine (but haven't started reading it yet), that should explain more things. The book and the video complement each other - the former has more information, but the latter shows you the execution. Get them both. I'm also a beginner, and have no teacher, but apparently, looking at customer reviews for Qigong beginners, this is the course path that I recommend (that is what I am going to order and study, even if I get a teacher in the meantime): - Stick to 8 Pieces of Brocade until you execute it well, and by that I mean not only physical execution - which you will probably get soon, it's very simple, but also mental - you master it when you are able to focus on it from beginning to end, or sort of. - Get "Chi Kung: The Way of healing" by Master Lam Kam Chuen, those exercises should prepare you for the next stage - Get "Chi Kung: The Way of energy" by Master Lam Kam Chuen and "Opening the energy gates of your body" by Bruce Frantzis Kumar, those books complement each other. Note that apparently all the exercise in "Way of healing" are actually easier selections from "Way of energy", so don't be surprised. I guess, because of this you could skip the "Way of healing" phase completely. When all the above is done - you should have greatly improved your energetics, but it could take years or even a lifetime without a teacher. You are then ready to study Dr. Yang's other books - I won't write the relevant ones here (although I had started too, but removed the paragraph), by then you should know which they are, they don't belong in this beginner's review. Anyway, at that stage you should probably get a teacher. In short, this is a nice beginner's introduction, short of having a teacher. Did I mention to get a teacher 
I highly reccommend this DVD for interested beginners and experienced Martial Arts practitioners alike who wish to learn a set of Qigong exercises designed to improve health. The DVD is thoughtfully produced and has a lot of interesting background and historical information. A novice will be able to learn a complete set of breathing and movement exercises in a very short time 
I have had this a while, but haven't used it since it's so easy, it's boring. Therefore, I only use it when I'm not feeling well. Recently I had a severe allergic reaction used this. I have been using herbs acupuncture, but I really felt so much better faster using this to build up my energy. Even when I was very dizzy felt horrible, I went very slowly on the standing exercises felt much better after, more energy deep down was able to fall asleep faster then I had in days. The sitting ones are even more easy for those who cannot stand. In the demonstration/how-to area, there is an English or American narrator while they show a clip of Dr. Yang doing the exercises a few times. In another section, the practice is Dr. Yang shows you the complete exercises about 3-20x each which only takes about 10-15 min. Unfortunately on mine, in this section, the sound seems to be faster/off by 3-5 full seconds. Like almost all Qi Gong videos, they all say once you start, you must complete it I always do a return to chi motion. There are A LOT of extras. There is a nice amount of lecture about the basics of energy flow how Qi Gong works. This dvd is almost two hours long, so you are getting your money's worth. Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is one man any serious martial artist I have ever talked to knows has read about. There are trailers on his site at ymaa 
The DVD is a more expensive than it should be, but it is very thorough. I like doing the 18-minute standing sequence with Dr. Yang. It is very relaxing and I feel loosened up 
An excellent DVD for someone to begin practicing qigong. Easy to learn and beautiful to look at, these exercises are the most effective and popular qigong movements for the last 1,000 years. This DVD also has a lot of information on it for someone interested in learning more and going deeper, with a long instructional section with Master Yang, where he explains exactly how and why these qigong exercises work. He goes into great detail explaining the breathing and qi energy, with specific instruction on many skills, such as generating 'guardian qi' to protect your health. His teaching style is very clear and, balanced with evidence from Western medical society and a lot of historical knowledge, this is the most complete qigong video out there. He shows how to do each move in various ways, depending if you are flexible already or not. Clearly, he is experienced with teaching students of all ages and health levels. The subtitles are great, the Glossary of Chinese terms pertaining to Chinese qigong is amazing, and the half hour of trailers for other YMAA Tai Chi and Kung Fu videos is inspiring 
I was introduced to the benefits of Qigong by a good friend a few months ago. I noticed that it had immediate physical benefits. I had been searching for a practice that would help increase my physical energy. This is a wonderful introduction to Qigong for beginners. I bought the video on the recommendations of the reviewers here and have not been disappointed. Plus it is a very reasonable cost compared to the other options. Dr. Yang gives very clear and concise explanations of the theory behind the poses. The exercises are simple to do. I have started with the sitting exercises and am doing them morning and night the past few days. I suffer from chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia and bought this to improve the energy flow in my body. I have been feeling very weak lately due to lack of sleep and stress and found that the poses gave me immediate benefit by taking a layer of pain off my body. I am sleeping better too. I will check back in 3 months to update the benefits. Also it became clear to me from watching the DVD that the problems I am having are energy problems. After doing the exercises I could feel the chi flowing in parts of my body that have been blocked -- namely my feet and arms. I also noticed that my kidneys are extremely sore and probably depleted. I was shocked. These exercises made me more aware of what is really going on in my body. The sitting exercises are great for those who need to take it slow. To the senior gentleman who was upset that Dr. Yang didn't go into modifications. Yes, you are right, but you needn't worry if you can't stretch all the way to your toes. Just stretch as far forward as you can comfortably do. He also says in his analysis that the repetitions are guidelines -- and to do what you can. A great DVD. I can't wait to see how I'm feeling in a few months. The DVD made me realize that I need to renergize my kidney's and I am buying herbal tea and herbs to assist in that process. I for one am tired of exercise that pushes the body past it's limits. This set of poses works with the body that you have now 
As a 15 year practicioner of Tai Chi Chuan this system of QiGong and this DVD in particular is one of the best I have ever seen. It goes into just the right amount of detail and description, is beautifully done and clearly, Dr. Yang is a gifted teacher. I have seen MANY martial art training videos and the quality of this is way above par. This is a beautiful QiGong form that is sure to bring health to anyone who practices daily. It's the real deal! 
I really enjoyed watching this DVD and was suprised at how easy it was to memorize the different positions. I was able to learn so quickly because of the very informative and clear explanations. This DVD is a very high quality production and incredibly informative. After studying it for a week I feel that I know enough about the basics of Chi Kung to teach it to others. It was great to learn more about the history of Chi Kung also. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to quickly learn about the 8 pieces of brocade and how to perform the exercise sets 
I must say that 'Best Laid Plans' is in a league of it's own. I have never seen a movie that took me for the turns this film did, and anyone who says that they guessed the ending is just lying to make their hatred for this movie resonate. This film may not be perfect, and there are some boring scenes as they try to hard to explain the state Nick is in, but the overall plot of this film is one I've never seen done before. From the opening scene in the bar when Reese enters till you find her chained up in the basement and she tells Nick "we're screwed" you start to realize that what you think you know, you don't...and thats the case throughout this entire movie. From the start to the finish you have no clue who's involved in what. When Nick (Nivola) makes the bad choice of stealing some dope with friends and his friends are caught he ends up at the bad end of the gun. He has just a few days to get $15,000 or he's going to be worse than dead...Then his friend Brice (Brolin) moves back and Nick and Lissa (Witherspoon) come up with a plan, only it backfires, and then they find a way out of it, but that plan backfires and before you know it their back where they started, litterally. THis movie, for all it's twists and turns and ORIGINALITY, while not being perfect still is a recomended film for anyone who wants to see something fresh and different than the normal popcorn munching drama. 4 1/2 stars 
see this it will shock you move you thrill you excite you chill you freak you out it's one amazing, strange movie it really takes a while to understand it at times but it has many valuable lessons one can learn Witherspoons performance is shattering and remarkable among other things. a great movie. will be seen more times then I can count the next times I play it in my playe 
At first glance this would appear to be a VERY serious movie. The opening 1/2 hour or so reminded me of the movie BODY SHOTS, which is a rather disturbing film. What is most intriguing about this story is that it is a complete farce and the movie seems to change colors like some sort of a chameleon. What you end up with is something totally different than what you think you're getting in the beginning. Reese Witherspoon stars once again as a sort-of young girl lost type persona. She seems to be somewhat typecast for this type of role as in many ways her character is not so different from the ones she portrayed in TWILIGHT and FREEWAY. While the present film is not quite as off-the-wall as FREEWAY, it is still pretty far out in left-field. If you're a fan of Reese Witherspoon or films that are on the fringes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this one might be for you. While there are many obvious clues during the film as to what's going on, I did not take them seriously enough to figure this plotline out before the final revelation. Can you 
This film illistrates the human desire for freedom. A man (Nivola) has fallen in a hole and he needs cash fast. His girfriend (Witherspoon) goes to the extremes to dig him out. This is Witherspoons finest role yet. She takes you deep inside her characters mind and shows how love and compassion direct the character through her toughest decisions. Lissa (witherspoon) and her boyfriend (Nivola) need to get out of this town- find out what they will do to do so 
Great film. Ted Griffin's script is far more powerfull than , say, 'The Usual Suspects'--A fun film with a fun plot twist--but that's a box office handicap. A powerfull story can be powerfully disturbing . . . We can be frightened by the bigger than life bad guy 'Keesyer Sosa' in "Suspects" with complete detatchment. After all, what are the chances this crazed monster is going to blow up your house? It's like watching Dracula. It's fun to be scared precisely because we don't believe in vampires. But in 'The Best Laid Plans ' No boats explode, no running gun battles ensue and we are firmly in America, not Transylvania. Where, to permit myself an understatement, sometimes there's a problem with money . . . So if you were truly desperate, how far would you go to save your skin? Ask the woman you love to have sex with a patsy you can blackmail? Sell out a friend to The Allmighty Dollar? (Wonderfully used by the writer in the metaphor of a rare bill worth a fortune) I mean if your life was on the line with the mob at your heels and the clock was running out, the honorable thing for you to do would be . . ? The hero falls short of heroics here---no wonder they couldn't get a name star to play the male lead--what would his fans think? It's odd how citics are fond of cliche statements about film noir being a genre that 'exposes the dark underside of our culture'--but when a film truly does so with uncompromising brilliance, it's apparently time to back down and go on the scary ride at the amusement park instead. Or make yet another remake of Dracula. Pity. A stylish and suspenseful film. A+ Film Noir 
I have watched Sesame Street all my life. I enjoyed it immensly when I was a wee lad in the early eighties, and throughout my life watching it with little cousins and whatnot. Since my baby son has become able to watch the show, I started a few months back collecting various DVD's. Lets face it, Sesame Street is the ONLY show for kids that I can enjoy as much as the kids. Its hillarious- even the new ones are pretty good. BUT this DVD is gold. Stuffed with the bits and sketches that are harder to find... (although the show does still make an effort to work in some of these oldies on the regular which I must applaud) ... these are the ones that I was looking for in the first place. The ones that I watched when I was a kid... However, some of the stuff in this disc are even a little strange to me, since they were retired before I was born. Most noticeable is the early Big Bird, who seems to be a little autistic, I'm not sure. Also, the first three seasons had a different guy playing the role of Gordon. Other than that pretty much all the adult characters are the same... Mr. Hooper was before my time, but I had heard of him plenty of times.. and Maria! Wow, she was like seventeen when this show started... she was a fox! ... Hola means hello, Maria... Anyway, I cant wait to get down with my two year old and watch the entire seven hours of this thing. Old School Sesame Street RULES!!! Its funny, its got a real laid back chill groove, that is great for calming down the kids a bit.. And YES, still way more educational than about 90 percent of what I see on PBS these days 
There is a disclaimer on this set that warns that the material presented in this dvd may not meet the educational needs of today's children. My advice is to IGNORE this ridiculous warning. The material presented on this dvd is some of the best work Sesame Street ever produced. Sure some of its dated, but what a perfect opportunity to talk to your kids about history,culture, and all sorts of things. I really loved this DVD. It brought back many happy memories of watching the show and I was surprised as to how many skits I remembered. This is a definate Muppet must -have,along with the Muppet Show,Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,Muppet Family Christmas, and the first three Muppet movies 
In the evenings my young son and I sit down to eat dinner in front of the TV set (yes, I know it's bad parenting to plop a kid in front of a TV at mealtime) and usually "Sesame Street" is what we are watching. Like most pre-schoolers, he enjoys the Muppet characters, the humorous plotlines and hopefully he's getting something educational out of it. But as 42 year old Dad, who was a child of the '60s and has sweet rose colored, nostalgic memories of growing up in the '70s, it just seems like something is missing from what I remember. Now, I don't want to bash the current show. For my money it's still the best educational programming for Pre-schoolers on the tube today. But had I outgrown it? Or is the Elmo/Mr. Noodle version of the show, somehow different? Well, recently I got my answer, when I gave my son the newly released DVD boxset, "Sesame Street, Old School (1969-1974)" for his fifth birthday. (O.K., who am kidding? I was actually buying it for myself.) Once, I put these discs on and the opening credits started, it was like a powerful wave of nostalgia ran over me.I instantly started singing the bouncey, unforgettable theme song and as the show's opening rolled by, I started recognizing the mostly urban, kids (and the seal) that had been indelibly etched in my mind (my favorite is the pensive little girl on the tricycle). Watching these early episodes on disc makes me realize just how how revolutionary, energetic, imaginative and well written this show really was in it's early years. I love the amazing animation segments, that taught numbers and the alphabet with humor and just a touch of pychedelia. Early versions of the Muppet characters are there, including Big Bird (with a smaller head), Bert Ernie, Oscar the Grouch (he's Orange!) and of course Kermit the Frog (this amazed my son, who only knew the green one through movies and "The Muppet Show" DVDs). The original multi-ethnic, friendly cast of humans are also all there, which included Gordon, Susan, Bob, Mr. Hooper, Luis and more. I love the ideal of hanging out with these folks! The shows are a treasure trove of '70s nostalgia. I love looking at the clothes including bell bottoms, flower shirts with huge collars and mini skirts. The actors (including the kids) all have either Vietnam-era long hair or those far-out afros. I also love the show's soundtrack, which makes ample use of both Jazz and '70s style Funk. Also, throughout the episodes are cameos from younger versions of Carol Burnett, Bill Cosby, Jackie Robinson, Lena Horne, James Earl Jones and the late, Johnny Cash. The DVD boxset is made up of three discs, which contain the season premieres of the first 5 seasons. It interesting to see the show evolving and becoming more polished as time goes by. Also included are 45 bonus segments (including my favorite tunes "Rubber Duckie" and "Being Green"). The extras also include the original "pitch reel" use to sell the show to broadcasters. The DVD picture sound mastering is well done. I've seen a number of videotaped shows from that era, now appearing on DVD, that don't look half as good. If I had but one complaint, it's about a warning thats put on the first disc, which says "these early Sesame Street episodes are intended for grownups and may not suit the needs of today's preschool children". Where did they get that from? My preschooler was absolutely engrossed in these episodes. He smiled and laughed as he counted and read along with the segments. One farm episode in particular got the two of us into a long conversation about milking cows (hey, its important to a 5 year old!). This really is wonderful DVD boxset, which chronicles the early years of a show, that revolutionized children's television. It is both fun and entertaining. Hopefully, the fact, that there is a Volume 1 on the box means there is more to come! I highly recomend it for both nostalgic adults and their young children. Don't wait, just buy it 
Rather than go with the traditional "box set-by-season" release schedule, the producers have taken the far more digestible and appealing approach of selecting highlight episodes from the show's first five seasons. This makes for a wonderful viewing experience for 30-somethings feeling nostalgic for their childhoods. To be honest, most people wouldn't want to sit through an entire season's worth, anyway. The "greatest hits"/"classic clips" approach is far more palatable. While the Muppets are undeniably cute, this is a package that is squarely aimed at adults. There is an interesting disclaimer in the booklet as well as an animated introduction on disc 1 that explains how teaching methods have changed dramatically in the last 30 years, and that some components and ideas are no longer necessarily suitable for today's young audiences to watch on their own. For example, in the first episode, Gordon is walking alone with one of his newly-arrived young students after school and giving her a tour of Sesame Street. His wife invites the little girl to come over later for milk and cookies, and she accepts immediately. Her parents are nowhere to be seen, and are never consulted. In another episode, a little lost girl uses a dime to call home for help, but a well-meaning SuperGrover forcibly carries her away, ostensibly to save her mom the trip. And of course, there's the issue of the grownups not believing Big Bird even though he's telling the truth about the Snuffleupagus. Disc 1 also contains the original 30 minute pitch reel that the Children's Television Workshop designed for Public Broadcasting Stations to consider the show. Introduced by CTW founding member Joyce Ganz Cooney, the reel features Rowlf the Dog explaining the show concept (creating "commercials" for letters and numbers) to Kermit by showing test clips and footage of development meetings. It's absolutely fascinating (and genuinely heart-warming) to see the people involved in pioneering what was an exciting and new learning medium. You see footage of a cartoon ("The Letter J") being pitched, developed, animated, recorded, and tested on kids. It's a remarkable process that makes you appreciate the hard work and true heart that goes into creating something positive for children. The footage interspersed with Muppet "producers" trying to come up with a name for this wonderful new show... There are five episodes spread across three discs, one from each year between 1969-1974 (including the pilot). Each episode can be viewed as originally broadcast, or you can jump directly to a certain skit. The discs also contain separate sections that contain highlights from each season as a whole, so you can revisit hilarious classics like "Ernie Counts Sheep", "Grover's Restaurant", "Sesame Street News: Rapunzel", trippy cartoons like "Loaf of Bread, Container of Milk, and Stick of Butter", "Alligator King", "The Pinball Song", and great songs like "Bein' Green", "Rubber Duckie", "C Is For Cookie", and "I Love Trash". There are also remarkable celebrity appearances, with Bill Cosby, Jackie Robinson, James Earl Jones, Lou Rawls and Carol Burnett counting or reciting the alphabet. It's also interesting to see our favorite characters before they were fully developed: Big Bird is initially presented as an extraordinarily simple-minded goofy character and Oscar is a strange nuclear orange. The booklet is packed full of information on the behind-the-scenes process and includes a mini-almanac to help put things in perspective (when Sesame Street debuted, the average median income was less than $9000!). There's a mini-pullout puzzle section aimed at children, but I can't see too many kids actually bothering with it. Plus, the grownups won't want to tear up their booklet! If you're feeling reflective and want to revisit pre-Elmo Sesame Street, this is an essential purchase that gives you the nostalgia fix you need without wearing out its welcome 
I was born in 1961. I was born before Sesame St. in 1969. That's when the first time PBS had Sesame St. This before Embo or baby bear. I have watch it when my little sister Gail was born. I had the cookie moster pupput. I don't have any more. We also had LP record of Sesame St. This before the CD's came out. 
It's about time these things went on DVD. The classic episodes are great. I don't have Noggin, so up until now I had to resort to YouTube to see them. I bought the DVDs to watch with my two-year old daughter - even though they don't have Elmo in them, she likes the other characters too. I might not show her the first episode (it's pretty trippy), but it was great watching how it all got started. The pitch film was very funny - it's a lot more like the Muppet Show, rather than Sesame Street. I hope they release a Vol. 2 soon 
I've been waiting for this for years! I'm so excited that I will finally be able to show my five-year-old son all of the wonderful characters I remember from my childhood. Now if only they would come out with Mr. Rogers on DVD.. 
I was SO. EXCITED. for this release when I heard about it. I ran right over and pre-purchased it and waited with bated breath for it to arrive. When I put it in to watch it, well, I was a little sad. I had somehow convinced myself that I was getting ALL the episodes for the seasons, which is silly given that it was 5x a week. But still, you can't reverse yourself once you get an idea like that in your head, so color me disappointed. TBS, what is included is great. I'm sad to say DD is unimpressed, but that's because she's jaded. I'll work on her. They note at the start that it's for adults and not "today's preschoolers" which is odd to me. It's Sesame Street! It's always been for preschoolers. Are ours somehow more advanced than we were?? 
Also available in a VHS format ($19.95), Hip Hop For Kids: Pop! Lock!

Great Work-out! I loved the performances and I learned some new great moves! Highly recommend this dvd 
I'm sure this was a fun video in its time, but the moves are just too 80's 
So glad I ordered early!! My tape just arrived and I can't believe it. I've already owned the first dvd and this isn't even comparable. This dvd has much more instruction and goes form the lowest levels for litte children up to breakin and advanced steps. The crew is much better and this was clearly directed for learning as well as a fun watch. It's worth every penny!!! 
I found this movie to be amazing. You really connected with the characters. This is the type of movie that you either hate it or you love it. I for one loved it. The scene with Lee Grant screaming at the end is a tear jerker. I've seen this movie numberous times and still cry during that scene. I love the closeness he had with his friends and the distance he had with his father. It was very similar to my family and friends. If you like emotional movies, buy it. If your not into the sappy movies, don't buy it. 
Waste of money. Waste of time. Well-known cast. Amateurish direction. Plotless. Politically correct to the point of being stupid. The film's incessant attempts at humor fail. Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film. He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false. It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character. The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant. The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss. Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off. Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments. If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did 
I saw this one in the movie theatre. Since then, it really made an impression on me. Some think it is depressing (my family, specifically). I enjoyed the acting and the premise behind the plot 
A brilliant, but sad movie about the effects of AIDS, both to the patient, and to the family and friends. Eric Roberts, Gregory Harrison, and the rest of the all-star cast were phenomenal. For those who have lost loved ones and friends to this horrific disease, you will definitely be moved to the point of tears, then laughter, then tears again. I thought this was definitely Oscar material. It is right up there with "Philadelphia" in my book 
this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.  
A wonderful movie. Have a box a tissue ready!! Eric Roberts is incredibl 
This movie is my all time favorite movie. The cast is awesome, you really feel the pain and anguish in Amalia (played by Lee Grant) as she struggles to deal with the last day of her son's life. This movie reminds you that its important to never leave issues with others unresolved. I love the way that Randal Kleiser was able to throw humor into a not so humorous situation and not come across as heartless. The movie at times feels a little forced but I can't think of how you can tackle this topic in under two hours. 
This has to be one of the most moving films I have seen! The story involves a man infected with HIV (back in the early days), who decides to end his life when he is diagnosed with AIDS. The character decides to say goodbye to all the special people in his life by throwing a party. This movie will make you laugh and cry at several points throught. As everyone has said, watch it with someone and have lots of kleenex handy 
This movie will make you laugh and cry with a who's who of hollywood. The music alone will move you to the kleenex box. If you have lost someone to aids, this movie will touch you deeply. I was told not to watch this movie alone. Watch it with someone to hug. How right they were. Bronson Pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have. Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples I know. Bravo! Get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect 
The outstanding graphics and animation are typical of any movie from Hayao Miyazaki. The story is entertaining, amusing and touching. I highly recommend this movie which I feel is in the same class as Spirited Away and Totoro 
This isn't as good as Spritied Away or Princess Mononoke. It's not a bad film but it didn't capture me as well as the other films did 
It is wonderously perfect in every way. The artwork is top notch. The story is vivid and alluring. The characters are interersting and develope well. Not as indepth as I would like but it is still well done. This is my favorite movie 
A must see for not only anime lovers but anyone who enjoys beautiful scenic frames and the classic theme of good versus evil. Personally, I liked it better than "Spirited Away" 
I'm not sure what it is about Miyazaki films but for some reason a 21 year old here feels like an 8 year old again. I'm not saying this movie is just for kids or anything but I would highly recommend the movie for any parents out there. Now I went and watched the movie without knowing anything about it and sure i was a bit unsure of the movie at first but Miyazaki won out in the end. Technically the movie is pretty good, the voice overs are pretty decent. If you are one of those people that couldn't stand say dakota fanning and her sister in "My Neighbor Totorro" you have nothing to worry about. I got to give props to Billy Crystal, he does a great job. I really don't know what else to tell you, by now you should just buy it already especially if you are already a Miyazaki fan. If not this one would be a great one to see first. I'd also recommend Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service 
it is an excellant animation and my kids loved it. we all di 
Let me say right away that I enjoyed and appreciated the elements of "Steam Punk" in this film. People who enjoyed "Steam Boy", Neal Stephenson's "The Diamond Age", "The Difference Engine" by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, "The Vision of Escaflowne" animï¿½ series, some of the aspects of the "Warcraft" universe and the Australian award winning animated film "The Mysterious Geographical Adventures of Jasper Morello" will enjoy the general "Steam Punk" feel of Howl's Moving Castle. The story of Sophie is very engaging and beguiling. Howl, to some extent, is a side interest in this film, but then, the men always are in Miyazaki films. It is the power and minds of the women which fascinate Miyazaki, not the men. Miyazaki IS the ultimate feminist film maker. Who else would make a film where the central character is a little old lady? I can't wait for "Tales From Earthsea" and the new Miyazaki film! 
For the most part you already know the story from reading the rest of the reviews and summaries. Someone referred to this as commercial animation and not your traditional animation you would get from Miyazaki and Co. I disagree. Since when has life been simple to just show us or lead us to believe that if you are in love nothing else goes on in the world? To those that are in love I'm sure nothing else would matter. The war itself in this film is almost synonymous with Howl's irresponsibility. The fact that they have chosen to fight without chance of talks and without regard of life from either side is highly irresponsible. In the end Howl learns to not run away and to stand forth. Such is when he is vulnerable but willing to take a chance at giving his heart to someone else. To Sophie. And in the end give chance to make the rest of the world right. I can't think of any other films that really make me feel as much as I do when I watch Miyazaki's films. Howl is no exception. The amazing visuals, the colours, the vibrance, the characters are always memorable, and you fall in love with them always even the bad ones. And the music! You feel as though you are indeed a part of this world and trying hard not to fall out of your seat.  Though the english cast is all star, I myself prefer the Japanese voice actors as they're voices sound great, regardless if you can't understand them. I do believe Billy Crystal was miscast as Calcifer. Watch it with subs first then turn on the dubs. You'll know what I mean. But for the rest, Sophie has a soft, sweet, and beautiful voice, Lauren Bacall plays a wonderfully malicious Witch of the Waste, and Christian Bale plays a decent Howl, though for the mannerisms and dialogue I would expect someone younger to voice him. All in all, it's definitely one of his top films, and possibly my favourite. I still love Chihiro just as much, same with Mononoke, but this will always be sitting right next them in terms of beauty, artistry, and story. Howl's Moving Castle is indeed, quite moving 
I was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and Ghibli Studios previous works. All the greater the disappointment then, when less than half way through, the story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. What a shame. If you have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him. If you are a fan of the book, steer well clear. You're likely to want to poke Miyazaki with a stick and see if his head turns into a turnip or his turnip into a head. 
Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! If you like Miyazaki's work, you will not be disappointed 
80-76%-perfect 75-71%-awsome 70-66%-good 65-61%-poor 60-56%-awful 1. THE HART FOUNDATION vs THE BRITISH BULLDOGS (July-13, 1985): Emanating from Madison Square Garden, this isn't what you would call a classic bout between these 2 great teams, but it is a nice little preview of what they are capable of. The dynamic between the 4 men is perfect, with the Bulldogs struggling to contain the constant double-team maneuvers of their opponents, as well as the strength of The Anvil. DaveyBoy Smith plays the face in peril for most of the match, while the Harts (including Jimmy on the outside with his megaphone) do everything to keep Smith in the ring. I've seen better hot tags to Dynamite (where were the suplexes?), while the action here wasn't as crisp as these guys would usually be. Still a great match, despite the disappointing draw result being called as the MSG curfew came up at the 13 minute mark. These guys easily had an extra 20 minutes in them, if not a lot more. WInners No contest. Match Rating 7.5/10. 2. THE HART FOUNDATION vs THE KILLER BEES (February-17, 1986-Initially, the structure of this match is actually quite a bit different to most Hart Foundation bouts, as The Killer Bees target isolate Neidhart for the first 4 minutes. There's some very good tag-team action here it gets the crowd very much involved. Soon though, the Harts get on top take control of Brunzell for what seems like an eternity. It's a little too long for my liking there are a few too many restholds. Although, it doesn't seem to bore the live crowd in attendance, as they frantically anticipate the hot tag to Blair. It eventually comes it's an understatement to say that the action picks up from there. Blair does everything but get the 3 count as the entertainment picks up tremendously. It was worth the wait I have to conclude that this was a very good match at the end of the day. This was despite the disappointing time limit draw result, even though I had the duration as 19 minutes (not 20. Winners it is a draw. Match Rating 8/10. 3. BRET HART vs RICKY `THE DRAGON' STEAMBOAT (March-8, 1986): Emanating from Boston Garden, this is an early singles match for the Hitman which took place just prior to WrestleMania 2. In true heel form, Bret attacks Steamboat as the bell rings gets the early advantage. But it doesn't last too long, as the tremendously over Dragon takes control rather quickly. Ricky actually is the one to slow the pace down as he targets the left arm of Bret. But here there, especially when or the other is running the ropes, these 2 show the flashes of brilliance ( crispness) that we know they are capable of. As the match settles in, there is some nice back forth action, with Hart probably having the better of the offense (to the surprise of the fans). A referee bump towards the end leads to a short closing sequence where Steamboat reverses a pinning attempt gets the victory at the 15 minute mark. The potential was there to see here as Bret showed great ability to wrestle a 15 minute match all by his lonesome against an over face. Isolated though, you know these 2 could do a lot better as the pace was initially a little too methodical the bout didn't play up to Steamboat's strengths sufficiently. Winner RICKY `THE DRAGON' STEAMBOAT. Match Rating 8.5/10. 4. BRET HART vs `THE MILLION DOLLAR MAN' TED DIBIASE (March-8, 1989- Emanating from Odessa-Texas, this match took place after Bret had turned face started wearing the pink black. It should also be noted that there is no commentary during this bout. Bret gets the explosive start attacks Dibiase as the bell rings, almost sneaking the victory once or twice. Quite entertaining to begin with as the Hitman seemingly has an answer for everything the Million Dollar Man throws at him. But a missed charge by Hart results in him getting winded Dibiase taking control for minutes on end with his interesting mix of strength technical wrestling that became his trademark in the late 80's early 90's (although I personally preferred the slimmer more athletic Dibiase of the early 80's from what I have seen). Back forth from that point onwards, with each man attempting to outdo the other while attempting numerous pinfalls. Despite Dibiase apparently being blown out (his heavy breathing is evident), these 2 somehow stretch the match out to a 16 minute duration, with Bret's superior athleticism helping the match quality out the longer it progresses. This bout that ends in a double countout, is well put together, if not anything super special. Winner double count out. MAtch Rating 8/10. 5. THE HART FOUNDATION vs THE ROCKERS (April-28, 1990-From an episode of `Saturday Nights Main Event', this is a non-stop back forth entertaining match that simply never lets up from the opening bell. It proves the adaptability of The Hart Foundation the potential of The Rockers. These 4 guys just go at it at a blistering pace. Hart Michaels get a good deal of the action which obviously helps, but even Jannetty Neidhart keep the action moving along at a great pace. Terrific stuff not completely ruined by the Double DQ result at only the 9 minute mark, when Demolition run in turn it into a 3 team brawl. WInner double dq. match RAting 8.5/10. 6. THE HART FOUNDATION vs THE NASTY BOYS (WrestleMania 7. March-24, 1991): The Hart Foundation came into this bout as the tag champs without the management of Jimmy Hart, who had since moved over to manage Knobbs Saggs (or Saggy Knob as I used to call them). I must admit that I was never a fan of The Nasty Boys. In fact, they pretty much constantly bored me. Just to prove it, they make Neidhart look like a quick technician here! Thankfully, this is quite well booked in that it uses Bret a lot he pretty much carries the bout. Of course, he ( we) have to put up with the boring Nasty Boys offense in the meantime that brings the match down a peg or 5! The hot tag is eventually made to Neidhart who cleans house. But in a flurry of activity, the Nastys use Jimmy's megaphone escape with the title win after 12 minutes. Not great, but could have been so much worse. Well booked sufficiently entertaining. Winners and new wwe tag team champs THE NASTY BOYS. match Rating 7.5/10. 7. BRET HART vs `MR PERFECT' CURT HENNIG (SummerSlam. August-26, 1991): Great start to this match for Perfect's InterContinental Title, with some crisp entertaining sequences of one-upmanship. Bret's mentioning of Hennig's back injury those first few moments show what might have been if Hennig had stayed injury-free (both then in later years)... Especially when Bret was on the top of his game as WWE Champion. That's not to say that they didn't deliver here, as they well truly did. Just (pardon the pun) perfectly put together, as these 2 guys showed that you could have a great 15+ minute technical match. Great storytelling throughout as both men tried to outdo each other, leading to many exciting nearfalls some great unpredictability. Bret kicked out of the PerfectPlex (which was surprising at the time) went to work on Hennig. But to go with the flow of the entire bout, Perfect fought hard kicked out of many 2 counts. The SharpShooter eventually got the job done though (if a little too quickly anti-climactically) to win the InterContinental Title at the 18 minute mark. Great stuff from these 2 terrific wrestlers, although I'm certain that if timing injury permitted, they could do even better. Winner and new wwe itc champ bret hart. Match Rating 9/10. 8. BRET HART vs `THE BRITISH BULLDOG' DAVEY BOY SMITH (SummerSlam. August-29, 1992 From the SummerSlam that was held in England, this is my favorite match ever. It was very disappointing to see that DaveyBoy Smith's hugely atmospheric ring entrance in front of his home crowd has been edited out of this DVD! Bret enters this main-event match as the InterContinental Champion. The British crowd are rather amazing, and make me wonder why we haven't seen another ppv outside of North America since. Just the perfect mix of everything, these 2 put together an excellent combination of technical, power psychological wrestling. This is arguably the bout that elevated Hart to main-event status gave DaveyBoy Smith a significant push. 26 minutes in length the final 7 or so is better than anything you will ever see. I think Bobby `The Brain' Heenan best summed this up on commentary when he stated "Is there anything they haven't done?" Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 10/10. 9. BRET HART vs BAM BAM BIGELOW (April-24, 1993 This match is from a live event held in Barcelona-Spain comes complete with Spanish commentary (I like the sound of the word "Phenomo" the way they roll their "r's"). Bam Bam's priceless mix of strength athleticism usually works very well with smaller wrestlers, but I'm not 100% certain that technical wrestling is his forte. For the first 8-10 minutes of this bout, he practically dominates targets Bret's back. But it's way too methodically paced only works in batches. A missed headbutt from the top rope gives Bret the chance to quicken the pace, while Bam Bam continues to work on the back. The bout is much more successful at this stage, but ends too quickly at just the 12 minute mark with the Hitman nicely rolling Bam Bam up with a victory roll from a headscissors position for the win. Winner bret Hart/ Match Rating 7.5/10. 10. BRET HART vs `MR PERFECT' CURT HENNIG (King Of The Ring. June-13, 1993): This was the semi-final match of the annual tournament the 2nd of 3 bouts that Bret wrestled on the night. The first couple of minutes of this match is almost identical to their SummerSlam '91 bout, and that's not necessarily a bad thing! This isn't entirely a duplicate of the match from approximately 2 years earlier though, as Hennig controls this bout a little more. Plus, he had obviously since learnt the art of the knife-edge chop from Ric Flair, as he uses it a fair bit. Being picky, the structure psychology of this bout doesn't quite work, as Bret hurts his knee on the outside looks in all sorts of trouble. But then, only a couple of minutes later, he is on the offense working on Hennig's legs! When it finally evens out, Perfect goes for a couple of sleeper-holds, which makes sense for him to recover from his sore leg, but doesn't exactly increase the entertainment aspect of this bout! Then, out of nowhere at the 17 minute mark, Hennig starts to attack Bret's injured hand (from his first match that night)! A great suplex counter to the outside gets the crowd on their feet, and it's quickly followed up by a roll-up reversal at the 19 minute mark to give the victory to Bret. Still a very good match, but wasn't quite right storytelling psychology-wise. Sufficiently different from their 1991 match, but not as good. Winner bret hart. match Rating 8.5/10. 11. BRET HART vs OWEN HART (WrestleMania 10. March-20, 1994 This was a strange feeling as we basically had a main-event opening a huge pay-per-view. Similarly to the match against The British Bulldog, there was a nice family storyline build-up here, although it was probably stronger in this match, as Bret Owen weren't both faces the WWE really spent some time on this feud. Throughout this bout, there was a constant game of one-upmanship (especially on Owen's behalf) that was just so entertaining to watch. In fact, it was so good that you almost couldn't help cheer for some of Owen's bigger moves during the match. They wisely didn't go all out from the very beginning, instead choosing to gradually build up the pace and, for that matter the spots as well, as the match progressed. A turning point occurs at the 13 minute mark when Bret hurts his knee on a dive to the outside. Owen perfectly targets it fortunately keeps the moves (whether for impact or submission) coming at a good pace, rather than slowing the pace down. Nor does it take too long for Bret to make the comeback with a great variety of offense. A nice closing sequence sees a battle of SharpShooters followed by Owen's unpredictable pinfall counter to a victory roll at the 20 minute mark. It's a match that probably doesn't scream out 10 out of 10 to some, but when all is considered (the feud, the storyline, the psychology, the crispness, the pacing, the structure, the entertainment the unpredictability), it's hard to rate it anything else. Both men come out of this match looking supremely good. Winner Owen Hart. Match Rating 10/10. Disk 3 12. BRET HART vs OWEN HART (September-29, 1994 This match from White Plains - New York was televised on some show called `The Action Zone'. It was for Bret's WWE Championship took place after their cage match at SummerSlam (not on this DVD). Doesn't quite have the same impact as their WrestleMania 10 bout (or the cage match for that matter), but it still has some great crisp action, terrific counters reversals and good overall entertainment value. Two edits due to commercial breaks definitely don't help the flow of the bout, but we still get to see 14 minutes of very good footage. Jim `The Anvil' Neidhart gets involved on behalf of Owen, but DaveyBoy Smith negates him eventually pushes Owen off the top rope to enable Bret to get the pinfall win. Hard to rate as it it's a television match that obviously doesn't stack up to the WrestleMania 10 or SummerSlam bouts, but it's still very solid definitely a good watch. Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 8/10. 13. BRET HART vs HAKUSHI (In Your House. May-14, 1995 This was the first of 2 matches on the same night for Bret, as he was to face Jerry `The King' Lawler later on. Hakushi was a pretty good very athletic Japanese wrestler that the WWE brought in for about a year. Following a couple of early communication breakdowns that resulted in some messy looking wrestling, these 2 settled into a rather nice pace. I'm unsure that the bout made great use of Hakushi's unorthodox offense, although we do see a nice Asai Moonsault a couple of other very athletic moves. Not the perfect structure either as I would have preferred more back forth action. I may be a little nit-picky though, as this was still a rather entertaining match, especially towards the end when both men worked very hard to win the fans over. The Hitman gets the win with a victory roll at the 14 minute mark. It actually felt longer than that, which is usually not a good sign, but this was still pretty good. Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 8/10. 14. BRET HART vs KEVIN `DIESEL' NASH (Survivor Series. November-19, 1995): This was a `No Disqualification' match for Diesel's WWE Championship (which he had held for 51 weeks!). The bout starts off predictably with Nash using his superior size strength to overpower The Hitman. In fact, Bret spends basically the first 8 minutes running away from Diesel on the outside... very unsuccessfully, I might add! Bret turns the tide with some biting eye gouging (yep, you read that correctly), and then predictably targets the big mans leg with precision offense. Obviously, this slows the pace of the bout down a little, but not so much that the match ever becomes boring. Bret then has the interesting idea of using a microphone cable to tie Diesel's ankle to the steel ringpost. This leads to multiple chairshots to seemingly have the big man out for the count. But Nash eventually creates enough separation to enable him to untie himself subsequently use that same cable to choke Bret. What follows is some decent, if awkward (due to over-selling), back forth action, highlighted by Hart going through the Spanish Announce Table in a rather simple, yet very effective, spot. A little unbelievably, Bret rolls up Diesel soon after to get the pinfall victory at the 25 minute mark to win the title. Different type of `No DQ' match that provides good variation is quite entertaining. But it doesn't match up to the April '96 `No DQ' match that Diesel had with Shawn Michaels. Winner and new wwe champ bret hart. Match Rating 8.5/10. 15. BRET HART vs 'THE BRITISH BULLDOG' DAVEY BOY SMITH (In Your House. December-17, 1995 This match was for Bret's WWE Championship DaveyBoy Smith had recently turned heel was managed by Jim Cornette. It should also be noted that Bret's sister Diana, who was married to the Bulldog, accompanied Smith to the ring. Nice beginning to this bout, but the Bulldog then drags it down with resthold after resthold. It's not until about the 9 minute mark that Bret thankfully gets in any great sequence of offense (including a nice piledriver). But DaveyBoy regains control after countering a superplex attacking Hart on the outside (including busting him wide open). Back in the ring, the Bulldog gets multiple 2 counts with a piledriver, a vertical suplex, a press slam a diving headbutt. He even throws in a Bow `N' Arrow for good measure! What follows is some good back forth action that is entertaining, despite being a little imperfect not quite meshing successfully. DaveyBoy does hit a nice running powerslam on the outside, but back in the ring he falls victim to a superplex, which leads into many good nearfalls. Bret eventually gets the victory at the 21 minute mark with a rollup (he won a few too many of his big bouts that way!). There are flaws in this match it doesn't compare too well to their SummerSlam '92 bout. But these 2 eventually work so hard here that they win you over. Winner and sdtill wwe champ bret hart. Match Rating 8/10. 16. BRET HART vs `STONE COLD' STEVE AUSTIN (WrestleMania 13. March-23, 1997): This was called a `Submissions Match' which basically meant that you had to win by submission. It also had a 'No Disqualificaion' stipulation attached to it. Making his WWE debut as the referee here was former UFC Champion Ken Shamrock. This was a great feud that began when Stone Cold called out Bret while he was away from the WWE. This resulted in a very good bout at Survivor Series '96 Austin subsequently cheating Hart out of a Royal Rumble win. Hart began the match as a face Austin as a heel, but come the end of the bout, the tables would be turned as this was one of the best booked matches of all time! These 2 are at it before the bell the intensity is top notch. It doesn't take too long before they are into the crowd the last thing on their mind out there is a submission hold! Following a couple of spots involving the steel ring steps, the combatants are back into the ring at the 6 minute mark, at which time Bret precisely targets Austin's knee. A Stone Cold Stunner out of nowhere stems the tide, but Bret everually regains control with a ringpost figure 4 leglock. Back forth it goes as Stone Cold gets back on top with a couple of chairshots. This leads to the first attempted submission hold at the 12 minute mark, as Austin goes for a strange looking armbar followed by a Boston Crab. Back on the outside, Austin gets Irish Whipped into the steel guardrail is busted wide open. Bret then attacks the forehead wound, before heading back to the knee. Despite all this, 'Stone Cold' gets a second wind puts together some intense offense, before trying to choke the Hitman with an extension cord. But the nearby ringbell saves Bret he quickly follows up with the SharpShooter. After almost 2 minutes of struggling to fight out of it, a bloodied Austin passes out referee Shamrock calls for the bell. Any questions as to whether this is a 10 out of 10 match is almost negated by that infamous perfect shot of Austin having blood dripping down his face while attempting to struggle out of the SharpShooter. But it wasn't just the ending that was perfectly booked, it was almost the entire bout. The heated feud really came through, the action was intense, entertaining rather original, plus a tremendous story was told. If anything, it could have lasted a little longer than the 22 minutes that it did, while it also could have possibly had a little more technical wrestling involved considering the participants. But that is very much nitpicking, I can assure you. Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 10/10. 17. BRET HART vs THE UNDERTAKER (One Night Only. September-20, 1997 This ppv was actually a bit of an experiment, as it emanated from Birmingham-England the partially split crowd actually made the bout quite interesting. It was fairly similarly structured to the SummerSlam match which happened a month earlier, but the big difference was that the earlier bout had Shawn Michaels as the Special Guest Referee. Thus, this match lacked a little unpredictability, plus HBK's entertaining antics, in comparison. The bout was natural solid, but over-long. It began with some nice intense moves that were full of impact. The psychology of the bout was ok, as 'Taker targetted the chest of the Hitman with both blows submission moves. In response, Bret predictably targets the phenom's legs. This slows the pace down a fair bit, although the action is sufficiently constant. Towards the end, there are a couple of nice counters to the opponent's finishers. But it all goes on for too long, as Bret retains the title at the 29 minute mark after he gets his neck caught between the middle top ropes, and the referee disqualifies The Undertaker for continuing to attack him. A disappointing ending to a solid match. Winner by dq Bret Hart. Match Rating 8/10. 18. BRET HART vs CHRIS BENOIT (WCW Monday Nitro. October-4, 1999 This was the Owen Hart Tribute Match that took place at the same arena in which Bret's brother lost his life. This bout is almost surreal it really does take a lot of time to both the viewing live audience to get into it. Because of this, I believe that Benoit Hart opened the bout with more of a clinic, than a match. They are very technical very respectful for the first 5 or so minutes. In fact, the first half of it's 23 minute duration (excluding commercial breaks) is a little meandering, but technically proficient. But it's just too difficult to ignore the crispness of the performed moves, as it is superb. It's also great to see Benoit pull out a couple of moves here there that he doesn't do anymore (post neck surgery). From about the 10 minute mark onwards, we see some great counter chain wrestling, as you would expect from these two. And they're both very professional, as the competition aspect of the match does come into play very well. A tough one to rate because of the match circumstances, but definitely very good, despite the strange psychology lack of a cracking pace. Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 8.5/10. Well that raps up another. I would give bret harts dvd a grade of 152.5/180 which is a 85 % which is my higest garde ever which means you need to get this dvd. Great dvd pick this up as soon as u cna. If u could tell me if my review was helpful or not i would appreicate that. Thanks for your time. 
As a Hitman fan growing up I was very excited for this release. It did not disappoint at all! Its a disc that you can watch over and over since there is just so much that he accomplished in his career. Bret was more or less bitter about a lot of things and people in the last few years but he had the class to focus on his career and not on petty grudges. He even goes on to praise Flair for being a great worker even though he had no love for the nature boy. He did not speak ill of Shawn or Vince - and did not want to make Montreal the focus, which I think to many Hitman fans we are very glad! He wanted to show us his career rather than his opinions and that alone deserved a 5 star in my book. I would like to say a few things regarding other reviews here. -Bret did not want Shawn on his DVD - this is simply not true - I read a Bret interview where he said he wanted the iron match but that would mean he had to take off 2-3 other matches and since it was on WM set he decided not to. So please stop with the "he cant accept Shawn" theory. -Second thing is how others did not comment on this disc. WWE already made SCREWED: the Bret Hart Story and Bret watched it. I would assume he was hurt by a few people's comments on it - Hogan, Flair, Lawler, among others. Also I would assume none of the parties involved wanted to switch face and praise him. Plus he did about 7 hours of footage and edited down to 2 hours. I am disappointed not to hear more from his peers but most of that generation does not work for WWE and/or had fallouts with Vince. -Lastly- for those who want to include the "Screwjob". Honestly there is no reason to consider it. It wasnt the best match between the two and the "WWE Ending" was the ringing of the bell and Shawn running out of the ring. I dont know what you people hope to see but that 30 second ending isnt really worth it. They do not show him breaking monitors or punching vince. I felt his match collection was but it did not including anything from his Lawler, Backlund, Yoko feuds. And the whole series of events with Austin couldve been included in more detail as it was so much fun to watch! The matches selected showed how good of a wrestler he is - and NO he does not finish them all off with his finishing move (unlike a lot of others who have DVDs out)! I surely hope WWE can someday release a second set of Bret Hart matches similiar to what they did for the Undertaker. He def have 3 more dvd full of great matches! In the meantime I will be enjoying the collection and relive the memories of Bret the Hitman Hart 
The absolute best is Hitman Hart: Wrestling With Shadows. However, if you want the newest interviews with Bret along with some of the best footage you can see of him from his early Stampede days to WCW, this is the DVD to get! I'm so glad to finally have some excellent matches of his on DVD. My only complaint was the audio on the Hart vs. Austin match for Wrestlemania 13 is off by about 2 seconds which doesn't sound like much but is very noticeable when someone hits the mat and there's no sound until a few seconds later. But it's not enough to drop it down to 4 stars. The tributes to his brothers Owen and Dean as well as other fallen commrades including brother in law Davey Boy Smith, Curt Hennig, Big Boss Man, Rick Rude, Miss Elizabeth and others were touching. They did an excellent job with this DVD despite the fact McMahon had to give a BS statement at the beginning about Bret "putting their differences aside" for the sake of the DVD. It was very obviously another dig by an unscrupulous shyster. If you're looking for the "Montreal Screwjob" match in its entirety on this DVD, you won't find it. It was cut for time (and Bret said he wanted to "de-emphasize" it on this project) but is featured in bits and pieces in the documentary itself. Thankfully Bret hocking on McMahon was shown several times which made me smile after the opening statement by McMahon. Highly recommended 
This is a great set if you are interested in knowing Bret "Hitman" Hart the man. However, the matches leave much to be desired. It seems that Bret focused more on choosing matches that were sentimental to him as opposed to what would be most memorable to fans. Overall, I would still recommend this set because it is a first rate documentary. However, if you want more wrestling and less documentary, you might want to spring for the Undertaker DVD 
This dvd set is truly wonderful and is a must have for every Bret Hart fan. It was long overdue and the dvd set does focus on the postive points of Bret's career 
This three disc set is a must-have for any wrestling fan. The first disc does a great job of telling the story of how he became the hitman and covers the controversy in montreal which forced him to leave wwe as well as his look back on the tragic passing of his brother Owen. The other two discs include most of the hitman's best matches. His match with HBK from wrestlemania 12 was left out probably because bret wanted it left out and maybe since it was a very long match. Some of the matches included are: WM 13 submission match vs. Austin, WM 10 vs. Owen, and his Summerslam '92 match against the British Bulldog. This is a great dvd set that does well with capturing the true essence of why Bret Hart was the Excellence of Execution. I believe this set includes a total of 18 hitman matches which were not only singles matches but also his matches from earlier in his career in tag team action along with Jim the Anvil Niedhart in the Hart Foundation. So this set is just great simply because it is comprehensive in its coverage of Bret's career from early wwe to his days in WCW. Buy this dvd set. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED 
The greatest wrestler to have ever graced a squared circle finally gets to shed light on his legacy. Ever since Survivor Series '97...Bret Hart's career hasn't been labeled with the words "Excellence Of Execution" but with the word "SCREWED" and it's stayed that way for over close to 10 years and would have been kept that way for the rest of his life after the original annoucement that this DVD would be labeled "Screwed: The Bret Hart Story." However, Bret stepped up was able to erase that word from his legacy is replace it with "Best There Is, Best There Was, Best There Ever Will Be" and also made this one of the most "unique" DVD sets in WWE history. The early years of Bret growing up in the Hart household and breaking into his dad's Stampeed Wrestling kick the documentry off. His entrance in to WWE and not really getting off to a good start (Cowboy Bret Hart?) until he finally teamed with Jim Neidhart Jimmy Hart to form the Hart Foundation. The Hart Foundation's dominance over the tag team division as well as Bret's ability to be a heel are glossed over before his road to the Intercontinental Championship and how important that championship was to his career (which is amazing compared to how it's being used in WWE today). His classic matches featuring Roddy Piper (WrestleMania VIII my favorite "Hitman" match), Mr. Perfect British Bulldog (SummerSlam '91 '92) are also looked upon leading up to his first WWE title reign (including highlights from the match with Flair that is rare to find), the impact is had on making him an international superstar, and how he was able to make to have people apprechate wrestling more over than Hulk Hogan's sports entertainment. His fued with his brother Owen is discussed after Bret discusses his disappointment in how his first title reign ended (remember Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania IX?) and how he worked his way back to the title including the King Of The Ring tournament. His disapointment in his third title reign being completely overlooked infavor of Shawn Michaels leading up to his WrestleMania XII Ironman Match. The Ironman match is heavily discussed as Bret talks about how he thought everything (promos, commentary during the match) were in favor of HBK. His return to WWE after his vacation and the heated fued between himself Stone Cold Steve Austin is heavily discussed as well as the respect for one another. Bret's last run which provoked a U.S.A. vs. Canada fued along with the new Hart Foundation is discussed leading up to the Survivor Series. Survivor Series isn't heavily talked about but you get everyone's feelings now after they've had plently of times to reflect on their actions. Bret's disappointing run in WCW is discussed along with Bret's favorite moments including the Owen Hart tribute match. The profile on Bret rounds out with him talking about his stroke and how his life has been for the past few years. DVD extras include interview outtakes where Bret discusses certain issues like the name "The Dungeon", how Konnan taught Bret the Sharpshooter, a funny Owen story where he crankcalled Stu Hart, the story behind his sunglasses, and the whole Hart Family tree. Also Bret pays tribute to his friends in the wrestling business who passed away along with his late brother Dean Hart. Hidden extras were his "You Start The Fire" music video, an old Stampeed Wrestling interview featuring the Bushwackers (then known as the Sheepherders), and interview outtakes feauturing Bret discussing never injuring another wrestler, and where he got the name "Hitman." Earlier I said this was the most unique DVD set in WWE history and that's because instead of following the usual pattern of putting high profile matches (title wins, most memorable matches), Bret picked out his personal favorite matches and most of which are rare and most people didn't know happened or were so low profile that people forget they happened. These type of matches feature Ricky Steamboat, Bam Bam Bigelow, Ted Dibiase, Hakushi, Owen Hart, Undertaker and matches as the Hart Foundation against British Bulldogs, Killer Beez, and The Rockers. Alot of Bret's PPV high profile matches are included featuring himself as the Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation against Nasty Boys (WrestleMania VII), two matches against Mr. Perfect (King Of The Ring '93) including his first Intercontinental Title win (SummerSlam '91), his WrestleMania X match against Owen Hart, his No Holds Barred match against WWE Champion Diesel (Survivor Series '95 the only World Title win on his DVD), British Bulldog (In Your House), the Submission Match from WrestleMania 13 against Steve Austin (the audio is off by at least a second), and the Owen Hart tribute match from WCW Nitro against Chris Benoit. Overall, this is probably one of the best DVD sets that WWE has put out is a fitting tribute to Bret "The Hitman" Hart. 
This dvd in my opinion is by far the best bio dvd done so far. The program part which runs around for a little more than 2 hrs is excellent. The eighteen matches that are on here are excellent. Its just a very well done and well deserved dvd to one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. I think they should have one more dvd cause there is more than enough great matches that didnt make this dvd. Here's what it should look like. Also according to articles ive read Bret recorded more than 7 hrs in interviews and only about 2 and half made the 1st dvd im not saying they have another documentary just some extra interview on the extras part of the dvd. Title: Excellence of Execution This should be like the undertaker dvd where a narrator setups each match. Would Be Prolly 10 Hrs.

The thing that gets me about Bret Everytime is his Sincerity. He always has and always will be a LOVER OF THE SPORT. More than anything else this set delivers, and it delivers all you could want, except maybe Bret beating down on Vince (just a personal fantasy) And you ALMOST get that too! But more than anything - you get tons of good solid, straight up talk from a man who dedicated himself to entertaining a public with something he loved - and was born and raised to do. He's had to endure some awful misfortune - but this guy shows us all how to stand up and fight - and not just for cash. 
I purchased this dvd because I own the 2nd one and like it so much. Boy, was I disappointed! The abs diet people must have decided to create the second dvd because this one needed a good edit. The second dvd covers basically the same exercises but with better instruction and form. Skip this one and buy the Abs Diet Workout 2 
I'm not keen on workout tapes or DVDs but I bought this because I got a deal when I bought the book, too. But this is a great workout DVD with 3 levels, one right for everyone. It doesn't take long to work out with it and the music that accompanies the action really gets you going. I've lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks by using the Abs Diet book (it shouldn't be called a diet - more of a lifestyle change in a positive way that anyone can stick with) and the DVD 
I have dozens of workout videos and I have been religious about this one! I usually just do beginning, intermediate and advanced for one long workout. I disagree that it is only for women, I think it is for men too-but most men I know don't like working out to videos. It is a great video and I have already recommended it to my friends 
This is the perfect DVD companion for the The Abs Diet Book. You eat more frequently, you eat consciously, and you exercise. It works !!! This plan keeps your metabolism at maximum speed all day long. I eat more than I ever ate before, and I have been able to keep in good shape. I was able to lost more than 200 lbs, I have been able to keep in shape for more than two years. I am in the best shape of my life thanks to The ABS Diet. The really important thing for me is not just that I look great, but that I feel great and that I am healthier than ever. Don't take my word, try the ABS diet and I am sure that you will get the results that you expect. Just stay in the plant until it becomes habit. !!! Another tools you may want to consider, to complement The ABS Diet DVD and book with your strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off are: - A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism). - A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism). - "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss", which is another very practical, readable and insightful book, focused on how to boost your metabolism. - "The Hard Body Guide". Excellent strategies, programs and workouts, aimed to increase your muscle mass. 
I was wondering if this really works, because there's dvd's and books that just lie to get MILLIONS! and that bugs me a lot. I was wondering if it actually worked because it's sounds just "too" good. But I have read some positive things from this dvd. I was wondering if anyone out there that owns this could tell me and I would appreciate it. Thanks ;] *And for the 5 stars, I have no idea, so don't listen to that* Please tell me if it really works. okay thanks 
Just got the new DVD in and I love it. I got into a workout rut, got bored and haven't done anything for the past 2 1/2 weeks so when I got this in I was anxious for something new. It's like any typical video but this one actually works you out instead of killing you or being so slow you're finished before they are. Yes, the jokes are kinda cheesy, the ladies in the back aren't using much weight, blah, blah....whatever----I had such a good work out yesterday I can feel it all over, esp my legs. I love how he demonstrates every exercise. And as for some of the reviews saying it wasn't all that, it's like any routine. You have to tweak ANY fitness plan to your level. If you're expecting a "made just for you" workout, hire a personal trainer. The modifications you'd make would be simple. Someone mentioned it was a "women's workout" b/c it has women in it and b/c of the push-ups. Umm, get off your knees, on your toes, and place your hands a little closer together. See, a simple modification. The girls in the video not lifting enough for you? Umm, increase your weight. It's an awesome addition to any workout routine or a great start for those just beginning. I myself will still make my bowflex the foundation of my workouts but I like knowing I have something else I can do when I'm just not feeling the treadmill or weights 
A more apt description of this video would be "The Floozie Workout." If you are a woman and serious about fitness be prepared to be insulted by the two floozies featured with Tom Holland on this exercise video who provide unnecessary comic relief in this otherwise solid weight training workout video. The video is intended to provide a circuit training program to complement the Abs Diet, a diet developed and promoted by David Zinczkenko Editor-in-Chief of Men'sHealth magazine. The diet (details of which I won't elaborate on here) is a solid one and in many respects resembles the Weight Watcher Core program - it emphasizes a balance of protein, healthy fat, and complex carbs eaten in moderate portions. The video provides three tracks - one for the absolute beginner, a second for intermediates and a third for those more advanced. Frankly, the advanced track is not all that advanced. If you are interested in weight training and have no experience (be sure to consult your physician before starting an exercise program), I suggest you start with the beginner circuit. After several weeks when you feel confident, you should be able to tackle the intermediate circuit and shortly thereafter the advanced circuits. If you are looking for a serious weight training workout you should strongly consider Jari Love's "Get Ripped" workout - more rigorous, emphasizes tempo training, and grows with you (many variations demonstrated/discussed other than merely increasing the weight). The video opens with a very short cardio workout and then segues into the beginner's workout. Holland introduces each exercise and then takes the viewer through one set of reps. He is accompanied by two women who carry very light weights and go through the motions. If you truly want to make this a circuit you need to repeat the exercise circuit at least once if not twice. The intermediate and advanced circuits feature the same basic exercises as in the beginner circuit but take it up a "notch" by adding light weight to some exercises and in the advanced doing double duty on others (upper body/lower body). If you are in any kind of shape you will probably benefit the most by combining all three circuits sequentially as cued on the video. The whole workout will take less than one hour. Don't expect abs though. If you want abs you really need to watch your diet - eat really clean - and do some serious core work and this workout just doesn't have it. 
As a professional trainer, my biggest concern is for begginers or sedentary people in search of a safe, appropriate way to get started with an effective program. For these people, there are alot of bad choices out there. But this DVD is perfect for beginners - safe, efficient and not overwhelming - A great way to build a fitness foundation.

I love the Abs Diet itself so I was expecting great things from the workout. It was pretty good, but the moves are nothing new. I was disappointed that the "Advanced Total Body Circuit Training" was actually just 12 squats, 12 lunges, and some push-ups and that was it. Don't get me wrong I felt it the next day, but only after I did the routine twice. The exercises are definitely effective, but they're nothing spectacular or new. Overall it's a great workout, but as you get a little stronger you can expect to have to do the routine more than once or add weight in order for it to be effective. 
I have two of the Prevention Fitness Systems dance videos and they are two of my three favorites. I am familiar with the teachers from earlier Crunch dance work-out videos. I have to work at it a bit to get my heart rate up to where I want it by putting in some extra oomph. But it is do-able and I very much enjoy the routines. They are the right length of time for me too. I have a small amount of workout space and am able to do these in that space. I look forward to my workout with this DVD 
This is one of my best buys of the year by far. Marie Forleo who led Crunch Cardio Dance Blast leads you through this dance workout. She is joined by 4 other ladies, a couple of them I have also seen in Crunch workouts. The are 2-15 minute dance routines, Afro-Latin and Reggae Funk. A warm up and isolations segment precedes the dance workouts and the cool down follows. The warmup is short and sweet, then you move into the isolations or dance basics segment. These moves are designed to increase range of motion, coordination and muscle definition. Some of the moves included her are shoulder rolls, hip circles, the box and more hip shakes. This section is probably not necessary once you master the dance routines, but I find myself doing it anyway because I enjoy it, plus I like the music too. Afro latin is the first dance routine consisting of african tribal and latin moves. Steps seen here are the triple step, strong arm movements, salsa, shoulder shimmeys, african footwork/arm movements, mambos, play the drums/maracas, double lunges, and hip shakes shimmeys. Marie will show the move first slowly, then will add arm movements, then will do the move at tempo, repeating a few times. She does this for all the steps, once each move is added and practiced a few times, she will take the routine from the top. Once all the steps are learned, you will run through the entire routine twice at the end. Reggae funk is the second dance routine, steps in this segment include reggae groove, single single double steps, twist shrugs, drop roll, butterly, dig freeze, and willy bounce and mambo sunshine. Marie teaches this one in the same manner. The routine starts out a little slow matching the music but picks up at the end and is a lot of fun. After this segment Marie leads you through a brief cooldown and stretch. I really like this video, Marie is a great instructor. I liked her quite well in Crunch Cardio Dance Blast and was hoping I would find another video with her in it. This video is good for clutzy types like myself, the steps are pretty easy to pick up, though I can't seem to get the single single double step down for some reason. Ths music is good, the set is clean and bright, and Marie and her participants seem to be enjoying themselves. Is this workout a sweatfest? No, but it's a nice way to get some light cardio and is great for days you are not up to a strenuous workout but want to get some movement. I find that I can be really lazy in the cardio department at times, but usually can muster up the energy to do this video. There are a few additional features on this DVD, a fitness do's and don'ts segment led by Chris Freytag, who leads many of the Prevention Fitness DVDs. There is also a Spanish instructions option, which I haven't seen in another workout. Overall I highly recommend this one. It has taken me a while to find a dance workout that I really like, I finally did 
I liked this work out. It is very easy to follow. The instructor, who is very likable, gives good instructions. She gives each dance move a "fun" name, so it is easy to remember. I do this work-out when I want to work-out, but do not have as much energy as usual or I will do it as a warm-up to another work-out. It always puts me in a good mood. I liked that it contains a good warm up and an isolation section. If you are looking for a hard-core dance fitness work-out that leaves you grasping for air as you are drenched in sweat, this is not for you. If you are looking for a fun, easy work-out, then this is for you 
This was a fun workout. It really gets the heart rate up and it is easy to follow 
If you have reasonable expectations of exercise DVDs, then you will ignore the review written by "AMAZON FAN" and take heed of all of the other reviews. Because this DVD is classified as a 'Fitness Yoga' DVD, you do have to assume that it is a DVD for exactly that, 'Fitness'. It is not, nor is it ever intended to be, an instructional for dance. You're browsing in the wrong category if thats what you're after. In fact, if you want to learn how to dance and will find yourself disappointed with any aerobics-esque moves, then shut down the computer now and go and sign up at your local dance studio. I own several dance aerobics DVDs and this is one of the best that I've tried so far - only topped by Madonna Grime's African Beat-Latin Heat DVD. Few dance DVDs strike that balance between being dancy enough to be original fun, and being easy to follow. This is as close as it gets to a perfect balance. Marie Forleo is a fantastic instructor, and goes through fast moves at half tempo a few times before letting it fly at full speed. That being said, full speed isn't breakneck speed; you are still able to actually DO the moves without compromising form. Here's what you get: 5MIN WARMUP - Marie takes you through about a 5min warmup that incorporates toe taps and step-touches - your basic aerobics stuff to get you started, and then with a few stretches to follow. Its not incredibly innovative stuff, but hey, its the warmup. It does its job, and thats all you can ask. ISOLATIONS - Now this is a good idea for those who are inexperienced with dance aerobics. This short segment guides you on correct form when performing the moves, and is a must-do for those who are new to this sort of thing, and in particular, those who are inflexible in the hips. 15MIN AFRO-LATIN DANCE SEGMENT - This is my favourite segment on the DVD. Marie goes through the majority of the moves at half tempo first - some of them are basic enough to learn at full tempo. There is some pretty quick footwork in a salsa move that she teaches at the beginning of the combination, though with a few times practice you should have it down. What struck me the most about this segment was that halfway through it the music suddenly picked up and was cleverly synched with the combination. The first half is very much a 'getting-your-heart-rate-up-and-learning-the- moves' segment and the music at this point is fairly stock-standard stuff. At the halfway point the music suddenly resembles that of a Brazilan Carnival, and it is at THIS point where you really start to get into the groove of the workout and find yourself having a blast. 15MIN REGGAE-FUNK DANCE SEGMENT - I wasn't too sure what to expect with this segment, since for me, Reggae Music has always made me want to go and lie down on a beach somewhere, rather than get on up and boogie. The choreography in this segment is innovative and funky, but the music is exactly as Reggae music is - laid back. The choreography does get your heart rate up and the moves are fun, but it doesn't draw you in like the Afro-Latin segment does. 5MIN COOLDOWN - Just like the warmup, this bit does its job. Marie goes through a few simple, non-dance inspired, low impact moves to lower your heart rate. Her stretches are not comprehensive, but they're not bad. There are a few extras on the disc; particularly a segment presented by Chris Freytag on 'The Do's and Don'ts of Exercise'. Rather than the Do's and Don'ts of 'Exercise', this is specifically of 'Toning', and she demonstrates what poor technique looks like and what you should be doing instead. For those of you who have attempted the other Prevention Dance DVD with Jennifer Galardi, you can relax. This DVD is nowhere near as fast paced as that one is. That DVD is a Prevention Express DVD, where the segments are only 10 minutes long - designed for a 'pop-in-and-dash-out-the-door' lifestyle. This DVD lengthens the segments a bit so that there is proper guidance on what to do, so you won't be left feeling as disheartened from trying to follow Marie's moves. Marie has one other DVD out, the 'Cardio Dance Blast' DVD from Crunch, which I found to be a bit slow and not as aerobic as this one is - though I have no gripes about her personality at all. She focuses more on technique and cueing rather than trying to motivate you. If you're looking for someone who will take your hand and walk you through a workout, congratulating you on every single step you take and telling you that you're beautiful and that they're proud of you, you need a Denise Austin workout. Marie is NOT Denise Austin (for some of you, knowing that will be enough to buy this DVD! Ha!) and cues and teaches very well. You need to do the motivating yourself. IN SUMMARY - 2 x 15min Dance Segments - Isolations segment for newbies - Afro-Latin Segment is most fun - Choreography is innovative and funky - Complicated and/or Fast moves are taught at half tempo first - Marie is a good instructor, but does not try to motivate Highly Recommended 
I LOVE TO DANCE .........SO I WAS EXCITED TO GET THIS!! WHAT A BORING DVD!! DID NOT SWEAT!! HATED HER COMPLICATED MOVES!!!!! SHE IS PRETTY BUT NOT MOTIVATING.......MY KIDS AND I JUST SAT ON THE COUCH AND WATCHED IT THINKING ANY MINUTE IT WOULD PICK UP THE BEAT! I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE REAL SPANISH LATIN AND REGGAE SONGS AND DANCING!!!!!!!!!!!! NO WAY IT WAS JUST SOME BEAT AND THESE GIRLS ALL DOING STEP TO SIDE THEN TO FRONT HANDS UP NOW TO THE SIDE......BLA BLA BLA.........WE EXPECTED UPBEAT MOTIVATING SONGS WITH LOTS OF DANCING AND FUN....I CANCELLED MY ORDER FOR ALL MY OTHER PREVENTION DVD'S ON THE WAY FOR FEAR THEY WOULD ALL BE LIKE THIS!!!! INCIDENTALLY I TRIED "PICK YOUR SPOT PILATES" FROM SOME OTHER GIRL AND IT WAS NOT ALOT OF MUSIC OR DANCE MOSTLY FLOOR EXCERCISE BUT IT WORKED AND HAD ME WANTING MORE .....SO I BLEW MY MONEY ON THIS THINKING IT WOULD BE MOTIVATING AND GIVE ME SOME CARDIO TO GO ALONG WITH THE FLOOR WORKOUT "PICK YOUR SPOT".....YOU ARE BETTER OFF TURNING ON THE RADIO AND JUMPING 
I wanted a workout that would be fun and that would also make me sweat. I love this DVD. I have two left feet and it was so easy for me to pick up the moves. Maria is a great instructor and she makes it so easy to follow the workout. 
I started with Cardio Dance Blast by Marie Forleo also and I like it so much that I was looking for more work out done by this girl. I found this DVD and I absolutely love it just as the other one. She is a great instructor. The way she breaks out the steps and put them together makes it so easy to follow. I am having fun and working out at the same time. It is the perfect combination. I started dancing with her like a month ago and I already have very good results. Finally my waist is shrinking! I highly recommend this DVD along with her previous one. 
Prevention bring out some good workouts and this is another of them. It's a fun dance workout that is easy to do because you sometimes don't realise that you are working out. The instructor Marie, has been in a crunch dvd I have and she's good in that and good in this. She's a good cuer and she's motivating too. She begins to teach a base move and then shows it at a faster tempo and then adds on to that initial move. The Afro/Latin section is the best because that's the funkiest and there are some cool moves. There is also Regae/Funk . The entire workout is about 50 or so minutes, but as I said, you don't realise you're working out, but in fact you are and you're also burning a lot of calories and fat. This is good. I enjoy it 
A fun film well loved in the former Soviet Union. A great cast and enjoyable story add up to 5 stars 
My wife, a Russian, turned me on to this movie a few years ago. Since then, it's been one of our favorites. It is definitely worth buying if you have any interest in Russia. So many everyday sayings came out of these old soviet comedies. It's also a more honest portrayal of Russia than we (Americans) have been fed since way back into Cold War times. It's important to note all the work that Image Entertainment has put into this edition. The audio/video quality is excellent as always. The menu page can be in English or Russian. The subtitles are in many languages including English and Russian. The Russian subtitles are very useful for people like me that have studied the language, but are not completely fluent, and also for the children of Russian immigrants. 
First time I saw this movie when it came out in 1971, I was 7 years old then. I remember, I laughed so hard I fell of the chair in movie theater. Now I don't fall of the chair just because I installed seatbelts on my couch. What makes a soviet era movie so good is that they all have clean humor pretty much rated `G' without need for profanity and cheap jokes of today's Russian flicks trying to imitate worst of American movie culture. This movie is still one of my favorites along with Diamond Arm and few others. 
This is one of the best comedies that were produced during the Soviet time. It's funny, pointed, and represents the best of Russian humor. All actors who play in this movie are the elite of Russian cinematography and hold a very special place in every Russian heart. Those who think of Russia as a gloomy grey place will be pleasantly surprised by this light-hearted, clean comedy, with its quotes being a staple of Russian language. What Wayne's World is for Americans, so Gentelmen of Fortune is for Russians. Strongly recommend it!! 
No commercials and I can watch it over and over again! What is better than that? For those who love early ER, this is a must! I am trying to collect all the seasons and the prices have been the lowest that I can find, not to mention the free shipping. A must see 
I have been watching ER since it started and This second season was just fantastic to watch. The extra features gives you your ER fix over the summer. I recommend to anyone 
As I said in my season one review, "ER" started off better than pretty much any show I can think of. It had an amazing feature-length pilot and then 24 incredible episodes which combined drama, comedy, and emotion perfectly. The good news is that season two is ever better. Season two gets off to a great start, as Dr. Carter returns to the ER to the scoldings and snide criticisms of Dr. Benton. This is a great season because it keeps the original cast together. It is not until the next season that Sherry Stringfield tragically leaves the show. This season has the whole original cast and the addition of Boulet, a wonderful new character who stuck around for several years. The adventures the ER staff undergo in this season include: Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards): Greene's obviously strained marriage from season one finally completely crumbles in this season when his terrible wife cheats on him and then leaves him for the other man. Dr. Greene takes the divorce hard, struggling with living as a bachelor until he finally gets back into the dating game near the end of the season. Doug Ross (George Clooney): This is perhaps Ross's greatest season, and the season defines everything that makes George Clooney a great actor and Doug Ross a great character. A major continuing storyline this season involves Ross attempting to help a little boy dying of AIDS, and how his decisions interfere with Greene's beliefs. Also, Ross stars in perhaps the greatest episode of the season, "Hell And High Water," where he saves a young boy from drowning in a drain. This episode won multiple Emmys, and is a tense and exciting piece of television, and one of the most memorable "ER" episodes ever made. Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield): Without a doubt Sherry Stringfield's greatest hour, this season wouldn't be nearly as memorable without her and her storyline is by far the best thing about the entire year. It's a major year of growth for Lewis, as her sister Chloe abandons her and leaves her with baby Susie. Lewis spends the year raising and loving the child, but trouble happens when Chloe returns and demands to have the baby back. Not to spoil anything, but one of the most heartbreaking "ER" scenes involves Susan and Baby Susie. It brought me to tears. John Carter (Noah Wyle): Carter has a very memorable romantic fling in this season with another practicing med student, but when she cheats on him with Ross, there is tension. Carter also gets in trouble with Dr. Hicks when he spends his lunchbreak boozing it up. Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies): This is a great season for Carol, as well. She spends pretty much the whole year dating the local ambulance driver Chep, and their relationship propels the year forward after the tragic death of Rowall, the other ambulance driver. This is a noteable season because there is not even a hint of romance between Doug Ross and Hathaway, as she spends the whole year dating Ron Rifkin. Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben): Boulet was the new addition to the cast in season two, and what an addition she was. In my opinion one of the most underrated characters ever on "ER," Jeannie has a very exciting year. She has an affair with Benton and ends up divorcing her husband, Al, but near the end of the season, she finds out that Al has been diagnosed with AIDS, and in the finale, she has herself tested. We don't find out the results until season three, however. Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle): A big year for Benton, as he gets Ross into some major trouble but then pays the price when he finds out some naughty information about a local doctor, Vucelich, and chooses not to tell the administration. All in all, an amazing year. The good thing about this season is that every character gets something noteable. My favorite of the cast this year would definately be Sherry Stringfield. Her story is unforgettable and it's a shame that the great writing couldn't stay with her character when she returned from 2001-2005. Once again, the DVD set is excellent and shows a lot of care. The widescreen transfers are nifty and give it such a cinematic look, and the special features are pretty generous, too. This just might be the finest season of "ER" ever. The storylines are totally gripping and addicting. Just trying watching one episode and resisting the urge to watch the rest! Nearly impossible! Buy this set now 
Wow. I didn't think it poossible, but several episodes are shot differently, and catch your attention explicitly. As good as the first mainly do to the chemistry of the original characters, still is not seen in today's episodes making these first two seasons invaluable to those who liked ER from the very beginning 
The great and elusive Ron Eldard guest starred as Shep the paramedic in Season 2 of ER. He steals every scene he is in. Watch it for early Clooney and great character work from Eldard 
I thoroughly enjoyed the first season of "ER," and the second season did not disappoint me either. If I had a problem with the series, it was in the different problems that the producers cook up for the main characters. Of course it's fascinating watching the choices that each character makes, but the problems are becoming more and more debaucherous. It would be nice to see positive character development instead of the constant angst that seems to be mounting underneath the surface. Watching "ER" is like eating chocolate: It's good in medium-sized doses, but too much at a time can leave a bad taste in your mouth. But I would say the purchase is worth the cost 
The second season of ER was great. High action and drama with some comedy thrown in. It made me want to rush out and get the third seaso 
and even today it still delivers the same impact that it did then. The acting of the main characters is superb, and their ability to deliver drama the way it is written and the way it should be is truly a gift to all fans of this show. I found myself watching episode after episode of this season as well as seasons 1 and 3. Season 4 needs to come out soon so as I can continue watching this series in order 
Nominated for 25 Golden Globes and 110 Emmys, including 7 for Outstanding Drama Series, ER has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television. Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood... ER follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy Chicago hospital. The show attempts to examine every detail of the ER experience. From the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork, all the highs and lows are covered. In the show's first year, a number of regular faces staffed the ER. Doctors Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), Douglas Ross (George Clooney), and Susan Lewis (Sherri Stringfield) were regulars in the ER along with Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) and Benton's medical student understudy (and later ER doctor), John Carter (Noah Wyle)... Any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show, interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere. The show's high drama, coupled with subplots of the staffers' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology, combine to make ER one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history... The ER (Season 2) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere "Welcome Back, Carter!" in which Carter arrives late for his new position in the ER while Mark gets comfortable in his new position among the senior staff. Meanwhile, the ER tries to patch up the victims of a rival gang war, and new medical school students arrive in the ER for their rotations... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include "Hell and High Water" in which Doug happens upon a young boy trapped in a drain pipe rapidly filling with water, and "A Shift in the Night" in which Mark is forced to carry the load of the ER by himself when Doug is out with whiplash and Susan is out on business... Below is a list of episodes included on the ER (Season 2) DVD: Episode 27 (Welcome Back, Carter!) Episode 28 (Summer Run) Episode 29 (Do One, Teach One, Kill One) Episode 30 (What Life?) Episode 31 (And Baby Makes Two) Episode 32 (Days Like This) Episode 33 (Hell and High Water) Episode 34 (The Secret Sharer) Episode 35 (Home) Episode 36 (A Miracle Happens Here) Episode 37 (Dead of Winter) Episode 38 (True Lies) Episode 39 (It's Not Easy Being Greene) Episode 40 (The Right Thing) Episode 41 (Baby Shower) Episode 42 (The Healers) Episode 43 (The Match Game) Episode 44 (A Shift in the Night) Episode 45 (Fire in the Belly) Episode 46 (Fevers of Unknown Origin) Episode 47 (Take These Broken Wings) Episode 48 (John Carter, M.D.) The DVD Repor 
The gift is a film about Annie Wilson a young woman with very real telepathic talents. Widow and mother of three, Annie Wilson, makes her living by foretelling others' futures, though her own has become cloudier than even she can see. Threatened by a client's violently jealous husband and plagued by visions of a missing towns-girl, Annie is unwittingly pulled into a thicket of lies and deception in which her extraordinary gift could be used against her and get her killed.I knew someone who was gifted, and from what I can tell, the movie was pretty accurate. And the musical score just heavenly. 
This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the "Spider-Man" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then. Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie. Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancee; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child. While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced debutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy. In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us. The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's "Furniture Room Lullaby" which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer 
This movie has great casting. The actors play characters that they usually don't play. This may be the best acting I have ever seen Keeanu Reeves do 
The Gift is a riveting, very well-acted movie about a woman named Annie (Blanchett) who still has not yet gotten over the death of her husband and struggles to raise her 3 young sons. She gets money from social security as well as supplements her income by doing psychic readings for many people in the town. One of her clients (Swank, who you can always count on for a remarkable performance) has an abusive husband (Reeves, fantastic as a wifebeater redneck here) who thinks what Annie does is witchcraft and he threatens her life as well as the lives of her children if she is to read for his wife ever again. Then, the daughter (Holmes) of an important man goes missing. She's engaged to a man named Wayne who works at the school where Annie's boys go (I believe he is the principal, but I could be mistaken...sorry, but in any event, played by Greg Kinnear). But there is much more than meets this eye in this gripping tale, and soon the police, with no clues as to where the daughter is, turn to Annie and her powerful gift to see if it can lead them in the right direction. I won't spoil the rest of it for those that have not seen The Gift. Look for an amazing Giovanni Ribisi in the substory as well...he's terrific here. If you enjoy thrillers and are intrigued by the plot, The Gift is something you will surely treasure as I have. Even if you question the validity of psychic readings, this is a very interesting movie that's best viewed with an open mind. Very recommended 
I really liked this movie and think is too underrated. It has a great story line and plot. Although Katie Holmes has a small part it is a good one. I really enjoyed this one. HAs quite a few twists as well 
I don't know if I'd say this is a VERY creepy film like "The Ring" and almost scary, but it certainly is strange, starting with the plot: Annie Wilson {Cate Blanchett} is a psychic who's "gift" is to see the future, and/or what has recently happened in a certain place, and she reads cards to the local people. When someone she knows mysteriously disappears, no one can find her. Sooner or later {after she is found dead}, the ghost of this woman haunts Annie and this "gift" is like something to protect Annie and her family, but in the process, the following situations become somewhat disturbing as the movie goes on because the acting and the cast are very well done. The characters make you have opinions about them. This movie is just so weird it's pretty tough to explain every detail...but then I'd be spoiling it, wouldn't I 
The Gift is a chilling tale set in the south written by Billy Bob Thornton, the talented man that also wrote Sling Blade. First off, it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO GIVE THIS MOVIE LESS THAN 3 STARS. Why? Because of the incredible cast. Here, you'll find probably one of the best casts ever. It has Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Greg Kinnear, an actor whom I can't remeber his name but who is brilliant and Keannu Reeves. Keannu Reeves? A good actor? Damn straight. He was brilliant in this movie and deserved an oscar nomination for best supporting actor. I am not kidding. His performance was remarquable! The movie is about a widow, mother of 3, making her money as a psychic. But, she gets involved with a woman whose abusive boyfriend is ready to do anything. This psychic is a scared mother that only seems to be loved and watched over by one person. And only one. You'll find that one out on your own. This movie is packed with suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. So, watch this brilliant movie that I will definitely add to my collection 
If you are a Sam Raimi fan then you know that his old car is always featured somewhere in his movies. This movie is great in every aspect but especially because if features "The Classic"( which is what Sam calls this car) in almost every scene. This adds a touch of comic delight to a very tense and suspenceful movie. This role is usually filled by Bruce Campbell but in lieu of his precense "The Classic" is a worthy stand in. All kidding aside this is an excellent movie and well worth your time. Keanu Reeves gives an excellent turn as a creepy wife beater. Cate Blanchet is as always flawless. Every role is excellently cast and acted with skill by all. Sam's direction is always great and this is no exception. 
For what it is, this movie is great. Very not typical of a Robin Williams film, but that's just my opinion. I have seen Robin do so much, from comedy, to this. I was very impressed with his acting. He made the movie and played the character perfectly. Plot This movie is basically about a photo obsessed freak who is lonely and shares his time constrcuting a collage of a frequent customer's family at the photo place he works at. After he is found out, the movie really starts to get interesting. "Cy" (Robin williams) does a variety of things to give off that "freaky, stalker vibe", and in the end, I really appreciate the orginiality of this movie, and I truly think it was an underdated release. Pro's: Of course Robin Williams acting in the film, Original plot/story line.... Cons: Wasn't the best quality, sort of low budget. Overall I was very pleased with this release. It's probably cheap enough now that to buy it would be worth it for any true Robin Williams fan, indeed 
This was a creepy thriller starring Robin Williams, which came out a few years ago. RW plays a clerk in a Walmart-like store, where he's the film guy, and has been for a very long time. He becomes obsessed with one particular family, who come in a lot for film development, and he begins to fantasize about being part of that family. He then discovers a family secret, which sends him over the edge. Williams does a good (and disturbing) job playing a quietly disturbed man 
For me this movie is good to watch at night. robin williams plays A photo developer a very lonly person who is obcessed with a young family and he steals copies of their photos he processes for them and hangs it on his wall in his half empty appartment. He has crazy fantasys of him being part of that family. He stalks the kid and the mother. And his store manager finds out he is stealing photos so he lets him go and he gets so depressed and before he leaves he finds pictures of the womans husband cheating on her so he switches the photos for the woman to see and the best part I liked was when sy breaks in their hotel and pretends he is taking pornographic pictures. best drama movi 
Robin Willams' performance carries the lackluster film. It was a very disturbing turn as Sal, a creepy photo guy from the pharmacy that takes a obession too far with a family that regularly comes in. He immerses himself into the family and calls himself Uncle Sal. the atmosphere was great and creepy and haunting. When you get done with the film, Willams' peformance will creep the hell out of you. Also, when the hotel scene comes up, be prepared because it is one of the most disturbing scenes in the whole movie. I highly recommend the film if you want to watch Robin Willams peform a serious role outstandingly. 
A truly great performance by Robin Williams as the lonely guy who desperately wants to be more than just a average photo developer, he fantasize about being a family member which develop into dramatic and frightning consequences for the part involved. Seen from a psychological point of view, this is not just pure entertainment, it reflect todays society in many ways, - solitariness. There are surely many lonely Sy`s out there, although not as extreme maybe, `this is study in human condition and it involves the viewer into territories of reflection about himself as a human being`... This movie has moments that stays with you forever.  
One Hour Photo. *** 3/4 Many people have covered the film's plot. I won't bore you with restating what many have already covered well. My take on this film is a little different. A persual of the reviews below I don't see this angle discussed. Its regarding Sy's damage. The film's ending makes the most powerful statement. That statement is damage of children by their parents. Sy's whole rationale for his frightening acts in the hotel were simple: Mr. Yorkin wasn't a good husband and father. The emotional outburst about photos of children and things they shouldn't have to do said it all. Sy wasn't monster, but a person who is really scarred. The expierences of his childhood made him a mess and unable to interact normally with people. At the end of the film I really felt for him. He became a wounded and damaged individual who had a normal life stripped away young. His obsession with the Yorkin's was based on the desire for a life he could never have. The film and narrative are well done and paced. It feels sort of like a documentary. The creepy Mr. Rogers tone plays well. There are the people who will see Sy's actions and place emphasis on them. Lost in those views is what the writers were really saying about one man. Specifically this one man. A man who is a abuse survivor and carries that deep damage. I didn't much care for the final scenes. Instead of the Yorkin's home safely as the closer. Adding Sy being helped as the final scene would've been much more effective. Speaking for myself, I wanted to see Sy get some help. Then pay for his crimes 
The particular and sick affective world of the primordial profile of the peeping Tom is to spy secretly behind windows, from the security boasted by the darkness. But the actual technology certainly allows to scrutinize with major intensity the particular spheres of other affective and emotional worlds. This serious affective disorder will constitute the dramatic axis around Robin Williams, an insipid and minuscule human being, filled of loneliness and hungry of affection willl fill his boring and non sense life. This is precisely what it happened with this original study around a isolated man who connects himself with the outer world , just because his work demands it. His personal fantasies fly in the wings of his febrile imagination. That is the way he gets inside into the particular universe of a middle class-family . There will be interesting twists and turns in this thriller that could have been even better. 
When it all comes down to it all you have is family. And when you don't have family you dont have anything. A very deep, and symbolisim strewn debut. A man is as fragile as a cracking windshield who returns home in the same rinse, lather, repeat he does everyday, like a hamster in a wheel. "It's probably the person you least expect!" Says Homer Simpson on Sy's (Robin Willams) television. "No one ever takes a photograph of something they wish to forget." Not a film that I soon will 
Robin Williams plays Seymour "Sy" Parrish, a soft-spoken, meek, lonely, photograph-developing technician who has worked at a "SavMart" store for many years and takes great pride in his work. Sy doesn't have much of a life, outside of work; he has no friends or family, and eats his meals at a local diner. But, he loves photographs. Over the years, he has followed the progress of a local family, the Yorkins, through all of the pictures they bring to him to develop, and Sy has a growing fantasy about becoming a member of that seemingly idyllic family. The fantasy grows to obsession, and Sy makes an extra copy of all of their pictures, to take home to his tiny apartment, to cover one entire wall. But, then things start to go very wrong. Sy gets caught making extra copies (the machine's counter-logs do not match), plus Sy discovers a flaw in the Yorkin family. With his fantasy and his job slipping away from him, Sy becomes quite unstable, and takes very desperate actions to try to make things right again. This is a very creepy movie. In the same way that "Fargo" portrayed a seemingly-ordinary person with enormous problems just beneath the surface, "One Hour Photo" makes the viewer wonder what insanity he or she has stared in the face, perhaps repeatedly, without ever being able to see it. Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds" also showed us how true horror does not have to come from monsters, but can be in the shape of sparrows, gulls, and crows. Other films have tried to portray this, but done it poorly. The babysitter-who-is-really-a-serial-killer has become a cliche, and never seems believable. In "One Hour Photo," we see a truly believable character, who drifts toward doing truly horrific acts, for reasons that are simultaneously irrational and understandable. Robin Williams is astounding in this role. We saw him do dramatic parts in "What Dreams May Come" and "Dead Poets Society," but "One Hour Photo" is an Oscar-worthy performance. In the first scene, I actually thought, "Is that Robin Williams?" He is the epitome of nondescript, bland, inoffensive, innocuous, and non-threatening. He is not just ordinary; he blends into the wallpaper. The cinematography, clothing, and set design all enhance this effect. In one of the DVD special features, you get to see him rapidly and abruptly switch back and forth between Robin the Irrepressible and Sy the Invisible. Truly amazing. As you might surmise, I highly recommend this one. Wow 
Along with the nanny, the stepdad, the cable guy, the 14-year-old girl with a crush... we now have the PHOTO PROCESSING CLERK to fear! Yes, everyone is out to get us.. or at least that's what Hollywood would have us believe. I am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality. No wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion, mistrust, fear (and the resulting isolation) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us. Yes, films like these have their place. However, I think Hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality. 
Not worth it - only for anti-Christians interested in conspiracy theory looniness. Thoroughly one sided, but that would be OK if it weren't riddled with inaccuracies - e.g. that Paul knew nothing of Jesus' ministry, and never quotes anything Jesus said. Any New Testament scholar sees Paul's view of Jesus as fitting hand in glove with what is in the Gospels (and Acts), though Paul has his own emphases, language, and theological framework. This joker... I mean, film-maker, thinks that Paul literally never believed that Jesus was a real human, living on earth. Geez. He could at least read the books Paul wrote! The film-maker manages to assemble a few crank PhDs, largely from fields outside of biblical studies, who think that the Gospels and Acts were either meant as fiction from the beginning, or else simply ridiculously innaccurate attempts at telling the truth. Oh, and there's the guy from the fringe, notorious "Jesus Seminar". Do you find the following sorts of arguments convincing? "The Jesus story has elements X, Y, and Z. So does the story of Hercules. But no one takes the Hercules story to be true! And elements A...N of the Jesus story can each *individually or in pairs* be found in various of these 26 legends. So... " If you don't spot any fallacious reasoning in the preceding, this is the documentary for you! The production values are pretty good (cheapie old Jesus-film footage aside), though intellectually, the whole thing feels like a sort of college film class project made by a "village atheist" type, who revels in cheap shots, scare-mongering (about those fundies who are no doubt going to sieze power any day now), a gotcha-question interview, and objections born of misunderstanding (e.g. thinking that evangelicals want an ancient-Israel style theocracy, with death penalty for gays - oh, yeah, that's on the agenda!) A favorite cheap shot - attributing these words to Jesus - "But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me" - words spoken by a character in a parable Jesus tells in Luke 17. Honestly, knowing something about the subject, it was hard to sit all the way through this stinker. And you won't have to know much to smell a rat. Sadly, the theologically and biblically illiterate crowd - e.g. who thought that Dogma or the Da Vinci code were remotely accurate - will find this kind of propaganda-like presentation impressive. It comes as no surprise at all, two-thirds of the way through, when we learn that the director is a bitter ex-fundie himself. In a way, it's like a certain kind of religious film, in that it never even tries to rise above preaching to the choir 
A very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex Christian.We need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general. I wish some brave person would do a film about how Christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective. This film touched on the subject, but it was not really the focus of the documentary.Perhaps we will be "blessed" by a further exploration of the subject in the future 
I think that every Christian in America should watch this film. This documentary focuses on what every Christian wants to ignor about God and the bible. 
The best part about this DVD is the features, particularly the interviews with Dawkins and Doherty. The director otherwise comes off as a preachy, smug arsehole, who gets a kick out of making fun of fundamentalist Christians, which is like shooting dead fish in a barrel. the film itself is awful, mostly bad graphics, worse soundtrack and awful clips from old 50s Christ dramas. Awful stuff. The big finale occurs when the director gets into an argument with a Christian school superintendent. Superintendent: It's a matter of faith. Director: But where's the evidence? Superintendent: We're teaching faith and love. Director: You're teaching lies!!! The superintendent, discovers that the director had misrepresented himself and the purpose of the interview and walks off in a huff. Apparently that proves Christ is a myth. Obviously the director had no idea how to transfer the concept of the mythical Christ to film. Read Challenging the Verdict instead 
This is not (in my opinion) for really overweight people. I liked it but had a really hard time with it 
I bought this DVD thinking I could get what my Pilates class gives me right at home. Boy was I wrong. This is a horrible example of Pilates. The sessions just goes through the motions. They don't emphasize the importance of form and breathing through out each session which is really needed for any skill level. The transitions are way too fast. Maybe I am spoiled by having such a great Pilates teacher but this DVD is a waste of money! 
This DVD is great for a beginner to learn the basic moves of Pilates and then progress towards doing the more advanced workouts. Good explanations 
This was the 5th Pilates DVD I bought and the only one that I actually use on a regular basis. It's done at a really good pace and there are several workouts to choose from so I can always fit it in. Since I've been doing these workouts I don't have a sore back after my walks and now that I can see my muscles and starting to have definition. So if you want to look and feel like your weight loss is actually getting you somewhere then get this Pilates DVD and do it. 
I was a little surprised at how challening the workouts on the DVD were, until I realized that there are multiple options and tons of variety. A full workout is very tough and I would probably only recommend that for intermediates or advance. Overall the workouts push you hard and do their best to stimulate actual class work. Defintely recommend for those that want a results driven workouts 
I bought this DVD despite the mixed reviews and have to report that I was disappointed with the purchase. I have another Pilates tape (not DVD) that was one continuous workout which I much prefer. With this one, there was no time in between transitions and there often were no clear transitions. I also found that it went way too fast and tried to cram in too many things into each session 
I think I just don't like pilates because I really didn't care for this workout. Plus, you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you'll have a round hard belly. This is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes. So, that's the main reason I just didn't like this video 
This video tape works, but it is basically a clip of people doing a different exercise each, all pasted together to make a full workout. I still think the moves work, but I'd rather follow along with someone doing a full workout with me 
The routines are pretty good, clear and easy to follow. The DVD does stop at different times thru the routine, which turns out to be an advantage because you get a moment to catch your breadth 
My kid likes to watch movies a lot. I've seen almost all of the Baby Einstein movies, tons of Elmo's world... you name it and we've seen it too much. Most of these movies teach and entertain our children, but few keep us adults in the mix. However, when this DVD goes in I actually find myself singing along and enjoying it more then I ever expected. Laurie's voice is phenomenal, and the songs are all very catchy with light hearted themes. The harmonies show that this could be an everyday rock/pop band if they were to go that path. My daughter sings the songs and dances (which keeps her active instead of just sitting around like a lump in front of the TV). She loves this DVD from beginning to end, and she isn't alone. The only bad part about these songs is that they are so catchy I have them in my head when I am trying to get stuff done at work! "Under a shady tree, you and me..." hahaha I couldn't recommend this more to a parent with young children. 
My son is 14 months and absolutley loves to watch and dance to this video. I highly recommend it 
I'm so glad we bought this. My youngest son (2 days from 2!) asks for "OooWa OOooWa!", his favourite part of "Walk Along the River". His older brothers (6 and 8) dance and sing with him to the entire DVD which is a rare achievement. My hubby and I have privately and jokingly cursed the catchiness of these tunes but are thrilled to have at least one disc our toddler will watch all the way through. Only my mother-in-law is sad--she cannot believe The Laurie Berkner Band has only one DVD 
We received this DVD/CD as a gift for my 5yr. old daughter's birthday. We loved it from the very first viewing! Laurie, Suzy, and Brian are not only talented but also appear to be very fun. While many children's music CDs tend to drive me crazy, I really do enjoy listening to this with my kids. 
My two grandchildren were completely entertained with this dvd. Laurie Berkner is very charming and personable and the entire dvd is very colorful. Definitely a good choice. Heathe 
My 1 yr old loves this DVD. She loves to dance and clap along to the songs. She is even starting to learn some of the words from the songs. I would highly recommend this DVD to any parents with young children 
My granddaughter loves this DVD. When I turn it on no matter what room she is in she comes a running to watch it. I wish that there was more DVD'S of Laurie Berkner Band. 
My 18-month-old son was saying "Laurie, Laurie" before a lot of other words. He loves this music. When he watches the DVD, he gets up and dances. In the car when we listen to the DVD, he kicks his feet in delight. 
My son is obsessed with this video! I don't know a child who isn't. My only complaint is that she doesn't have more out there 
My 2 year old loves watching the DVD as well as listening to the CD in the car. I have to admit that I have memorized all of the songs on the CD and the dances on the DVD too...they are very catchy and I find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around! The lyrics are really cute and the beats are great. Simple music but very creative. I signed up for updates on Laurie Berkner's website so I can find out when/if she ever comes to town so my daughter (and I, of course) can go see her. She is a great alternative to Barney and all of the other commercial characters, who I don't care much for. I have bought this DVD/CD combo for all of my friends who have kids 
Yes, I do agree with many of the viewers that the book by Hunter S. Thompson is better. However, I still found Terry Gilliams' wild and strange send up of the Hunter S. Thompson novel to be a great film nevertheless. [Much improved from Bill Murray's earlier attempt] Johnny Depp gave an excellent performance; however it was the character of Dr. Gonzo (Benecio del Toro) as the totally whacked out lawyer that I really found funny. [Funny in a very dark way]. This film may not appeal to many viewers, however, it appealed to me. I thought the characters of (Depp) and (Benecio del Toro) intriguing and hilarious. Plus, some of the other character actors in the film were pretty darn funny as well. I can understand some people not liking the film, as Terry Gilliam is not one of the easiest directors to follow: Especially his vision of directing. Moreover, when (Depp) and (Benecio del Toro) arrive in Las Vegas, the entire feel of the film gets really strange [Thank Terry Gilliam for this]. As I wrote before, the book is much better, however, the film is great too! Yes there is a lot of drug use in the film: One of the major complaints of many reviewers. I guess they don't know the life of Hunter S. Thompson, or his Samoan Lawyer: They were both drug abusers. Furthermore, I did not expect them to drink iced-tea, and lemonade while they were both on assignment. So, if the extensive drug abuse upsets you, this is not the film for you. However, the film [contrary to some viewers] is funny. At least in a dark way. If you don't want to purchase the DVD, especially the Criterion Collection of the film, rent it first to see if it is your taste. However, I thought it was a great film. And it is highly recommended 
I was "treated" to Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" on DVD. Based on the late journalist Hunter Thompson's book, this one had a few very funny moments, and the not-so-subtle message that real-life in Las Vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip, but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars (without paying their bills, of course). It was a step up from Bill Murray in "Where the Buffalo Roam", an earlier attempt to bring Thompson's antics to the screen, but still a pretty low step. 
As all pf us are aware about Terry Gilliam's border limits scripts, the repercussions and tendencies that occur, product of a progressive crumbling of the human mind; there us a visible breakthrough respect the established order, and the way to respond before this anomaly vary according the case. In particular, this movie may disturb most of viewers, in case you are not totally immersed in the spirit of that age, plenty of absolute lack of respect and negation of basic premises. Don't forget the famous French May's ideological emblem: "Forbidden to forbid" Caustic, acidic and uncensored gaze around these outlaw period of a recent history, that now is part of the anthological retrospective. All the cast was absolutely superb; and the movie reflected with absolute veracity the essential profiles of its hallucinating characters. 
A reporter and his psychopathic lawyer go to Las Vegas in order to report on motorcycle race...on just about every drug imaginable under the sun. That's pretty much the plot and the glory of Fear and Loathing is not its plot, but it's journey. Is it one long joke about the misperceptions, paranoia, and lunacy that happen while under lysergic influence? Yeah, and it is brilliant. It is a film worth seeing because it not only demonstrates (to the closest I've seen on film at least) just what a "trip" is like, but also it is a reflection on the transition of the late 60's to the early 70's and the "American Dream" (which those in Las Vegas so desperately seek to acheive). Johnny Depp masterfully channels the persona of Hunter S. Thompson (in fact, I keep forgetting during the film that it's Johnny Depp....truly a sign of great acting) and Benicio Del Torro plays "Dr. Gonzo" is a way that is a combination of humorous, curious, and frightening. The Criterion Collection did extreme justic to the transfer of the film (both audio and visual) and the extras are worth the time. At 29 bucks it is a costly venture, but well worth the trip 
I was one of the few that actually saw "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Not because of any affinity for Hunter S. Thompson(who I had never heard of before; forgive me I was fourteen), but after seeing this movie, which is best described as a "flawed masterpiece", I immediatley became a fan of the man, as I am still a fan of this movie. "Fear and Loathing", the movie, isn't flawless, as at times it can get repetitive and I wholly understand the people who say that this movie is nothing but mayhem on film and passed as art. This is not a picture for everyone and the people who do not like it are not wrong and don't neccesarrily "not get it". This movie is made a certain audience. The movie is good, do not let the above paragraph distract you, because it is expertly directed by Terry Gilliam, he of "Monty Python" and "Brazil" fame, who brings his slightly, okay totally, skewred perspective and skills to this film, and the two lead performances from Johnny Depp, who is flawless as "Raoul Duke", a Thompson psuedonym, a performance that isn't just mimicry even though at first it may seem that way, and Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, who some feel is a little over the top, but to me fits the vibe, anarchy for all vibe that the film has. Features wise this is another top notch effort from Crtiterion, featuring three commentaries---one with Gilliam, one with Depp and Del Toro and with the man Thompson himself---, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, an audio recording of Gilliam discussing the controversy over the screenwriting credit, tons of footage with Thompson, and a funny section of Johnny Depp reasing his and Thompson's correspondence with one another. The movie itself looks great, possibly even better than it looked in theaters. If you have yet to see "Fear and Loathing", well, you may wanna watch it before you buy it. But if you dig the flick on any level then this DVD is a must purchase 
Long on loathing. Boring, I fear. This trip was at somewhere I've never been, and I don't want to go there. A place beyond the event horizon. Who could care less about these people? Great title for a book, or a film, though. For some reason I've given it an extra star. I don't know why. Perhaps because it definitely belongs in anybody's collection of bizarre movies 
Terry Gilliam and Johnny Depp made as good a film as they could with Hunter Thompsons book (which was long considered impossible to translate to the screen) I think the people who slam this movie would hate anything by Hunter Thompson anyway. In order to please them you would have to alter Thompsons bizzare original vision so much that there would be no purpose in making the movie. By the way--Did anyone but me notice that in the "out of control in vegas" flashback scenes that Drew Carey and Diedrich "Oswald" Bader are in the crowd that is confronting Duke and Gonzo in a Parking lot? 
One of the best movies made, if youve never seen it what are you waiting for??, This is a great movie and with Criterion releasing it, your sure to get the best along with a 2nd disc of features... Criterion is best when releasing the best movies 
I lasted 10 minutes. At times, I believe Hunter S. Thompson was able to write. This was not one of those times. His gonzo humor was just over the top, not funny, and stale to these tired eyes. Maybe it was groundbreaking once, but I doubt it. Maybe you should watch it while stoned. He probably wrote it that way. 
Wow, I just viewed "Spun" the other night and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards. "Spun" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in "American Beauty"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy). I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit, who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead. This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas ï¿½kerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like. I'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes "Spun" better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply amazing. 
John Leguizamo is hilarious, and the movie has its very funny, quirky , unusual moments. Not a ground breaker but in your face / spoof of dirty white trash junkie movies. Lots of dirty jokes just plain nasty for those inquiring minds. The only reason I gave this movie Five Stars is because of a scene with John Leguizamo on the phone with a 1- 800 number girl naked with a tube sock, Mena Suvari on the toilet asking for toilet paper and the cops about to break in the crack house, if thats not funny then comedy is overrated 
Spun is an absolute pleasure to watch. It doesn't wait around to get noticed, instead it sets it's own pace, like for example - No credits roll in the beginning, no apologetic character introductions, there is no STOP sign in this film, everything is unhooked and raw,YET nothing seems to be out of place. The direction is bizzare, camerawork is staggering at places, the sets are like gutters, the music is extraordinarily amusing and the acting is another level. There are many characters in the film and a quite a wide variety too. The reason I compare Spun with Run Lola Run is because it was nearly as entertaining as the German wonderflick was. Spun is possibly one of a kind. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed Trainspotting. Now, that is saying a lot. Unfortunately, I haven't seen many movies like Spun in Hollywood. So I have no recommendations. This is an absolute must watch, if there ever was one 
There are dozens of Don't Do Drugs flicks that feel like after-school specials, with their sluggish morals and predictable endings. Well, I can say that the ending of this movie was predictable, but the build-up to it, the acting and the finesse with which the special effects were implemented (voices going in and out of focus, characters in fast forward, teeth grinding) had me SPUN from beginning to end. Though Brittany Murphy gets most of the cover, the story is really about Ross (Jason Schwartzmann), a part of a screwed-up extended family that are all hooked on methamphetamines, including secondhand dealer Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), spaced-out game geek Frisbee (Patrick Fugit), and others. When Ross meets Nikki (Murphy), he gets hooked up to the real deal: a man that calls himself the Cook, who wears boots with spurs and a cowboy hat and spits, fights, and tweaks like a man. The movie, for the most part, follows Ross's exploits as he becomes the Cook's errand boy, ferrying Nikki around in exploits like taking her dog to the vet (who has turned green from too much inhalation), and otherwise taking the Cook out to score, buy beer and porn, etc. The best part about this movie is the dead-on behavior of the junkies. They hug and kiss you, they reassure you with pretty lies, they make you feel right at home - but the second they're short on drugs, or you say the wrong thing to them, they scream and throw things around. The next day you're friends again until the next fight, which is never very far off. And though you are led to believe through the whole movie that the Cook is the head cheese, it is interesting (and accurate) to discover that he is reporting to someone even bigger. And yuck, is the personal hygiene right on the nose for these characters - their teeth are gritty, their clothes dirty and raggedy, and through the few days we follow them it doesn't appear that any one of them ever takes a shower. All they want - no, need - is their next fix. The part that sold me from the beginning was the words that came onscreen as the film started up: BASED ON TRUTH AND LIES 
The story here dosen't matter. The main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity. Rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius, a role he plays better than anyone today in film. BR 
'Spun' follows the lives of several methamphetamine addicts through their wasted, roller coaster days, but this is not your ordinary 'drug' film. The ambience and atmosphere is so in-tuned with this degenerated culture that you can smell the illegal drugs cooking. Giving the plot away would be moot, since it is a portrayal of everyday life for people of this particular scene. So, what separates 'Spun' from the rest of the drug flicks? Gritty realism, hilariously bizarre scenes, atmosphere, some great acting, and a complete lack of fear on the part of the creator and the director to dive into the nastiest of behaviors and expose them as pathetic and comical. The sets are what you will see in real life meth houses. The dress and behavior of the characters is very realistic. My only real problem with the movie is that some of the jerk/flash camera work gets a little annoying, but still serves its purpose of bringing the "tweak" to the screen. Interspersed in the film are some ridiculous cartoon scenes that are a riot, and two cops that parody TV shows like "Cops" and "Bounty Hunters", along with flash stills and hilarious action music. I am going to be haunted forever by the Spider Mike (John Leguizamo) scene where he is jumping up and down on the bed with a sock on his unit while abusing himself. You'll see what I mean, Leguizamo is brilliant in his role. Mickey Rourke has proven himself to be quite an actor, a chameleon who can adapt to any role. In 'Spun', he plays The Cook, a nasty loosing white trash cowboy type who cooks the dope for the gang. Watch for Ross's (Jason Schwartzman) hallucination of The Cook's all-American speech in the video store. "Ask not what the kitty can do for you (substitute the 'P' word for kitty), but what you can do for the kitty." Look for a surprising performance from Brittany Murphy (Just Married, Sin City) as Nikki. The more I see of Brittany's work, the more I like her as an actress. Eric Roberts (playing The Man) may have had one bad role after another, but his part in 'Spun' is perfect for him and very well done. The Man, with his earring and his muscle boys and his overdone lisp was too funny to watch. Roberts worked with Rourke in 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village' back in the early 80's, and its plain that they still mesh as actors. Watch for Debra Harry (80's group Blondie) as Ross's nosy neighbor, and Ron Jeremy, the king of p*rn, as the bartender in the strip club. All in all, 'Spun' is a movie with a serious twist that will leave you laughing in the wake of the character's bizarre activities. This is one of the best drug/bad behavior movies I have watched, right up there with 'Requiem For A Dream' and 'Kids'. Truly, a must-see movie. Enjoy! 
This movie takes you on a ride of a lifetime its pure entertainment as its cast of characters leave you shaking your head saying to yourself ill pass on the line of meth 
i love this movie. it's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment. WHERE IS THE SOUNDTRACK TO THIS MOVIE????? 
I'm new to the practice of QiGong..this DVD provides a powerful insight to its practice and depth of purpose. It is easy to follow and quickly absorbs one in the flow of using QiGong in one's life 
I purchased David Garripoli's VHS a few years ago and I realized benefits from the first session of doing the Wuji "Swimming Dragon". I first realized the sensation in the my crown chakra. I also felt that all important burst of energy that comes along with the appropriate and correct practive of Qigong. The directions are easy enough for a child to follow and Garripoli gives the historical background to this treasured Martial Art. I would and frequently do recommend Qigong to everyone-not all for it's health benefits but for it's uplifting spiritual benefits. 
I would have expected this many exercises to be split among three DVDs. And there is a bonus backgrounder -- it's like getting four DVDs for less than the price of one. This is informative, energizing, relaxing and well-designed. I received all of the exercises I wanted and more. I would recommend it to anyone 
This is a great DVD,the extra documentary discusses the history and current use of QIGong, with actual footage of the Masters in China. I found the QiGong easy to follow and to work into my personal schedule. It breaks it up into several simple areas and if I don't have time for the complete session I can do the areas I need most. I am a Reiki Master and I wished to broaden my energy work, this was really useful. I am also struggling to learn accupressure and QiGong in a 100 hr introductory class, this helped learning several of the movements my instructor was also trying to teach. To observe QiGong practised well, reminds me of watching ballet, as it is very graceful, with rounded movements that are enjoyable to watch and practice. As a nurse I am interested in energy work and exercise that can maintain health, flexibility, balance and strength that complements western medicine. QiGong can be a powerful tool to acheive this. I really enjoy this DVD as it is very well presented. I highly reccomend it! 
This is my first introduction to Qigong and found the documentary DVD and actual instruction very informative and easy to follow. I have been starting my mornings by following along with one or more segments (depending on how much time I have) and then moving on to the next segments on following days. If you are interested in Qigong - I would definitely recommend starting out here 
As a beginner, I am so glad I found this DVD. I don't even mind the hour and a half long workout! The movements are easy to understand and follow and Qigong has "kick-started" my body back to health! When I don't have time to practice all 18 movements, I do the short version that is provided at the beginning! Thank you Garrapolis 
Good introduction to Qigong. Mirror image instruction would have been helpful for some of the more complex moves and even some moves with back to the camera would have been helpful. Overall relaxing and precise. 
I don't really buy the whole "chi" healing power but it is very good for concentration and relaxation. The tape is very long (an hour and one half) and seems to be pretty well made. 
This is a great introduction to the world of Qigong exercise and meditation. The most valuable part of the set for me was the 2nd DVD, with the documentary on Qigong. I never knew that Qigong is a term and concept that embraces varied styles and methods of exercise and healing. I learned from the documentary that even the playing of music and Chinese brush painting can be a form of Qigong exercise and healing. The quality of the photography and demonstration is good and easy to follow. The movements are slow and relaxed, but I wish there was a multi-angle view of the exercises or at least a side and rear view of the movements. It was hard to understand the proper posture and stance of the exercises just from the frontal viewpoint. Another limitation of the instruction is that it does not provide a graphic illustration of the location of the energy centers (Dan Tian) and the path flow of energy throughout the body. I know Qigong is an internal as well as a physical form of exercise, and it would have been helpful to know how the exercises direct and distribute energy flow through the body. I wanted to know exactly where the dan tian energy centers are, and the way the exercises move energy through them. That would have helped me to understand the purpose of the exercises, and given me something to visualize and concentrate on while doing the exercises. 
 This is a very well-produced DVD that offers a solid introduction to the art of qigong. No one video is going to achieve great depth in a complex subject, but having seen a number of qigong videos (many of which have shot-in-the-basement production qualities and very minimal explanations)I would rank this as one of the best, particularly for a new student. The qigong forms presented here offer slow, dynamic stretching, deep gentle breathing, and they are enjoyable and relaxing to perform. The second DVD presents a fascinating documentary on the history of qigong. Well worth the modest cost 
The Harts, Max and Freeway made this one of the best series from the past.The chemistry between Wagner and Powers exploded on the screen.A modern day version of The Thin Man series of yester year, with William Powell and Merna Loy.They solved mysteries together getting tangeled up in all the plots and trying to get untangeled.Not without the help of Max, who was a character actor from the thirties and fortys and also acted with Shirley Temple. Can not wait for the third season dvd 
Why did Robert Wagner have a black eye throughout the first few episodes that not even makeup could hide 
At last, the eagerly awaited second series of Hart to Hart has hit the shelves. This series contains one of the classic episodes of the show, 'What Murder' where Jonathan loses his memory, forgets that he witnessed a murder and even forgets his precious Jennifer. Fabulous stuff. The quality of the transfers is good, not quite as clear as series one but an awful lot better than what most of us fans are used to! The two greatest disappointments are the appalling cover image and the lack of commentaries or featurettes. The covers of the 3 individual cases inside the box are much better, one in particular is a series two shot that should have been used for the box. But hey, it's the contents that counts and you don't get much better than this! Roll on series three and please Sony, we need a commentary on 'Hart of Darkness' 
I remember the the 70's well. This show was my absolute favorite show. I loved the chemistry between Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers. It came so naturally that they didn't have to work at it. You just knew they were having fun doing the show!! Who doesn't dream of having more money than they could ever spend, and also having the choice of whether to work or not!! Let's not forget Max, who took care of them - he sure had his hands full! He was more family than servant - and we loved him just as much. He just added to the show's charm. TV these days has become so much more serious and reality based. What fun to lose yourself in a show that was full of fun, charm, and bit of crime solving too! The show may seem dated nowadays but who cares! It's still a lot of fun to watch. My favorite episodes from this season were the one where Jonathon lost his memory and the one where he played his own uncle, Fritz Von Hart. What fun!! I can't wait to get this DVD set. Hopefully it won't be another year before Season 3 is released 
I was just a kid when this show was on... and I loved every episode of it. Back then, it looked sleek, chic, exciting, everything you could ask for from a tv show... just like Charlie's Angels... or Vega$... I remember them all... Almost 30 years later, it looks so dated... so different from today's fast paced, violent, end-twisting, loud, in-your-face TV. STILL we love it. The stories are so simple... and Wagner and Powers had so much charm... so much style. Let me add that today I guess I still secretly dream about having a 1978 Mercedes-Benz yellow wagon with that big telephone (laughs). It used to be so super cool!!! Wathing those episodes made me feel again like a 6 year-old kid just being introduced to late 70's television - the jokes, the kitchens, the hairdos, the telephones, VCRs, big cars, disco... Oh, and I loved Mark Snow's theme. I recognized it instantly... And Max's introduction to Mr. and Mrs. H... whose hobby is murder!!! Do you want to know what were the dreams of the middle class' during the late 70's? Watch Hart to Hart. Everything was great. Everything was ideal! What a great show! Thanks for the memory. PS... someday, someone will write a History of american society through the 20th century's TV shows' point of view. I'm sure Hart to Hart, Charlie's Angels, Moonlighting, Magnum PI (and many many others)will all have a lot to say. A classic!!!!! 
For five wonderful seasons, "Hart to Hart" was about the most fun you could have in an hour without getting into any trouble. Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers were simply perfect as the rich couple with nothing to do but solve murders. They were Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, living the fun life we all wished we had. The chemistry between Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner was natural and you could always tell, especially with Wagner, that they were having a ball. Sidney Sheldon created the characters but it was really a stroke of genius to cast Wagner and Powers. Wagner took his cool Alexander Munday persona from "It Takes a Thief" and just made him richer and happier, with a lovely companion he got to keep. Stefanie Powers always had a certain something but had never really found the right part, until Hart to Hart. Jennifer Hart came so naturally that you couldn't help thinking she wasn't really acting at all. Come to think of it, the same could be said of Robert Wagner's seemingly effortless turn as Jonathan Hart. This was heaven for light mystery fans. There was always plenty of fun banter between Jonathan and "Mrs. H" and enough humorous situations mixed in with the latest week's adventure to keep everyone tickled pink. Not to be undervalued as the reason the show was such a big hit, was Lionel Stander's role as their butler, Max. Max was much more like family than hired help, and in the show's opening every week, you knew right away Max was an important part of the proceedings. After introducing the self-made millionaire, Jonathan, and his other boss, Mrs. H, Max always stated that he had trouble taking care of them, because their hobby was murder! Not to be forgotten, of course, was their lovable dog, Freeway, who sometimes forgot who was the owner and who was the pet. The stories were frivilous fun, as this wasn't real danger, just TV danger, and we always new our favorite husband and wife would solve the mystery and uncork some champagne at the end. Fans of the show were delighted when the first season of this fun show finally got a DVD release and are once again made happy by the release of season two. A lot happened in the second season as the show just kept getting better. Jonathan had amnesia after an accident and forgot a murder in one episode. In another, Jennifer was kidnapped. Max's ex-wife showed up and caused tons of trouble. And Jennifer was stalked by a mummy when a not so ancient body was found in an Egyptian sarcophagus! "Hart to Hart" was delightful escapist fare. Mark Snow's "Hart to Hart" theme at the opening of the show was light and breezy, and fans looked forward to hearing it every week. Snow would finally become famous for his moody theme for "The X-Files." The episodes for season two are as follows: Murder, Murder On The Wall, What Murder?, This Lady is Murder, Murder is Man's Best Friend, 'Tis the Season To Be Murdered, Murder Wrap, Murder In Paradise, Ex-Wives Can Be Murder, Murder is a Drag, Hart-Shaped Murder, Slow Boat to Murder, Murder in the Saddle, Homemade Murder, Solid Gold Murder, Getting Aweigh with Murder, The Murder of Jonathan Hart, The Latest In High Fashion Murder, Operation Murder, Murder Takes A Bow, Blue Chip Murder The domestic and mystery adventures of the self-made man, Jonathan, and his ex-journalist wife, Jennifer, made for a charming and breezy hour of pleasure. The adventures of the spohisticated couple, who it turned out were just like us, only rich, was a great way to unwind at the end of a long day, and still is. Every TV mystery fan will want to pick this one up. So pop the cork from the champagne in the limo, call ahead to make sure the private jet is waiting, and jot off to TV land, where rich and attractive couples delight us by solving murders while living the life of leisure for a second season. Great fun 
This was one of the finest written, and acted shows ever on television. The stories were truthful and heartbreaking. The characters flawed and likable. It is a shame for the fans of O to have to wait years between the release of the 3 seasons of this show. Especially when you see so many shows of, let's say it, "LESSER QUALITY" like "The Dukes of Hazzard" has SEVEN seasons released. Buena Vista, this is just sad. Release season 3 for the die-hard fans of the show PUHLEEEEEEZE 
Watching "Once and Again" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again. This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date. I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them. Watching "Once and Again: The Complete Second Season" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning. There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family ("Scribbling Rivalry"). Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again. If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through. If the first season of "Once and Again" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance. There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., "Scribbling Rivalry") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell ("Edifice Wrecked"), than there is about them being with each other. While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, "Feast or Famine"). The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well). So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother's daughter, which is not always a good thing ("Best of Enemies"), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating ("Food for Thought"). Having Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on "thirtysomething" all over again. But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick ("Ozymandias 2.0"), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot. This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live. But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting ("Edifice Wrecked"), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison ("Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight"). When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious. This really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters. Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun ("The Other End of the Telescope"), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby ("Forgive Us Out Trespasses"). Judy comes up with the great idea of "Booklovers," despite Lily's negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck. Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music ("I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down"), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue. Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December. I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation. So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli's parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation. My only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental. At least when she does not immediately accept Rick's proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring. The fact that season two ends with the wedding ("The Second Time Around") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking "Once and Again" was simply about Lily getting remarried. It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD 
Buena Vista Home Entertainment You Stink As A Studio, Where Is Season 3 On Dvd? Of Once And Again 
I miss this show so much, Once and Again was such a great show with a well-talented cast. Sela Ward, Billy Campbell, Evan Rachel Wood, Shane West and the rest of the cast played these characters with authenticity and strength. Wood went on to star in the incredible film, Thirteen, I just knew her career would take off after this show ended third season. In the second season of Once and Again, her charater Jessie struggles with anorexia, her scenes are so touching and raw, what a gifted young actress, she was the main reason I tuned in every week, just remarkable. Sela Ward is good in everything she is in. My fave episode is the Thanksgiving episode. Patrick Dempsey guest starred as Ward's mentally challenged brother from time to time. I hope the third season gets released but I doubt it. All the finest shows on t.v. get the ax way too soon, it's a shame. Buy this, you won't regret it 
Sorry, M. Dallas. The final episode of "Once And Again" was not a two hour event. It was a regular hour-long episode that aired April 15, 2002, as part of a truncated (from 23 episodes down to 19) third season. It ended with the fourth wall being broken, and the cast and crew spoke as themselves of what the series meant to them. There's still no word as to when a DVD set of season three will see the light of day. I am so disappointed with Buena Vista over this. Come on, BVHE. There's a real demand for this series. If you're a fan of O, and haven't bought the first two seasons, then PLEASE do so. Then maybe Season Three will finally see the light of day on DVD 
In response to Sue A. Elkins of Bloomington, IN, yes, there are only three seasons. The show was cancelled in it's final season due to ratings. I remember the last episode when it aired as it was a two hour event. Season three, the final season, was scheduled to be released this last January. Commentary for the final episode has been done in late summer as they had planned and anticipated to get it released right away after the release of season 2. However, in late October, announcement came out (although not too boldly), that it'll be delayed. Word of it's new release date have not been annouced as of yet--at least not to my knowledge. Hope this helps and gives you some insight 
I loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3. WHERE IS IT? I hope that it is released soon. It seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending! A little unfair to the consumer don't you think! It is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is. Is that correct 
This series was just an average series, overall. However, I give it 5 stars because of the superior performance of adorable, young Evan Rachel Wood. Evan has a very bright future ahead of her and will someday be one of the most successful actresses in Hollywood. Just watching Evan makes this DVD well worth the purchase price 
I was a huge fan of Once Again's brand of adult melodrama, but it's worth noting that season 2 was the weak link in its illustrious three years. I was never nuts about the Atlantor/ Miles Drentel plotline that dominated Rick's (Billy Campbell) year - his ambition was interesting enough, his crises of conscience and "darker side" weren't as much. Campbell does a rousing do-gooder, but in truth, he was always Once's least interesting character, and made a better as a supportive rod in the background than lead. I was also not nuts about Lily's stint as trailblazing editor's assistant - not because Sela Ward's plotlines were insubstantial (for proof, take one view of her rabblerousing sexual harrassment episode "Suspicion" - which likely netted her deserved Emmy for the year), but because Jennifer Crystal Foley's artist/brat-in-a-power-suit-and-pigtails Christie was always more annoying than welcome. But if some of the bigger plot machinations didn't work, Once Again moved hearts left and right with its smaller moments and extraordinary support cast. Grace (the extraordinary, underappreciated Julia Whelan) stealing from Jessie in spite of herself ("Thieves Like Us"), Judy's love of Salinger and singles' nights ("Booklovers"), another terrific guest appearance by Patrick Dempsey ("Aaron's Getting Better"), and, especially, the emergence of Evan Rachael Wood as a major young actress - her heartbreaking work in "Food For Thought" steals the season. Capping things off appropriately, the season ends in "Second Time Around," a wedding episode that's square, earnest, and simply so moving, your deepest melodrama-loving dweeb is unleashed, laughing and crying in spite of itself 
Season 1 and 2 of "Once and again" were simply fabulous and great. And I was looking forward to getting Season 3 on DVD when it was announced for January 2006. Now it is suddenly pulled from the release schedule. Why??? I sincerely hope that all "Once and again"-fans stand up for this and urge Buena Vista to release Season 3 as soon as possible!! 
I terribly disappointed by this movie. It bears some resemblance to The Bone Collector and Silence Of The Lamb, but has none of the suspense, mystery, good acting and good story that these other movies have. This lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end. The cops were basically two idiots who couldn't solve the crime on their own. Add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie. 
This movie is weak, poorly written and has some laugh-out-loud stereotypical cop-schlock dialogue. The acting is sub-par for such a wonderful cast. How numb are we to poor writing that we accept such drivel? I'm amazed at the way people compliment this film. Really- Deep? Symbolic? c'mon! This is film is as about as deep as a kiddie pool 
I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said. This movie is frightening, extremely suspenseful, revolting, and, above all, undeniably compelling. Fincher is in fine form regarding the direction of this movie, and Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman (one of the best actors of our time), Kevin Spacey, and Gwenyth Paltrow turn in exceptional performances as the main characters. This is easily one of the best films of the 90s, and any true fan of motion pictures should add this collector's edition to their DVD library 
This clever and gruesome film was released in theaters in 1995. Definitely not for the squeamish but if you can even try to peek through fingers, this movie will keep you riveted. Morgan Freeman is a soon to retire police investigator, who gets paired with a nearly-rookie, Brad Pitt. Our young hero is married to Gwyneth Paltrow. The idea is vaguely reminiscent of the Lethal Weapon duo but it's not a laughing matter. The crimes they are investigating are heinous, and point to a diabolical serial killer who has a penchant for rendering justice upon those who have committed the "seven deadly sins." Kevin Spacey is particularly brilliant in his performance as the mad man, but all actors shine in this one creating a stark contrast with the gruesomeness. Nicely done. 
Ohhhh! I caught this movie on regular TV and even with commercials it was good. I bought it so I would get the whole movie. I have watched it a couple times myself and also a couple more times with friends or family. A really amazing and edge of your seat movie and the ending will totally shock you! 
Se7en is not only my favorite film of all-time, but the one of the few films that gave me hope for the future of filmmaking. I love every shot in this masterpiece and concludes with the greatest third act I have ever witnessed. If you have not seen this film, watch it. Allow it to change your life 
I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. The movie is included among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. This New Line Platinum Series edition is really beautiful, with a DVD case simulating the notebook that John Doe uses in the movie, and with a second disc full of supplemental material. I miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory "How it was made" or "Behind the Scenes" documentary. You see deleted scenes and extended takes, alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards, etc. The movie in Disc One comes with an audio track specially recorded for the DVD edition, and in my Home Theatre sounds terrific. Also we have 4 different audio commentaries, by director Fincher, Freeman, Pitt and other collaborators on the film. This is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives (one new -Pitt- another about to retire -Freeman-) after a serial killer (always brilliant Spacey) who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins, and kills people who represents them. After the 5th murder, he turns himself in and the last two (Envy and Wrath) are just a masterpiece of an invention. I've probably seen this movie just 3 or 4 times, but I can't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story. This is a masterpiece of a movie. I rarely give 10/10 points to movies, so I gave this 9.5/10. To be picky, I'd like a "Hit" song with the closing credits. But that is just me being picky. The music by Howard Shore is good. The photography is excellent, the script is in my opinion the very best, and Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are fabulous. The movie was nominated for Best Film Editing for the Academy Awards but won nothing. A must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan. Your collection is not complete without this one. And for the price ($13.99 while I am writing this) you can't get any wrong 
This chilling bit of film noir features almost unimaginable cruelty, graphically expressed. What separates it from movies where blood flows like beer at a frat party is that the violence is never gratuitous, it is at the very center of the story, informing both character and plot. Se7en is defined by superb art direction and an extremely intelligent script. The overwhelming sense of dread and impending doom are reinforced with every carefully managed detail - the murder scenes in particular are so meticulously realized they resemble paintings. The script sends characters, and viewers, scampering to the library in an attempt to understand the murderer's mind. The bible, Milton, Chaucer, and Dante all contribute significant plot points - this is a film that talks up to its audience. The full weight of this fleur du mal rests on the capable shoulders of Morgan Freeman, one of America's greatest actors. His wise, world weary, and patient performance fully embodies the sense of hopelessness experienced by those who understand evil and cannot defeat it; brilliant. Gwyneth Paltrow is deceptively effective, her fragile beauty and innocence are there to remind us that, unlike the early victims who courted their fates by wallowing in sin, true evil inevitably destroys the guiltless as well. R. Lee Ermey, the Police Captain, unforgettable as the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, is visibly playing the role rather than being the character - he is ham-fisted at best. But the real tragedy here, deadly sin number eight, is Brad Pitt. One cannot excuse his wretched performance by saying that he is playing an idiot. It might be more accurate to say that he lacks the technique and talent to act the part of an idiot - and simply being one is not the same thing. Watch him again and notice his tendency to throw his hands purposelessly, as though he is trying to detach them from his arms. (This ludicrous bit of physicality was carried to an absurd extreme in 12 Monkeys, the Terry Gilliam masterpiece.) Kevin Spacey, who only appears in the third act, is nothing short of stunning. He manages the impossible challenge of making this larger than life monster real with an ease that seems effortless, an amazing achievement. For those of you who saw the end coming, well, there's always Barton Fink. Se7en is a brilliant descent into the dark places of the human soul - certainly worth owning 
Se7en is one of the best crime thrillers of all time and probably has the best cinamatography I've ever seen, the film has the darkest atmosphere and probably influenced a ton of other generic hollywood thrillers and yet remains the only original thriller that manages to creep you out with out having any cliches. Both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were terrific in thier roles as the two detectives and have a tremendous job of making thier characters more than one dimensional you also get to see thier personal lives and then wonder how they don't get effected by the violence that surrounds them. All the se7en grisly murders that occur in the film are based on the seven deadly sins like greed, envy, sloth ect. that are done by a mysterious killer called John Doe cause they obviously don't know his name. So the film turns into this ultimate cat and mouse game with a very nice backdrop of the city which looks dark and is constantly raining, David Fincher does a great job with the direction almost giving it a gothic look. Overall this film is fantastic and is highly recomended don't miss it 
This is one of the best editions ever. Being a graphic designer is great to have a high quality item like this on a DVD collection. Well, even if I wouldn't be a graphic designer I would love this edition. Of course is not only the amazing "diary-like" package, or the great amount of detail on it, the movie, the director, the great cast, the bonus material and special features makes it one of a kind edition. Highly recomendable 
An outstanding, beautifully produced movie with an exceptional cast. Anyone who enjoys historically-based dramas will certainly find this movie quite captivating. 
The intent of the director was to capture the ATMOSPHERE or "flavor" of the Elizabethan court. Intrigue, alliances, deceit, ambitions, trechery and emotions. In addition he means to show us that Elizabeth was a human being thrust into power, and all that power demands. On those points he got it right ALTHOUGH people were not quite as clean and good looking then. Times were brutal. A toothache could kill you. Lice were everywhere. Those who criticize on historical accuracy complaints miss the point. An historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more. The movie probably could have been a little longer as it is. Worthy of multiple viewings 
This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history 
A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong. Why not just make up a story with no historical basis 
Very few historical movies are historically accurate. Who cares? That is not the point. If anyone relies on movie to get their history lessons, then they are pitiful in the first place. The primary purpose of movies is to entertain. Its likely that anyone interested in 'Elizabeth' is not the run of the mill 'Die Hard' fan to begin with, and probably has some true historical knowledge. Those seeking historical facts should visit their local library and stay away from the video store. 
To borrow from a previous reviewer: A movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering. 
To those of you, who have yet to realize what an amazing actress Cate Blanchett is, look no further than 'Elizabeth'. The characters, the costumes, and the production designs are good enough to make this movie watch able, but it's Blanchett who breathes life into the film and makes it cinema storytelling at its best. The story revolves around the rise of the young Queen Elizabeth I (Blanchett) who would soon become one of England's most powerful rulers. Reviled as a heretic by the Catholic Church, surrounded in the midst of traitors, and caught up in a romance with a young Lord that could jeopardize her crown, Elizabeth is forced to learn that as a queen... she must become untouchable in order to maintain her throne. The supporting cast does an excellent job with special nods to the ever elegant Geoffrey Rush, but it's Blanchett who manages to steal each and every scene. Her performance was more than Oscar worthy, and is surely one of her best. Some have compared this with `Shakespeare in Love' which includes two of the main leads from this film and was also released in the same year. Both are good films, but whereas `SIL' plays generally for laughs, Elizabeth is a serious film that should be taken seriously. There are historical plot holes - but these should not be used as a reason for slating the film. In fact it seems that Hollywood encourages this type of approach these days. There are any numbers of unexplained actions, and characters are sometimes hard to identify, but the camera work, color, and scenic backgrounds are superb. Locations are all real, and the acting is uniformly convincing. If an initial viewing leaves you a tad confused, do a little reading on the period, see the film again, and enjoy it all the more. 
I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie. 
I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film. But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor. Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes. And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever. I was sorely disappointed! If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson. And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell. Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days. Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times. This film just doesn't cut it 
I love this show. I would recommend it to anyone. I wish it was still on the air. I like that it includes the kids and the ex-spouses 
I do not know if I can take another television series created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick. When they came out with "thirtysomething" in 1987 it was like watching our lives on TV. I can still remember all the married couples that talked about how they recognized themselves in the myriad machinations of Michael, Hope and the gang. Then in 1999 they came back with "Once and Again," and all I can is that I hate to think what would have happened if I was not already where the characters ended up in the third season, because if I was still in first season mode when this aired it would have been way too painful. In fact, I would maintain that there will always be moments from this series that will threaten to rip off the scabs, twist the knife, or at least keep you up all night because they hit too close to home for those who have been involved with a divorce. You might have heard originally the idea with "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was for Mary Richards to be divorced, and they could not get that idea to fly because the networks thought audiences would think Laura had divorced Rob Petrie. But divorces are so painful, despite their regularity on soap opears, that there have been other concerns with having a show that is about divorce. "Once and Again" is more about life (and love) after divorce, and the series dodges a major bullet by making sure the principle couple to be are already divorced and separated respectively when they first meet and sparks start to fly despite the train wrecks that are their lives. This television series might be too painful to watch for some (I want to be Rick but I know I am a lot closer to Jake and that conclusion certainly hurts), but that is what happens with shows that are real rather than merely being considered reality programming. The fortysomethings in the main spotlight are Lily Manning (Sela Ward), who kicked her husband Jake (Jeffrey Nordling) out of the house for having an affair, and architect Rick Sammler (Bill Campbell), who has been divorced for three years from Karen (Susanna Thompson). Lily works part-time at a bookshop with her sister, Judy Brooks (Marin Hinkle), while Jake runs the restaurant once owned by Lily and Judy's father, and Karen is a lawyer. Both ex-couples have two children. Living with Lily are Grace (Julia Whelan), an awkward high school freshman, and young Zoe (Meredith Deane), who has the ability to ask the pointed question at the wrong moment. Living with Karen but frequently visiting Rick are Eli (Shane West), a high school junior who plays basketball and has some sort of learning disability, and Jessie (Evan Rachel Wood in the role that first got out attention), who is smart, thin, and working on her black belt in tae kwan doe. Lily and Rick meet at the high school when Grace has an injured ankle and Eli has academic problems, and from the start the couple find they are embarrassments to their children ("Pilot"). Rick is clearly smitten and Lily is surprised to find herself enjoying a relationship with another man ("Let's Spend the Night Together"), which is not easy when she finds herself working with his ex-wife at a school carnival ("The Scarlet Letter Jacket") and her sister clearly disapproves of the guy ("Liars and Other Strangers") and his involvement in Lily's life ("A Dream Deferred"). Meanwhile the kids have resorted to parallel euphemisms: Lily is "The Mom" and Rick is "The Dad" and have to deal with their own teenager crises in terms of sprained ankles ("The Ex-Files"), out of control parties ("Outside Hearts"), and the revolving door of adolescent affection ("Sneaky Feelings," "Daddy's Girl"). Then there are the ups and downs of the love lives of both Judy ("The Mystery Dance") and Karen ("Cat-in-Hat"), in the wake of Lily and Rick's romance, as well as Jake's ongoing involvement with young Tiffany (Ever Carradine) becoming painfully clear to Grace ("Letting Go"). There is a major subplot in the first season regarding Lily's father, Phil (Paul Mazursky), who shows up for "Thanksgiving" expecting things to be patched up between Lily and Jake, who is clearly more like a son than a son-in-law, to Lily's absolute frustration. Add to the interpersonal complications, which includes Lily's brother Aaron (Patrick Dempsey), the escalating financial problems of Jake that are putting the house that Lily and her daughters live in at risk ("Mediation"), and force Lily to go out and fin a job ("My Brilliant Career"). As for Rick, Herskovitz and Zwick introduce him to a new circle of hell when who else but familiar face by Miles Dentrell (David Clennon), who has relocated to the Chicago area from Philadelphia. The conceit of the series was the use of black-and-white "interview" segments where the characters admit to themselves things they would never say aloud. This matters on "Once and Again" because getting these characters to say what they are thinking without being prompted by anger or fear is often difficult and our feelings towards Grace, Judy and Karen are tempered because of these moments where their pain becomes most clear. The season ends with an indication that the genesis for this series might have been the romance between Lily and Rick, but that what it is really going to be about in the next two seasons is how these two families become one, while maintaining tangible links to the families they were in the past ("A Door, About to Open") 
i wish that there would come out with the 3rd season of once and again i just love that show soooo much. i wish it was still on tv 
If you have not seen this series, I strongly urge you to give it a try. Young Evan Rachel Wood is simply the best teenage actress in all of Hollywood! My heart just ached for her, as her character dealt with the problems of her parents being divorced. Evan, you are the best 
There are very few shows in my lifetime that I have been fiercely loyal to, but the now defunct `Once and Again' without question, topped that short list. I will admit that my lifelong crush on actress Sela Ward was my main interest in this series, originally. Single, with no kids, and in my late 20s during O's debut, I was far out of ABC's target demographic for this show. I didn't expect to like the show very much, but I got sucked in not because of Sela, but because the show was nothing less than fantastic. Superbly acted and superbly written, ABC never gave this show a chance to find its audience, and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it's all too early demise. Even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance. The premise of the story is of Rick Samler and Lily Manning, two fortysomething single parents who re-enter the adult dating scene after their divorces. They fall head over heels for one another, and find that life and love in the (then) late 1990s is far different than what they remember. Adding children, careers, parents, and ex-spouses to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for Rick and Lily. Most shows `jump the shark' at some point during their lifetimes. While some could argue that the hostage episode in S2 was that point for O, I disagree. Once and Again always presented two kinds of television : good, and better. The stories and characters could fill you with hope, heartbreak, or both every week almost without fail. And best of all - everything about this show was real. Very little, if any, suspension of disbelief was required. Perhaps the best thing I can say about O is that it is the only show that I was so passionate about saving, that I sat down and wrote a letter to ABC, asking them to reconsider their canceling of it (as part of an organized campaign with other fans). While the campaign wasn't successful, the release (finally) of the series on DVD will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever, as well as allow those who didn't get to view O during its run to discover it, and they too, might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story 
'Once and Again' represented to me the highest point in television drama. This more-than-memorable series was no doubt one of the best to ever grace the airwaves. Fine acting, brilliant writing, exceptional direction and noteworthy plotlines were the consistent standard for this series. Not only did it excel in the heretofore mentioned categories, but it also broke some barriers for what television could do with a drama series. Intimacy, nudity, sexuality, and other sometimes taboo subjects were handled with truth and honesty. Deep character development was the standard not the exception...even for characters that had more peripheral roles. The series was genuine. I never felt a false moment. I was heartbroken to see it end after 3 brief years. Apparently mainstream Americans found this degree of depth in a television series too much to handle after a long day at work (or perhaps after 9/11)...or perhaps ABC did not promote it in a proper timeslot. Regardless, My only solace remains that I can now revisit it from time to time thanks to the release of the series via DVD. 
"And so my course is clear: to go through life pretending to have done and seen things that have hardened me -- made me aloof and unreachable. Which works, until I need to ask a stock boy where they keep their corn meal. Then the facade crumbles, and it's clear that I'm not a weathered loner who's seen too much; just a pasty Midwesterner who can't find the flour aisle." - Mike Nelson, 'Movie Megacheese' 'Once and Again' is about people like this, people who live in America's fly-over country, have never been homeless, are not famous, don't fight crime or work in hospitals, don't shop in SoHo or Beverly Hills. In real life, they vastly outnumber the homicide detectives, criminals, trauma surgeons, and island castaways who comprise such a disproportionate percentage of the central characters on television dramas. Why? Two reasons: (1) Most TV writers think they're boring and lack the insight and skills to write about them in ways that viewers will find interesting. (2) When a show that deals with this kind of material makes it on the air, it depends on large numbers of viewers in order to remain in production. Most television viewers gravitate to sex, violence, and suspense (and combinations thereof), and they are addicted to heightened reality. They do not have the patience for character studies, and that's why 'Once and Again' lasted only three seasons. One imagines that it was able to go that long because small but loyal numbers of viewers are actually bored by explosions, artificial suspense, and mindless exhibitionism. Now we have 'Once and Again' on DVD. I doubt there's ever been more genuine gratitude among fans of a TV show regarding its release on video. Sure, there are a lot of great shows on DVD, but they're usually high-rated products that stand to do a lot of volume on DVD and are no-brainers from a marketing perspective. (A lot of lousy ones make it to DVD, too, but does anyone really care about those?) We spent a long time wondering if 'O' would ever meet polycarbonate, then, later, believing that Season One would remain alone there. That would have been a shame. As good as the first season is as a stand-alone, it improves dramatically on subsequent viewings after seeing the second and third seasons. In the opening scene of the series, Lily Manning wakes her daughters in a middle-class home in a Chicago suburb. Beautiful morning sunlight streams through the windows. It's probably easy to dismiss it and think, "Okay, so what?" When you watch it after, say, "Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight?" from Season Two, you'll be prepared to understand. In Episode 5, "There Be Dragons," Jessie slips out of a movie outing with friends to take a walk by herself. She wanders around a mall looking at things, watching people, thinking. There's a wealth of suggestions on what's going through her mind, given the context of events in the episode. Watch it again after seeing "The Sex Show" from Season Three, and you'll find yourself filling in things that could not be suggested on network television in the earlier episode. What holds it all together and makes it so compelling is that 'Once and Again' isn't afraid to let all the main characters be smart, decent people. There are no moments of convenient stupidity that are allowed only because suspense must be maintained. People sometimes behave questionably or lash out angrily at one another, but it's seldom a surprise, because it usually happens under circumstances under which you'd expect it from the character. It's never a cop-out, either, because not a single main character in the series is one-notish. The strength of the actors is critical, because they are required to render subtle shadings and quick revelations that are necessary to make many scenes work but cannot be written into dialog. Fiction differs from reality in that it has had a narrative imposed on it by a writer, thus it is usually better able to illuminate human truths that are missing from an episode of 'Fear Factor' or 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' When you watch a television series in its original broadcast (or under other circumstances in which each episode is new to you), you can't know the full scope of the narrative that is taking shape in the minds of the writers, and they can do only so much to clue you in -- otherwise it just wouldn't be cool. This is no less true of 'Once and Again.' After you've seen every episode, going back and watching them over is synergistic. You can stand outside the constraints of the moment and understand where it really fits in the arc of the story, an omniscient third person. Would that we could do the same with our own lives. The other function of fictional writing is to provide dialog. (Would you want the contestants on 'Survivor' writing the dialog for the movie about your life?) 'Once and Again' is full of zingers, both dramatic and comedic, especially in the first season. Judy, Grace, and Zoe get most of the funniest lines, but the rest of the cast -- and sometimes even walk-ons -- have their share, too. Funny, ironic, and insightful, dialog like this works in several levels, and seeing them all springing to life at the same time is the real charm of 'Once and Again. 
i loved "my so-called life" and was expecting something good here, based on all these reviews. but the soap opera advertisements they stuck on the beginning of these DVDs were a bad omen. still, i hung in and hoped for the best. i was sitting there watching and really wondering "do people really relate to this stuff?" the characters on this show look like they're from JC penney catalogs, or ivory soap commercials. white bread, sanitary, vapid... thankfully all the people i know in real life are a million times more interesting than these fake people. this show makes me hope that i never have the bad fortune to make eyes with some guy in a parking lot and start dating him. the kids on this show are cute, but all kids are cute. nothing can save them or the adult characters or anyone from the extremely boring writing. i am SOOOOO glad that the world is nothing like how it's portrayed on this show. NEVER AGAIN!! 
When Once and Again first began I dismissed it as a show for just women. But after watching just one episode I found myself hooked. This was unlike any show I had seen before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well. With the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and Evan Rachel Wood. I am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on DVD and that they have finally decided to release Seasons 2 and 3 
This is one of the finest shows ever to be put on television+a prime example why network executives are ratings driven clueless morons. For a show of this calibre to be cancelled while dreck like Family Matters,Americas Funniest Home Videos+Full House are allowed to continue ad infinitim is unconscionable. Rarely has television see a presence as luminescent as Sela Ward--I am beyond thrilled that she is back on TV in "House". The story of two broken families trying to pick up the pieces and find happiness again is done so well it is almost heartbreaking. Adults+children are given mature storylines+allowed to excel--especially Julia Whelan+Evan Rachel Ward. Ward especially is as revelation--more so in season 2 where she is given as story line that should have won her an Emmy. Shows like this are the reason TV was created. The 3 seasons of this show contain more real heart and drama than a 7-10 year run of the crap on today. This is probably the finest ensemble drama since St.Elsewhere. I would give it 10 stars if I coul 
I ordered this dvd set as a birthday present to myself, and I wasn't disapointed. The new print of "The Searchers" with all the extras(lobby cards,reprint of the dell comic, and not to mention the documentaries make this a fantastic dvd set-- In addition you get a two dvd set for Stagecoach(which started the Ford/Wayne partnership),Fort Apache,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,3 Godfaters,They Were Expendable,Wings Of Eagles, and The Long Voyage Home. The only thing I would have chaged is that I would have made almost All the movies in this set westerns(The Searchers,Stagecoach,Fort Apache,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,Rio Grande,3 Godfathers,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Quiet Man(which isn't a western, but I think it fits in well)would have been my choice for the set. That aside I think all the movies in this set are great and any fan of John Ford(or John Wayne)will not be disappointed. 
THE JOHN WAYNE JOHN FORD FILM COLLECTION is the finest DVD boxed set I have bought all year. It has almost nothing but masterpieces--not just great westerns, but great non-westerns like the Merchant Marine drama THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940), based on a few Eugene O'Neill one-act plays; and the World War Two PT boat adventure THEY WERE EXPENDABLE (1945), one of the great war films of all time. One watches this set over two weeks and comes away with renewed respect for John Wayne as an outstanding actor, but also downright awe for John Ford as a director. Not the nicest person, but boy could he direct westerns in Monument Valley. And the Ireland of THE QUIET MAN (1952), which is not included in this set--wrong studio. The set's crown jewel is the 50th anniversary remastering of THE SEARCHERS (1956), which includes not just a shimmering transfer of this dark and tragic masterpiece, but also a rare comic book, publicity material, lobby cards, and an audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich. Ethan Edwards, post Civil War loner and indian hater when his niece is kidnapped and killed by Comanches, may be John Wayne's greatest performance in a sea of great performances in this DVD crown jewels box. But a little bit of Hank Worden's and Ken Curtis' unwelcome comedy relief goes a long way. I personally think STAGECOACH (1939), with Wayne's first important role as the Ringo Kid, is the equal to THE SEARCHERS. It has also been remastered and includes an audio commentary by author Scott Eyman, an "American Masters" documentary on both Wayne and Ford, a new documentary on STAGECOACH as a neglected treasure, and a radio production with Randolph Scott and Claire Trevor. The movie is about nine people traveling by stagecoach through indian territory and features an Oscar-winning score by Max Steiner--the same year he did not win for GONE WITH THE WIND! The dusty B FORT APACHE (1948) and brilliant Technicolor SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON (1949) make up 2/3 of John Ford's Cavalry trilogy with Wayne at his peak. (Part three, RIO GRANDE, is not included here because it is a different studio). APACHE has a nasty Henry Fonda as an indian-hating Commanding Officer of Fort Apache in Utah's Monument Valley. Wayne is his likeable subordinate who must carry out orders he personally disagrees with in a role that mirrors THE SEARCHERS. YELLOW RIBBON may be my personal favorite Ford Monument Valley western, even more than THE SEARCHERS. It has Wayne as a Commanding Officer about to retire after a lifetime of Army service, but not until unfriendly nearby indians settle down. Winton Hoch's magnificent color photography, inspired by Remington paintings, won a richly-deserved Oscar. Also set in Ford's beloved Monument Valley, but not a Cavalry drama, is the Technicolor 3 GODFATHERS (1949). It has Wayne, Pedro Armendariz, and newcomer Harry Carey, Jr. as outlaws out in the desert who come across an abandoned baby at Christmas time. This story is the third version of a movie done previously in 1929 and 1936 in B I've seen all three versions and like Ford's the best. It also stars Ford regular Ward Bond as a sheriff out to get the three men--but with a wife who wants the baby. This is a pleasantly sentimental movie, often shown on cable at Christmas season, and reveals a soft side of a gruff filmmaker. The last of eight treasures in this Ford and Wayne DVD set is the lightweight (and color) THE WINGS OF EAGLES (1957). It is the true story of Commander Frank "Spig" Wead, a pioneer aviator in the 1920's and later screenwriter in the 1930's and 1940's. One of his finest scripts is for Ford's THEY WERE EXPENDABLE in 1945. EAGLES, also starring Dan Dailey and Maureen O'Hara, is the sentimental and labor of love story of Spig Wead's life over several decades. Almost all of these film classics come with an original theatrical trailer, if you want to see how the movies were originally promoted. That especially interests me when masterpieces like THE SEARCHERS, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME, and THEY WERE EXPENDABLE get shut out of the Oscar race, especially for Picture and Wayne's performance. But, as they say, time is the key factor with movies. And people still want to see these Ford/Wayne movie gems, long after even Best Picture Oscar winners are forgotten. Should you buy or rent these from Netflicks? It is an expensive set, in the $55-$75 range. But if you buy the set, it averages out to only about $8 a picture, a ridiculously great buy. Maybe it can be a Christmas present. Happy viewing!  
Excellent movies with one that previously wasn't available (Wings of Eagles), and the best western ever made (The Searchers). They don't get any better than this, the quentesential JW/JF set 
I recommend this DVD set for anyone even halfway interested in John Wayne and/or John Ford films. Great editions of eight classic or near classic films, at least a couple not available until now, a very cool 2-disc edition of "The Searchers", and a remastered 2-disc set of "Stagecoach". All for a little over $50! Particularly impressive - "They Were Expendable", the WW II PT Boat story. Good acting from top to bottom, great black and white film work, and really good, stirring, special effects in a couple of spots. Also, "The Three Godfathers", a mystical John Wayne western? Interesting. Only confusing omission - no "The Quiet Man", also a Ford/Wayne project. ??? I guess you've always got to leave something off to keep the customer interested. And come to think of it, "Rio Grande" was also not included, so obviously you can't have everything. Side Note: Typical great service from Amazon. 
We were extremely pleased with all the DVDs included in this collection - more than we had expected. There is also a bonus collection of photos of the cast during shooting of Stagecoach that is priceless 
The two icons of motion picture. May be the best duo ever, (director and actor). Now for the collection itself. 1). The Searchers. This is Wayne's best preformance ever(by the way he can act)and one of(MAY BE THE BEST)the best western ever. Wayne can be brutal and then commpassionet. The supporting cast is also excellent,Jeffery Hunter, Natlie Wood, Ward Bond and Vera Miles. 2). Stagecoach, 1939 (What a year for motion pictures).John Ford made John Wayne a household name by casting Wyne in the lead in this film. Wayne's introduction in the film is the best ever on screen. The camera is out of focus when it draws in on Wayne then comes back into focus(a mistake,but left in by Ford)outstanding. Then you have Thomas Mitchell's oscar winning preformance and the beautifal Clair Treavor. 3). Fort Apache The BEST in the calvary trilogy and the first time on dvd. Henry Fonda as the commander(another of John Ford's favorite actors)with devistating affects. Fonda is obsessed with with getting the apache and Cochise back on the reservation at any cost. Wayne is caught in the middle. Fonda is a (George Amstrong Custard) in many ways. 4). She Wore A Yellow Ribbon. I think that this is one of Ford's best. And another great preformance by John Wayne. An ageing officer trying to avoid more bloodshed in his last few weeks of service. This is a masterpiece. 5). 3 Godfathers Fugitive bank robbers are chased by a posse and are forced to the desert. There they find a dying woman and her newborn. They make a promise to the dying women that they can't go back on. They won't abandon the baby. Great story telling. 6). The Wings Of Eagles, The true story of Cmdr. Frank "Spig" Wead an aviation pioneer and writer. Maureen O'Hara and Dan Dailey co-star. Real battle footage. 7). The Long Voyage Home. Wayne's follow up to Stagecoach. This film was nominated for six Academy Awards. The crewmen on this ship search the sky for German planes, while in the North Atlantic and hope they survive. One of the best American films about life at sea. And 8). They Were Expendable PT-Boat action at it's best. World War 2 at it bleakest hours. The defenders of the Philippines and John Wayne and Robert Montgomery as PT-Boat commanders, try to give the U.S. war effort time to regroup after the devastion of Pearl Harbor. Story telling at its finest. 
John Wayne is one of my all-time favorite stars and this collection has a number of his best 
This DVD set might have garnered 6 stars, if only it had included THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE--terrible oversight not to have added it 
The Searchers is probably my favorite John Wayne movies. It has many levels of understanding ,from a simple western adventure to the soul searching and life changing events we all have. 
This is a must for all those that love John Wayne movies...a nice selection all in one package 
I am surprised that more folks haven't reviewed this DVD. There are no frills or fancy effects -- true to JJ's style, this is a simple documentary that reveals the essence of Cale and his music. Tons of great photographs and interviews walks us through Cale's childhood, how he became famous and most importantly an insight into Cale. I have tremendous respect for how generously Eric Clapton praised Cale and mentioned that Cale is his is "favorite person" in the world. A must have for Cale fans. For others, this is your chance to discover his music. In our current world of sub standard musicians and ostentation, here is a TRUE AMERICAN MUSIC LEGEND 
To Tulsa and Back is a well made documentary of an awesome artist. You will hear great music, see great photography, and experience history. You will see why Eric Clapton loves J.J. Cale. 
Great music for the master of under statement, a real insight on what it's like to be on the road, keep on doin' it. Cale has it all he is the complete package and a realy nice guy two. We would all like to be in his band and play his fantastic tunes. Very good 
Cale is famous for shunningthe spotlight so thats what makes this DVD Documentary such a pure joy. You really get to know all about the man who wrote some of Claptons biggest songs (Cocaine, After Midnight) thru watching him play live, talk and return home to Tulsa where is all began. Lots a great extras as well thru discussions with friends and family. This is a must buy for anyone interested in what its like to be an artist on the road and how it all works as well 
I bought this movie and loved it for the sheer wierdness of seeing three academy award winning actors in a movie about meat grinding humans and drugged runaways sold as sex slaves. I noticed if Lee doesn't have much to say in a scene his upper lip hangs down on his face. You can see it for the first time in "The Killers" where he intentionally got totally drunk before his dying hitman character kills Ron Reagan. As his career progresses, his scenes where his character isn't doing much you can see the hanging upper lip. You can also see it The Professionals. In the opening scenes of this movie where the mob boss is laying down the mission to Lee it can be seen again. 
Being from Kansas City I'm always interested in any cinema shot here, especially since there are so very few movies made in this part of the country. When I learned about the existence of this movie with Gene Hackman and Lee Marvin I had to see it. I added the DVD to my collection and what can say? This movie and it's implications are almost beyond my comprehension; if this is truly how Hollywood sees the midwest, I am thrilled! Man-butchering ganster farmers, drug controlled sex slaves on the auction block, nordic looking homo-erotic henchmen, groin-punching good times between manical brothers, and Hackman's "Mary Ann" character riding high on a wave of murderous lunacy declaring his love of eating guts! The mind boggles under the weight of this grindhouse style masterpiece that makes "Blue Velvet" look like "The Santa Clause"! In spite of all of this glorious surrealism, the only improvement I could possibly suggest would be that it should have been a musical. I will swear to my dying day that if this movie would have had some lavish musical numbers no one would have ever even thought twice about "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". If Lee Marvin could have done that dreadful "Paint Your Wagon" movie, he could have been up to the task of turning this macabre little film into a up-roar that college kids would still be quoting every day. This film should be required viewing for anyone even thinking about coming to this part of the country. I'm going to go do my part to live up to this film's dipiction of KC by putting on my mother's wedding dress and making sausage out of whatever isn't fast enough to escape my grasp! Vivo el Meatpackers 
I saw this movie quite a few years ago (probably about 15 or 20 years ago). I must say the first time I saw it I wasn't really impressed. Then I read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that Marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie. So when it was released on DVD I went out and purchased it. I remember little about it from the first time other than it had Sissy Spacek in it in one of her first roles, if not her very first big screen role. I must say that I didn't find this movie any better now than I did then. I appreciate Marvins career and his acting as well as Gene Hackman. These two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good. The story could have been much better and the core of it is good. Marvin is a respected Chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by Eddie Egan (the real Popeye Doyle from the French Connection drug bust in New York) to collect $500,000 that an associate name Mary Ann has forgotten to pay. Mary Ann (Gene Hackman... and don't ask me why he is Mary Ann cause they never explain it) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house. He has sent back several other bag men to the Chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them. Mary Ann also is now with Marvins old flame Clarabell (Jeez what is with these stupid names?). Mary Ann also deals in white slavery, enter Sissy Spacek. He sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows. This is an interesting novelty kind of movie. If you are a fan of Marvin or Hackman check it out. Even if you are a fan of Sissy Spacek. But alas this movie is just not that good. The old school mob vs the new middle America mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie. 
I often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like "Prime Cut". You would be hard pressed to find a dumber story, plot line or set of characters. This is almost a purposeful testament to all that was worse with the 70's "Lew Wasserman" type production deals 
Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin), an enforcer for the Chicago Mob, is sent to Kansas City to collect a debt from a rancher and meat packer named Mary Ann (Gene Hackman). Mary Ann was sent by the mob to run things down there and now claims the fiefdom as his own. Previous enforcers were dealt with in a way appropriate to Mary Ann's chosen industry. Nick takes his trusted driver and three mob goons with him to collect the money. Upon their arrival, they find Mary Ann presiding over a livestock auction, but the livestock in this auction is the meat packer's second source of income, prostitution. Nick rescues Poppy (Sissy Spacek), a drugged out young woman, and they leave. Neither Nick or Mary Ann will give in to the other, leaving only one conclusion. "Prime Cut" directed by Michael Ritchie, and made in 1972, is a new film for me. Recently, Ebert and Roeper featured a number of Lee Marvin films new to DVD. I have never been a fan of Marvin, but the films looked intriguing so I gave a few a try and also revisited "The Professionals", one of my favorite films starring Burt Lancaster and Lee Marvin. It is important to remember that the film was made in 1972 because it strikes the viewer as dated. Shortly after Nick rescues Poppy, he buys her a dress (she was naked at the livestock auction) and they go to dinner at the fancy restaurant in his hotel. Poppy's new dress does little to hide her breasts, but she seems blissfully unaware as the older men and women in the restaurant stare at her. All the time, Nick and Poppy ignore them, trying to have a conversation. Everything about this scene screams early 70s to me, from their conversation to the `subtle' look at class. Later in the film, Nick and his goons arrange to meet Mary Ann at the local county fair and collect the money. This sequence is introduced with a series of close ups of a man walking on stilts, children laughing, etc., all meant to disorient the viewer before letting them become familiar with the new setting. Again, very 70s. There are many sequences in the film which are strange, unusual and interesting, ultimately making the film worth watching. From the opening sequence; Mary Ann's demented brother, Weenie (Gregory Walcott) gets rid of one of the mob's enforcers (perhaps the most memorable scene), to a harvesting machine chasing Nick and Poppy through a corn field, Ritchie seems to be paying homage to Hitchcock and it works. The action scenes are interesting and hold your attention. Even the scene set in the corn field, which is close enough to be called a rip off of the famous chase from Hitchcock's "North By Northwest"; Ritchie adds a little touch at the end to make it memorable and interesting. You won't be able to stop watching it. When the story turns to more sedate matters and everything relies on the actors, the film is less successful. Marvin seems to have been most comfortable portraying mobsters, generals and cowboys throughout his career. His demeanor is well-suited for these types of roles. He merely has to stare at most men and they will surrender. This persona works well with this character. But when Nick is supposed to be human, it doesn't work. When Nick takes Poppy to dinner, it isn't clear if Nick is trying to romance Poppy or become her supportive "Uncle". She clearly seems to be flirting with him but Nick doesn't seem to return the favor. Thankfully. At this point Marvin was 47 (Wow, he looks older. But I guess he always did.) and Spacek was 22. Not very age appropriate. This scene works if Poppy is flirting with Nick; he has just saved her from a life of prostitution and her life has been pretty screwed up to that point. But it would be creepy to watch Marvin's Nick putting the moves on the younger actress. Gene Hackman is always interesting to watch. A villain with the name Mary Ann is going to have to be fairly menacing. Hackman follows occasional outbursts with a quick smile or joke, trying to hide his true menace. This performance reminded me exactly of Lex Luthor and makes this character seem all the more like a dry run for the villain he would play in the "Superman" films beginning in 1978. Sissy Spacek is good, in her first starring role, but the part is a very traditional take on the female sidekick so prevalent in action films. For a great performance, check out her later work in "In The Bedroom". "Prime Cut" is a memorable exercise in action filmmaking. Two sequences from the film will stay with me for a long time. Can you figure out which ones? 
This is a great Lee Marvin classic with lots of pace. Script is excellent and Lee plays his part as the done wrong gangster to the hilt. As good as some of the Dirty Harry movies. Rent it before buying to be on the safe side 
What rubbish. Ridiculous situations, and poor writing doom this boring, stupid film. Probably, the worst film that starred either Lee Marvin or Gene Hackman. A real hack job that was meant to snare unsuspecting theater goers who liked the stars 
I was looking for the new release of "Point Blank" at my local retail DVD buffet and they didn't have it so, finding "Prime Cut" instead (which I'd never seen) I bought it kind of as a consolation prize; but I was disappointed because I'd been looking for something with the kooky, flashy, noir-weirdness "Point Blank" offered. Grudgingly, I popped this in and, within the first few minutes of the movie, I realized that "Prime Cut" is definitely weirder than "Point Blank." Somehow, I'd forgotten this was a Michael Ritchie film, made just after "Downhill Racer" and just before he really swung in with "The Candidate," "Smile," "The Bad News Bears" and "Semi-Tough." We begin with a graphic tour of a slaughterhouse, through which a diced Chicago hood is processed into hot dogs by a guy named Weenie who wouldn't look out of place in the back of a panel of "Sin City." Then there are the barnyard pens of wasted, naked sex slaves drooled over by Kansas City moneymen. Presiding over it all is a hairy Gene Hackman, chuckling and shoveling hog guts from a plate into his usual sideways grin. Lee Marvin, looking cut from salmon-toned marble, marches through the whole thing like he's the only character who's already read the script and knows every single decision he needs to make. This is a movie that asks us to root against the upstart country boy who defies the mob, to favor the tough-as-railroad-ties mafia enforcer. He wades into the sticks to smack the machine so it'll work right again. And we do. Sure, the movie has it's problems. There are *lots* of obvious visual metaphors for the way big systems process little things into profitable distortions (none of which trump the slaughterhouse credit sequence). And the women are mostly helpless, have a tendency to get assaulted but bounce right back at the sight of a shopping bag full of clothes. The final shoot-out drags a bit during the sunflower field scene. And, as for the film's signature chase scene -- Marvin and Sissy Spacek flee a gigantic thresher as it chases them across an open wheat field -- I couldn't ignore two thoughts: 1) Why don't they just double-back and run around behind the thing, which cannot easily turn and 2) They could run faster if they weren't holding hands. Still, this is a weird, wild, underseen gem, a colorful thriller, almost like an inverted Travis McGee adventure, or like a particularly demented Don Siegel picture. You (or at least *I*) have to love a crime thriller that takes a five minute time-out while the two main badguys play grabass in a kitchen, wrestling around like teenaged brothers. This was a movie that made me perfectly happy to temporarily miss "Point Blank." 
Though short of classic status, "Prime Cut" has alot to recommend it. Director Michael Ritchie has a sharp eye for Middle-America ambience and stages some good action set pieces. Lee Marvin is in classic tough guy form as Devlin, the bagman sent by the Chicago bosses to collect a debt from sleazy Mary Ann(Gene Hackman), whose Kansas City meat plant is a front for a more lucrative trade in white slavery and narcotics. Hackman, in what is in essence an extended cameo, makes a colorful impression here. Sissy Spacek, as a girl entrapped in Hackman's operation, isn't really given much to do in her film debut but is easy on the eyes in a fresh-faced kind of way. The film breezes by at an economical 86 minutes. Interesting casting here with Gregory Walcott("Plan 9 from Outer Space" infamy) as Hackman's brother and Eddie Egan(the real-life inspiration for Popeye Doyle of "The French Connection" fame) as a Chicago mob boss 
Well, I sure could have skipped this one. I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me. Mostly, I was just plain bored. There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks. Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President. And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie. But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter. 
Though 'Primary' introduced the political campaigning doco, 'The War Room' surely is the apex of the genre. Part of the highlight of the doco is Stephanopoulos, who is captured as he is - preening himself and agreeing with others ideas/suggestions. As with the Clinton campaign, Carville steals the show. Whatever your convictions (and mine are on the other side of politics) it is impossible not to respect Carville for his character and beliefs. I dont want to spoil it for you, but Billary wins.. 
While I found the glimpses into the inner workings of the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton to be interesting and well worth watching, it was a bit disappointing. Campaign manager James Carville and Communications Director George Stephanopoulos demonstrate their skills at political maneuvering. Even though Bill Clinton was a masterful politician, these two men got him elected. While both of them show their hard-boiled political fronts, they also show their human sides. Stephanopoulos openly talks about how nervous he is and Carville cries when he thanks the staff for their hard work. There are two main weaknesses to the presentation. The first is that many parts will be incomprehensible to anyone who does not already know a great deal about the events. For example, there is mention of the relationship between Carville and Mary Matalin, but it is never truly explained. The incongruity of the political strategists of Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican George Bush having a romantic relationship in the middle of a presidential campaign is not emphasized as much as it should. If you were not aware of the depth of that relationship and who they are, then that segment will be little more than a flyby. The second main weakness is that your perspective never reaches the level of the "fly on the wall." At all times, it is clear that you are seeing into the campaign only to the extent that they want you to see. It would have been better if they at least sometimes made it appear that you were seeing workings of the campaign staff that they would have preferred not be seen. I was especially disappointed with the response to the Gennifer Flowers incident. Clinton and his campaign staff handled it very deftly, yet we really don't see what they did. This contrasts with an incident later in the campaign when Stephanopoulos fields a call from someone who is threatening to expose what they claim is another Clinton infidelity. In this case, he supposedly fathered a child with a black woman. Stephanopoulos tells the person politely but firmly that: *) At this point no one cares. *) If you break the story, you will never work in the Democratic party again. I found this video fascinating, but I remembered and understood the events that unfolded. If you for any reason do not know the fundamentals of what is happening, then you will spend a great deal of time puzzled by what you see. 
WHAT IS THE WAR ROOM? What we have here is a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes activities of the Clinton for President election team effort during the 1992 presidential race, centering around "The War Room" [the campaign headquarters]. This documentary begins at the New Hampshire primary and ends with Clinton's victory. WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT? We are shown the difficulties the Clinton campaign had in dealing with an avalanche of negative press. How they essentially continued effectively implementing their strategic election plan while simultaneously minimizing the damage to Clinton's credibility caused by his emerging image as a draft-dodger and an adulterer is simply amazing to see. This small epic is quite interesting but knowing how it all ends takes away some of the much deserved suspense and awe. Sure there are scandals for Mr. Clinton and we have the accuser admitting that it was the Republican party that put her up to it. We also have a candidate in Clinton that seemed to have no chance to get the support of his party, let alone win the election. Maybe when the film came out 11 years ago it had more weight. After all this was all one great big surprise and these were current events. However, today my attention went to James Carville who seemed the most genuine and able participant within the war room. We also got a good look at George Stephanopoulos whose presence gave a nice contrast to Carville. I found myself wishing that Carville and Stephanopoulos had been the candidates as they both seemed more sincere and public service oriented than the actual candidates. Naturally it does not work that way, but that is how the film affected me 5 years after the end of the Clinton presidency. HISTORY AS IT HAPPENED! This is a true documentary and appears to be fairly objective in depicting how the people who made up the winning political machine in 1992 functioned. This team functioned quite well in overcoming seemingly impossible hurdles which we can now witness as they were happening. In effect, we get to see a rather significant slice of political history as it happened. SOME FINAL THOUGHTS: This delightful film is not like "JFK" or some of Michael Moore's films in that it is not fictionalized to entertain and convince at the expense of truth. Charismatic Hollywood actors are never used in place of the real people to foster credibility and empathy. Simply stated, "The War Room" is closer to reality than many of us are use to seeing in film. While it does not have the polish of a "JFK" or the raw emotional impact of a "Fahrenheit 9/11", "The War Room" is much closer to objective truth and therefore extremely worthwhile 
The 1992 presidential campaign may seem like eons ago, but "The War Room" brings it all back. The movie focuses on Clinton's aggressive key operatives, in particular the blunt, unconventional James Carville, whose lack of social graces is balanced by a searing intelligence and ruthless political instinct, and the smooth-talking, telegenic George Stephanopoulos. Adding to the drama is the unlikely romance between Carville and Mary Matalin, George Bush the elder's chief campaign adviser. "War Room" is a vivid glimpse into the back-room wheeling and dealing which fuels the modern democratic process. 
This is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning. One does not need to love the results of these changes (I personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it, even as I marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election) to appreciate how Clinton's 1992 campaign, as seen in this film, changed the American political world. "War Room" should be seen along with more recent documentaries (like, for example, "Staffers '04") to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal (to be elected rather than to govern). Hopefully, it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless, mind-numbing, dumbing down assessments of candidate traits (like "character" or "integrity") we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years 
"The War Room", a film by Chris Hegedus and Da Pennebaker gives you unfettered access to the strategists of the 92' campaign to elect Bill Clinton and Al Gore. The film doesn't have many appearances by President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, but that's not the point. The film shows you just how the campaign was won, the emotions that were felt and the ups and downs of running this campaign. This film gives you an inside look at the truly revolutionary way in which this historic campaign was won. The spotlight is on several star strategists of the Democratic Party such as James Carville, George Stephanopoulos and Paul Begala; all of whom are regulars on CNN's Crossfire. The film is similar to many other notable documentaries on political campaigns (such as Journeys with George), but the emphasis is on those in charge the campaign, you see into their everyday work lives. The reason why this film was so successful in it's portrayal of campaigning is: this hadn't been done before. The film makers were looked at as "friend" not a foe trying to get a story for the evening news. The film makers are party to strategy meetings and every aspect of the campaign. As stated in the DVD introduction, this film's historical significance changes everyday as history and current events change. It's and excellent film and if you like political documentaries, I suggest you give this a try 
I found this to be a collection of superficial soundbites. If a person is a fan of the major players they might enjoy seeing the interplay between them but for me this documentary is a bore 
This is a must have in your collection Sondheim fans! This box set has titles that appeal to both the children and adults in a family. My children love Into the woods and the Carnegie Hall concert especially! One of the best purchases I've made this year 
I have been in love with the work of Stephen Sondheim since the age of 6, when I first memorized the lyrics to all of the songs from West Side Story. Mr. Sondheim has give us many, many wonderful pieces of theatre, and several of his best pieces are represented here. Sweeney Todd: considered by many his masterpiece. I prefer the Angela Lansbury / George Hearn casting, but if they chose to star Betty Boop and Donald Duck it couldn't hurt this material. Brilliant. Follies in Concert: Follies remains my favorite Sondheim musical and, unlike some other reviewers, I thought the ORIGINAL book was brilliant. The later revised version considerably weakened both characters and plot, and the "concert" version is even more woefully incomplete than the original cast album, but thank GOD they saw fit to include, "Too Many Mornings". Sunday In The Park With George: Pulitzer Prize winning paean to the creative process; I can even forgive the casting of Mandy Patinkin, one of my least favorite actors. The recreation of Seurat's masterpiece during the first act climax still gives me chills. Passion: the more I watch this achingly beautiful show, the more I think it's one of Sondheim's greatest scores. Subtle, yes, but if you allow it to, it will grow and grow on you until you can't get it out of your mind. This show is for anyone who has ever loved someone that they couldn't have. Into The Woods: I saw both Broadway productions and had difficulty choosing which was better. I think the original cast, represented here, had a slight edge. Possibly the most "fun" of Sondheim's shows, this take on Grimm's fairy tales is clever, entertaining and highly satisfying. The Carnegie Hall tribute is also wonderful. I have long been of the opinion that Sondheim can do no wrong. His lyrics are thrillingly brilliant, witty beyond all expectations, and his music contains depth that other Broadway composers can only dream of. What is most amazing to me is how he can vary styles and musical periods from show to show to show - no two of his musicals are ever alike, which is more than I can say for many other composers. I don't understand those who like him only to a point; I have friends who love Sweeny, Follies and Night Music, but hate Sunday, Passion and Into the Woods. I think he gets better with each succeeding show. This set is well worth the investment. Hurry and get it, as some of the individual videos are now unavailable, and who knows how long the boxed set will last. 
Sondheim is the master. He is the best of the best. That said, this is a collection of some of his finest work that exists on DVD. Follies... while not the most desireable representation of the show (it's very cut down) you still get Barbara Cook's stirring "Losing My Mind," Elaine Stritch's dry and perfect "Broadway Baby," and Carol Burnett's "I'm Still Here," which is a religeous experience. The documentary is quite interesting, as well! Passion: My favorite Sondheim score. The music is lush and beautiful. The characters are real and fascinating. The dialogue is poetry. It's an amazing show with an amazing score, and amazing performances given by amazing actors. Sunday in the Park: Anyone with any interest in art of any form should see this musical. It's a wonderful look at the creation of art and the process of creating. It has a strong message of finding "something new, something of your own." This is a strong, powerful musical about going against the odds for the sake of art, and not giving the masses what they want (something Sondheim does marvelously and brilliantly). Sweeney Todd: The greatest musical ever written. It's about murder and cannibalism. Well, the plot, at least. The show is about revenge and love and obsession and all of this is reflected so beautifully in the amazingly huge score. To hear this score played by a Symphony orchestra, sung by an opera ensemble and with such a fantastic mix of opera and musical theatre stars is heaven. George Hearn IS Sweeney Todd, and Patti LuPone recreates Mrs. Lovett as her own with brilliant acting and singing. Neil Patrick Harris, Lisa Vroman, Standford Olsen also bring magic and beauty to this production. Celebration at Carnegie Hall: Such a loving mix of well-known and obscure Sondheim performed by the best. Too many highlights to name, and wonderful new arrangements. Any Sondheim fan should own this, and anyone who watches it will soon be a Sondheim fan. This concert shows why he is considered the greatest musical theatre composer of the 20th century (and in my opinion, ever) 
Happy Christmas! Wow. Somebody loves me. What a spectaular gift. Each of these shows is a gem. The concert offers Madeline Kahn singing "Getting Married Today" (I just adored her). The Sondheim/Lapine shows are three of the masters best efforts - "Sunday in the Park," "Into the Woods" and "Passion." Great performances on each of these discs - Bernadette Peters, Mandy Patinkin, Donna Murphy, Marin Mazzie, Glenn Close, Comedn and Green, Elaine Stritch and Barbara Cook - and many more. Anyone who loves the musical theatre would be thrilled and delighted to have this collection 
would rate the show as 5 stars, this is a review of the extras and features of the Special Edition issue. I recently bought all the Special Edition releases of "Stand Alone Complex" after trying to research what I was going to get as extras not included in the regular edition. I found the listings on Amazon's product details to be a little confusing and incomplete on some of the volumes so I decided to write this guide for others trying to decide. I'm not going to review the "Ghost in the Shell" episodes or the series in general because there are so many excellent reviews already on this site, and most of you probably know about this great anime TV series already. There are various other reviews that say that some of the DVD's and CD's have errors on them and Bandai will replace them with corrected discs if you send them in for exchange. I have not ran into problems yet, although I haven't gone through the whole series either. And I will also state that I love the TV series as well as both movies, but I would recommend the Imported Region 2 version of GITS2:Innocence if you have a region free DVD player. Dreamworks really messed up that release omiting the English dub and putting Hard of Hearing subtitles instead of regular ones on the early issues of that movie. Most people find them very distracting and annoying. First off the discs themselves, you get two DVD discs in each volume with the same episodes on both discs. Volumes 1-5 have 4 episodes each, 6 and 7 have 3 episodes each making 26 episodes total in the series. Both discs are Anamorphic wide screen encoded directly from the High-Definition Masters. Both Discs also have English subtitles. Each set also has two interviews with voice cast or someone associated with the production of the anime, and a printed DVD insert pamphlet or booklet with different interviews and such for each volume. All discs are Region 1. Disc one has Dolby Digital 5.1 in Japanese and English, and Dolby Digital 2.0 in English and Japanese. Disc two has DTS 5.1 in English and Japanese and a Dolby Digital 2.0 English track. Volumes 1 and 2 include soundtrack CD's of the music of Yoko Kanno, the most excellent and versatile composer of the music in the TV series. Anime lovers know her work from the many fine soundtracks that she's done for countless other anime movies and TV series. Volume 3 has a Black XL Fruit of the Loom Tee-Shirt with the section 9 logo on the front and a Major Kusanagi graphic on the back. Nice shirt! Volumes 4 and 5 have a collectable I.D. cards for a section 9 member. Volume 6 has a Black XL Fruit of the Loom Tee-Shirt with the section 9 logo on the front and a Batou graphic on the back, and another I.D. card. Nice shirt again! Volume 7 has another Tee-Shirt! This time it's a White XL with the section 9 logo on the front, and the Laughing Man logo on the back! Once again nice shirt! It also comes with a tin box that's supposed to hold all 7 volumes of the DVD set. I was excited about getting the box but when it arrived I was disappointed with the design. It's kind of like the rectangular lunch box that you used to take to school as a kid, without the handle and latch. Its also of a thinner metal that dents easily. It has marketing type of printing on the backside that pertains to vol. 7 only, and the DVD cases stack inside one on top of the other. The spines of the cases are not visible when you open the box, only the front of the last case you put in. So you have to take all the cases out of the tin to get to a specific volume. There's also not room for the cardboard sleves that the DVD's were in when you got the individual volumes, and no room for the soundtrack CD's either. All said, I was disappointed with the box. Because of it's odd dimensions it doesn't stack in well with my DVD library. I would have much preferred the normal five sided box that usually comes with DVD sets. Overall I'd say it's worth it to buy volumes 3, 6 and 7 new to get the shirts if they interest you and pick up the others used if you can to save some money on the series. That is if you're interested in the DTS soundtrack options. I much prefer the DTS mixes to Dolby Digital and wanted the soundtrack CD's as well. Also the cardboard boxes that come with volumes 3 and 6 are better than the tin box to store your set in when you complete the series, if you stack them on shelves one row of DVD's on top of another row, and you can fit the movies into those boxes as well to fill them the rest of the way 
I'll admit to you that I love to watch Adult Swim, and I'll also admit that I like certain types of anime. No, I'm not one of those nerdy card-trading Poke'mon lovers, I'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time. I like anime that's made for adults like: Big O!, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Tenchi and Ghost in the shell. I was watching either watching Family Guy or Aqua Teen Hunger Force when I saw previews for this show start to air on Adult Swim, I thought thought it looked cool, it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal, But I didn't know the half of it. What I got was a cyber-punk version of the old black-and-white film noir mysteries. The series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public. In the story, 'stand alone complex' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal, or in other words, an imaginary criminal. It also refers to the structure of each episode: Each episode can be viewed independently of each other, and there is little catch-up (if at all) given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date. Taking place in a fictional city of Japan called "Niihama-shi" (New Port City) in the year 2030, Stand Alone Complex tells the story of a special operations task-force called Public Security Section 9, or simply "Section 9". The series follows the exploits of Section 9's agents who range from ex-military to ex-police as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level, eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as "The Laughing Man". Public Security Section 9 is an elite domestic anti-crime unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of technology-related acts of terrorism and crime. Their duties include response to serious cyber crimes (i.e. Cyberbrain hacking, cyber-terrorism), investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases. From time-to-time they also serve as protection to foreign VIPs. If you have seen the movie then you know that the TV series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology. Instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology, presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole. The series of 26 half-hour TV episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga. In comparison to the film version, the series is considered by many to be easier to understand. Also, in comparison, the series can be found to be closer to the manga; due to the presence of some humor, the usage of the Tachikomas (Fuchikomas in the manga, and referred to simply as "tanks" in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in), the design of the characters, and also, the usage of the characters Paz, Bouma and Saito. Stand Alone Complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of Production I.G. in their application of computer generated imagery. This is evident in their digital color grading, environmental effects, and cell-shaded computer models. Their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene, which adds greatly to the atmosphere. I think a lot of people will try to compare this to Cowboy Bebop as with so many other anime and mangas, but that's foolish. Stand Alone Complex is no better or worse than Cowboy Bebop, it's just a different story, different style, different sets of charactors and there places. if you like anime or manga you'll definitely like this show. It's complex, has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it, and not to mention the technology! Even if you don't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is. 
I've heard a lot of complaints about the storyline, and a lot of complaints about how the DVDs are sold and the number of episodes... The story is very complex, it is. There's no getting around it. Even the Japanese feel that it's complex, and have you had a good look at their written language lately? I for one love the series, and I'm a big fan of Production IG's work, and Masamune Shirow-sensei's work, especially his more well-known works; Koukaku Kidoutai (Ghost in The Shell), and Appleseed. As for the price of the DVDs and the number of episodes, I'm a fan of DVDs having fewer episodes, or atleast using as much of the disc as possible. I compared my Japanese DVDs with my American ones and found something startling; The Japanese DVDs, which have just 2 episodes, and cost roughly $60 US, utilize more than 7gb of the disc. The American DVD which has 4 episodes, English audio, and sells for $20-45 (Depending on edition) uses a hair over 6gb. Are you being ripped off? Yes. Is it because of the number of episodes? No. A 26 episode series has to be something like 5-5-5-5-3-3, or 5-5-4-4-4-4, or in this case 4-4-4-4-4-3-3, otherwise the last volume would have a very small number of episodes. And THAT they cannot sell. Personally, I wish they'd just put all the extras on the last disc, because then the DTS disc would be irrelevant, the normal disc could have DTS. But I'm willing to bet the average American consumer would still pitch a fit over a DVD with just 1-2 episodes and a bunch of interviews. If you want to feel ripped off, don't do it because of the way the episodes are distributed, feel ripped off because they're putting 4 episodes on the DVD and still fail to use more disc space than the Japanese 2-episode DVDs. Which is a ridiculous thing, since once you break the 4.5gb mark, whether you use 4.51gb or 8.5gb it still costs the same amount to manufacture, so why didn't they fill the disc? This, while not a 'lack' of bandwidth, still leads to lowered visual quality in comparison to the original Japanese DVDs. Oh, and if you still want to complain about the price, note the fact that the Japanese DVDs are around $60 and only have 2 episodes. Kinda puts things in perspective, doesn't it? (Yes, that means that this series is 13 volumes in Japan...26 if you count the second season. 
This is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves. The storyline is great, but this should have been the last DVD. Things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over $20. That's bogus. DVDs can fit way more episodes on a single disc, and it's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately. The Cowboy Bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start, then dropped down to 4. Now it's just getting worse. At this point I'm starting to regret buying the Stand Alone Complex series instead of renting it. I am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out, though. Throughout the series I think disc 4 was my favorite 
With this DVD, Stand Alone Complex returns completely to the story arc at its core - the Laughing Man. With Togusa out of commission, the rest of section 9 focuses on finding the real culprits behind the attack on the Sunflower Society - The Ministry of Health. All three of the episodes here chip away at the truth but we will find little satisfaction in knowing the names. No sooner is a witness discovered, but he is killed, and the trail of corruption leads to the highest levels of government. This is the classic paranoid plot. More than one player makes the mistake of believing that there is some honor among thieves and faces elimination. The Ministry of Health is ruthless and heavily armed (as Major Kusanagi discovers), assassins lurk everywhere, and even Aramaki falls afoul of a plot. Gradually the entire ugly story of the intentional suppression of a treatment for cyberbrain sclerosis for a technology that is ineffective but makes a fortune for the politicians behind the scenes. This is a dark story. Without the actions of the Laughing Man no one would know that hundreds are due to die in agony to line the pockets of a political movement that will stop at nothing to increase its power, With no evidence Section 9 seems condemned to making desperate attempts to find a witness who will stay alive long enough to testify. And without that witness their hands are tied. Unlike the earlier Laughing Man episodes, the story has remained coherent from the moment that Togusa finds the paper report. Despite an intricate plot, the level of action stays high and there are a few real surprises for the viewer - it's not just the enemy who can be sneaky. With three more episodes to go, there's a lot of room for even more plot twists 
I've been wondering how a 26-episode series could be completed with 4-episode installments. Now, in retrospect, it all seems sadly obvious. Just put only 3 episodes on each of the last 2 discs... and CHARGE THE SAME PRICE! [sound of metallic breathing] DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE!!! On the positive side, I guess the reason is that all three episodes on this chapter are of the "Complex" variety and thus considerably advance the Laughing Man storyline. Don't get me wrong. This is a great chapter of Stand Alone Complex, highlighted by a scene in which the Laughing Man pulls someone's proverbial butt out of the proverbial fire. If there's a weak part of this installment, it's the sequence with the "Armored Suit", which for some unknown reason goes back and yet again rips off elements of the big fight at the end of the first GITS film, just as the "Testation" episode had done several installments back. The armored exoskeleton could have been used to greater effect. By the end of this installment, almost the entire shape and design of the Laughing Man plot seems clear. It is interesting to learn from the special features that the Murai vaccine plot was originally meant to be stand-alone material 
Hey, does anyone know how I can get the original version of this movie? That starts out with a long view of the sub barracks, gives a glimpse of Baldwin meeting Connery at an embassy party in DC, builds up the radiation badge issue, and so on. I must have seen this movie before they trimmed it down for broad issue. "Directors cut" does not appear to have this. Any ideas? As we all know, it's a great movie no matter what edition we view 
This is one of my all time favorites in the acton adventure category. It really is a must see about submarines. It is just really a stimulating movie. It is so much better than a bond movie and I love bond 
This is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama. 
One of the last great films of the Cold War era made around the time the Berlin Wall fell. The hunt for Red October is classic intrigue and tension of the USSR and USA over dominion of geopolitics. Sean Connery brings back the cool and intense demeanor that made him famous as the original James Bond 
"Central Intelligence Agency," Captain Bart Mancuso growls, descending a ladder in his sub, "Now there's a contradiction in terms." He is about to match wits with a wily Russian sub commander, played stoically and well by Sean Connery, who is trying to surrender his ship to the Americans, "a ship with only one purpose." The Red October is the pride of the Soviet fleet, its newest and biggest - and with the newest toy; a caterpillar drive, equipped to travel through the water nearly silently and almost impossible to detect. Connery's Captain Ramius - I was almost ready to believe that Lithuanians -Ramius is supposed to be Lithuanian - speak Russian with a Scots accent - has had enough Cold War in his life and wants to make sure he can level the playing field as he leaves, or die trying. Enter into the mix Jack Ryan, a young analyst for the CIA and a student of Russian sub commanders, Ramius in particular. I was always sorry Alec Baldwin did not reprise his role in the next Jack Ryan vehicle; I thought he brought a sense of urgency and brilliance to the role that Harrison Ford - don't get me wrong, I think he's good too - lacks- and I always thought Ford was too old for the part anyway. Baldwin had just the right touch, for the first movie. The camaraderie and mutual respect between his character and James Earl Jones' Admiral Greer is obvious; they know each other well, and trust each other's judgment. Recruited by Greer to convince a boardroom of military advisors on the sudden and mysterious naval activity in the North Sea, which is known to center around the new sub Red October,Ryan succeeds in selling the President's main advisor on what he thinks is going on - he's correctly surmised that Ramius wants to defect. Trusting that Ramius has already figured out the worst parts and has a plan worked out, the advisor Pelt delegates Ryan to go out and intercept the sub before the Russian fleet chasing him gets close enough to eliminate him. There are excellent supporting roles - Scott Glenn, as Capt. Mancuso, spent time aboard an actual working naval sub to get the authenticity of his part, and he is superb. Until I watched the extras on the DVD I was unaware that Larry Ferguson, who plays Chief Watson on Mancuso's sub, had a lot to do with writing the screenplay; I liked him before that, but knowing that added another dimension. It doesn't get any better than the aforementioned James Earl Jones; and also good, in smaller roles, are Courtney Vance, Sam Neill, and the lesser Russian officers that make up Ramius's elite cadre of expatriots. In contrast to what's been going on the last few years, the Cold War seems almost genteel in its menace. I could almost look back on it with nostalgia. Almost. This movie reminds us that things are never going to be easy or without cost, no matter what method of persuasion is employed. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. I know parts of it by heart 
Even though this movie has some "miles" on it...It never seems to be "dated"..the story is still full of suspense...and even though we have seen it several times..it never grows old. We live in a small fifth wheel..fulltime and this is one of the movies we both voted to take with us for those rainy days! A "must-have" for anyone who loves movies 
What a superb cold-war action flick. It has an all-star cast, all male, and many who became stars later. Sean Connery is Captain Ramius of the new super sub "Red October". His stature is legendary among all Soviet submarine captains, but his is Lithuanian and his wife has died a year earlier while he was at sea. He has no children. The officer crew of the sub was hand picked by him and are almost all men who are personally loyal to him. Jack Ryan here is played by Alec Baldwin in one of his best roles. He is a brilliant CIA analyst rather than a field officer and knows submarines. Because of what develops, he is brought in by CIA Chief Admiral Greer (the immortal and national treasure James Earl Jones) to advise the National Security Advisor Pelt (the wonderful and too soon lost Richard Jordan). There is a great deal of confusion between what the Americans, the Soviets, and the various crews of various ships know. We, the audience, know the actual situation, but we are concerned about who will learn what before or after it is too late. What I like most about this movie is that while there are some heroics, they aren't the superman kind of stunts that show up in too many action flicks. People try to do what they have to do and it doesn't always work out without a cost or even all that well. In the end, well, you already know or should watch the movie to find out. I do want to single out the terrific Courtney Vance as the sonar genius Jones, Scott Glenn as Commander Mancuso of the US sub Dallas and Sam Neill as the Soviet Captain Borodin - 2nd to Ramius. Fine performances from each. Even though the ships are big, shooting a movie in such confined quarters risks tedium and claustrophobia (which can work for a film if handled well). This film focuses in on faces and shows us people talking in small groups so we can see the emotion on their faces as they struggle to understand what is going on and what should happen next. Enjoy 
The DVD is a great movie. It was packed good and got to me in a short time 
this movie is a great movie for those how like movie on millitary and sub's. this movie keeps u thinking all the way through it and wondering what will happen next.Sean Connery as always was a great actor in this film and so was Alec Baldwin. I would just sugest it to just about anyone and definetly military lovers. 
Ah a classic. Just one of those movies that will never ever go out of style. Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin make a perfect team in this well done adaptation of the novel. Expertly cast and with very good cinematic effects, its just an all around great movie 
The thing I remember most about this film when I saw it in the theater in 1990 was its honesty. On every level. Great care was taken to accurately depict one particular community at one particular time--when AIDS was first being diagnosed as "the gay cancer," up through the mid-eighties, when attending monthly funerals was commonplace for gay men and their friends. Though HIV/AIDS had been around for a decade when this movie was made, there was no effort on the part of the filmmakers to whitewash the past. They not only show the ugliness of the disease, they show the ugliness of people's response to it. Even within the gay community there was a tendency for people to fingerpoint, accusing the first victims of being more promiscuous than themselves, or more excessive users of amyl nitrate and recreational drugs. There was fear of contamination, reluctance to touch or kiss, and even intimacy within monogomous relationships was hampered. People reached deperately for New Age cures, and Louise Haye was the reigning goddess of self-healing. By choosing to depict a five-year period, the filmmakers allow the viewer to see the lives of a group of friends evolve and deepen. Some of course succumb to the disease and die, others wrestle with their losses and rethink their lives. In the end, the survivors try to become part of the solution; they become visiting volunteers and political activists. For all its authenticity, the film is not depressing. This is incredible ensemble acting at its best. Campbell Scott, Bruce Davison, and Mark Lamos give especially moving performances, but there are no slackers in this cast. By the time the movie was released, the face of AIDS was already changing and the filmmakers were criticized for focusing exclusively on gay victims. I felt then, and I continue to believe, this is a misplaced criticism. All fiction is self-limited. LONGTIME COMPANION is the story of one small group of friends who are affected by an unknown and dreadful disease; and it shows how each of them responds to the challenges thrown at them. Yes, they were wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together on Fire Island. But LONGTIME COMPANION is not a celebration of their insular lives. In fact, by the end of the film, one of this insular group, Campbell Scott's character, is shown working as a home care volunteer who visits a Latino man. I think the filmmakers, like GMHC at the time, were aware that things were starting to change. It seems to me that the film's critics, even in 1990, had forgotten that AIDS was first announced in the New York Times as "gay cancer" and later as "Gay Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome" before being called AIDS. But that said, we need to remember that there are many other people's stories that are worth telling, including those of people living and coping with AIDS in Africa. My only hope is that these stories will be told with all the accuracy and sensitivity that went into the making of LONGTIME COMPANION. The DVD has no significant "extras," but the transfer is excellent 
There are a great many gay themed films available today, but when Longtime Companion was released, it was but one of a small handful of films brave enough to paint gay characters with empathetic and intelligent brushstrokes - something that continues to beset filmmakers even today. Set during the late 70's and on into the 80's the film is a bare bones and ruthlessly truthful before-and-after portrait of the devastating effects of the AIDS virus on a small group of close friends/lovers and on the wider gay community. Very funny, extremely moving, occasionally upsetting, whether you are a gay viewer or not, this film is a courageous celebration of the strength and frailty of the human spirit. 
This was a wonderful movie about a group of very good friends. The acting is realistic for the movies sake. It will definately pull at your heartstrings. Also full of the comapassion one hopes for in their end days/years. I was a caregiver so this was an important view. Highly recommended!!!! 
This drama is filled with possitive messages but has a darkness to it that will make you angry, in a productive way 
This moview will make you laugh and cry. It show that love and care that a group can give 
This film is a wonder for many reasons: beautiful performances, sharp writing and directing, and SAD. When I first saw this - the sobbing in the theater was so intense that I thought I'd have to build an ark to get home. Now, Longtime Companion is still all of those things but a little dated. Advances in medicine haved moved us to a point where AIDS is not an immediate death sentence. Watching this film years later it does play a bit like "And Then There Were None" - but it still works. Watch it and remember if you lived through that era, watch it and be greatful if you did not 
I saw the Broadway musical about 5 years ago and after seeing the movie and purchasing the DVD, I think that everyone should see this movie over and over again. Chris Columbus has done a wonderful job bringing this musical to film and keeping Jonathan Larson's ideals and thought-provoking view and dreams alive. The actors are first rate! They each have their own unique style and their voices are remarkable. I am happy to have the deleted scenes as a bonus in the DVD. I wish that Chris had kept "Goodbye Love" in the film, but thank god we have a chance to see it. It is a scene that has to be seen by all! The documentary on the Disc 2 is something I am privleged to have watched and I'm so happy to now know how Jonathan Larson lived his life. No day but today!! 
Not following the recent Broadway scene very much, I wasn't really aware of what a sensation "Rent" was several years ago when it debuted. I became more aware of it when it was satirized in the Southpark picture "Team America" and after my church intergenerational choir sang the show's "theme" song "Seasons of Love". Then one of the kids that I worked with in a local musical said Rent was one of his favorites, so I was a first-weekend attendee at the theatre. The story is important as it depicts gays, lesbians, drag queens and drug addicts as real people struggling with life, love (and AIDS) just like so-called "normal" people. Being in the rock style, the songs aren't necessarily "toe-tappers" that you end up whistling on the way out of the theatre (though "Seasons of Love" comes close, particularly if you've sang it at least two dozen times, and "La Vie Boheme" is a showstopper--the plot is supposedly based on the opera of that name), but overall the music is very exciting and integral to the story. The cast moved almost en masse from Broadway to Hollywood--Wilson Heredia, a Tony winner as drag queen Angel, should have contended for an Oscar as Supporting Actor. I've read that there was some concern about mainstream Hollywood director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter I and II) getting the job, but I don't see that the picture suffered for it--maybe some unconvincing special effects are the worst of it. As a rock opera, it takes some time to get used to having almost all the dialogue sung rather than spoken. Overall another solid four star film----definitely recommended to fans of modern musicals, to those in marginalized communities, and to those with art in their souls. P.S. Afterwards I got hooked on the soundtrack CD for a few weeks (months?) but that's another review 
I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less. I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs! 
I absolutely love this film. It is one of the best ever. I have been dying to see it on Broadway, but haven't been able to. It's so hard to anyways with Broadway being so expensive. But the film is amazing. The original cast of the broadway show - save for two - are in this film and it's great. I love that they brought alumni back that have actually been in the play and could really, and I mean, really know how these characters are. It's a great film. It brings a new light to those that haven't heard of the show before. And it brings about so many different issues that have been such a big part of our culture. AIDS, lesbians, gays, druggies. And it's just a great film. I related to Mark the most, because of how he loves to film things. I think that there is a "RENT" character for everyone! I give the movie a 10 out of 10!!! 
I have to say...I was a little weary when i decided to see this movie...alot of my friends raved about it, but im so picky, i didnt think id like it. so i watched it and i was blown away. i cried the first few times i saw it. I must've watched it about 10-20 times and i can never get enough. it is beautifully done. the music is excellent. the casting was clear perfection. i give props to the writer of the original play...what a masterpiece i could rave forever and ever about it. the storyline is such like todays life...paying rent sucks, and its nearly impossible to get good money around here. i could rant and rave for hours. all i have to say is, if you havnt seen it, it is a must for anyone over the age of around 15...the topics can get a little mature. but it really is worth it 
I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character. Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so "out there" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually. You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of "I'll Cover You", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie. Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse is no longer with us, because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material. 
Great music. Makes you want to get up and dance - or sing - or both. Filming in a New York winter helps to really bring you into their angst. I loved it 
Way too much money was put into the movie. The cast is way too old. It completely lost all of the grittiness and the pain of the play. It's very unfortunate that there was an opportunity to immortalize one of the great landmarks of the contemporary musical theatre and this is all we ended up with 
To me, The Office is one of those shows that people either love or hate. This past summer I became familiar with the show by catching the reruns of the 2nd season on NBC. After watching just one full episode, I was hooked. I continued to tune in each week to watch the reruns and ended up buying season 1 a few weeks later. I watched that DVD repeatedly and decided that I had to buy the 2nd season as soon as it was available on DVD. I've watched both seasons a countless number of times. The episodes never stop being funny no matter how many times you watch them. At least that's how it is in my case. I know most of the people who will read this review will have probably already seen the show and might be as big of a fan of it as I am, but I cannot express enough what an amazing show this is. The writing and the comedic timing are beyond words. I hope to see this show last for at least 5 seasons. Standout episodes from Season 2(in my opinion): The Dundies The Client Christmas Party The Injury The Secret Michael's Birthday Drug Testing Casino Night That was REALLY hard to choose because all of the episodes are amazing. 
This is one of the best purchases i've ever made, a great dvd to have in your collection, priceless episodes, a great cast... you can't go wrong in buying this dvd 
If you've liked even one of "The Office" TV episodes, you'll want to be enjoying this CD -- thus avoiding those disruptive commercials. Carried along by the excellent acting skills of the entire cast, you'll experience the pains and the passions of these familiar personality types. This is "reality TV" that's more real than reality itself 
I knew I loved The Office before I bought Season Two, but I didn't realize just how much. I've watched every episode so many times, and I'm not even close to being sick of them. The commentaries are so brilliant and involve so many of the actors and writers and producers and others from the creative team of this show. I've learned so much about the show in general, as well as the specific writing decisions they've made, and the actors' choices and thoughts on how certain scenes turned out. The extras like the bloopers and the PSAs are so wonderful as well. This is one of the best purchases I've made in a while 
This is hands down the best comedy on tv right now. The office uses intelligent humor, an excellent mix of characters to bring about some extremely funny situations and stories. Set in a small town and a mid-sized paper company, the manager is clueless when it comes to business but very charasmatic and lovable. His ignorance creates somve very memorable situations. i recommend this item for anyone who like humor that does not involve children hitting each other with trash cans 
Great DVD purchase. The extras are hysterical, especially the fake "more you know" public service announcements. 
This DVD set is great - a must have for any Office fan. The special features are really worth it. 
This DVD set of the second season was wonderful! It contains the complete shows plus deleted scenes from each episode. It also features commentaries on select shows, where the episode plays out and the actors and writers talk about what was going on in the moment, etc. This is in the bonus features, which also includes bloopers and fake P.S.A.'s and other gems. I highly recommend this if you are an Office fan, and if you aren't, get on board for cryin' out loud! It's an awesome show!! 
An absolutely amazing collection of Scrantonistic comedy! If you like the show, you'll love this collection of episodes, bonus clips, and deleted scenes. Enjoy 
This movie is complete garbage. I actually like Robert Downey Jr as an actor but hated him in this movie. Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this trash 
Robert downey plays a smooth talikng problem solver who tries to pick up a good-two-shoes teacher who is also a really good luck charm when it comes to playing casinos whose father is in enormous debt who is being bailed out by robert while still trying to pick up molly while being pursued by a scary hitman harvey keitel while being funny the whole time. It's a good movie, people. Buy it, own it, love it. Enjoy 
The Pick-up Artist is a dangerously bad film. There is absolutely no chemistry between Robert Downey and Molly Ringwald. Molly Ringwald may have been of the most iconic 1980's female actresses, and she certainly proves her worth here. Ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character wasn't supposed to be. That marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element. The real joke in this film has to be Robert Downey. His acting is insanely moronic. I often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick. I am pretty sure Robert Downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to. From the start to the end, I was annoyed. I couldn't see how Dennis Hopper and Danny Aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it. Harvey Keitel gives a fair performance, but I believe he is much tougher than that. Comparing Harvey Keitel's performance in Bad Lieutenant, Reservoir Dogs, and Mean Streets to The Pick-up Artist, it is enough to make an apparent observation that Harvey Keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this. A smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was Rising Sun, and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film. Why did they have to call it The Pick-up Artist? Could they give the movie a better title such as The Player 
This is a great film. Probably underrated by "professional" reviewers, it's full of energy, enthusiasm and fun. 
this movie is a romantic tale of a young man who wants to be the best salsa dancer *in the world pretty much. it's kind of cheesy and corny, but the dancing in the film is superb. the main character is a buff, good looking guy with a jerry curl *hehe* i guess that was cool during the time the movie was made! he is overprotective of his sister... blah blah, she goes out with his friend and he is against it but realizes that he is being stupid and goes on to become a great dancer. good watch for those of you into movies such as dirty dancing and llambada 
I first watched this movie when I was 7 years old, with my Mom, here in Croatia. Never have I imagined I would be able to buy it and watch it so many years after, especially since I have been dancing my whole life and salsa for the last 2 years. The words cannot express how I felt watching this movie and reliving the passion I feel every time I step on the dance floor. Yes, it's an 80's movie and yes, the acting could have been better. But that was how the music and salsa were interpreted back then I if it was any different, it would be disappointing. The lovestory is nicely incorporated in the movie, which is full of strong, bold salsa moves. Robby Rosa is absolutely fantastic and was the best choice for this role. The appearance of Celia Cruz, the Queen of Salsa, and Tito Puente shows that the makers of the movie wanted to show salsa in all its variety - from classical (Celia Cruz) to hip and modern (Chicos Y Chicas) because salsa can be danced to any music. It comes from the heart, and this movie shows it in the best possible way.  
So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing. Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!! I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!! I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing. This was TERRIBLE dancing! And there was hardly any salsa! It was 80s dancing to salsa music! That's IT. The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner. Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music. That's it. If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie. If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie... There was only one thing that I liked about this movie. The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz. That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for.... Oh, and the story line? What was it again???? Yeah... I love movies, good ones and bad ones. But this one??? The WORST movie I have seen so far... To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing. Hopefully, someday, there will be 
if amazon allowed zero stars, this would get it. absolutely awful. 
I love this movie!! I remember the first time I saw it, I was about 6-7 yrs.old, on a plane on my way to Puerto Rico. Eighteen (or so) years later, I bought it watched it with my family, it brought back so many great memories, We loved it all over again. I love the music, the dancing the actors/actresses, The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because IT IS AN 80's MOVIE! We all know how 80's dance movies have the bad fame of neing CORNY! I have to admit, it did have some corny and bad acting moments, but all in all, I think this is an amewome movie, I love it recommend it 
I lvoed this movie I have been looking for it for years. The story plot is ok but the dancing in the movie is awesome and the music is great. It just wants to make you get up and dance 
of course i enjoy this movie, i ordered it after so many years of searching for it... i love salsa music and the dancing.. 
Salsa is a brilliant movie - one of the best movies with no major plot. There is fantastic music and great dancing and a hot guy - what more could you want. Rico (Robby Rosa and Menudo) wants to win a dance competition that will take him to Puerto Rico. He's also the older and over protective brother to Rita and when she starts dating his best friend Ken, he goes nuts when he finds out (they keep their relationship secret for a while). Will this ruin his chance of winning the dance comp? As I said earlier, there is fantastic music in this movie. Margarita and Under My Skin are the best. The actual scene when they play Margarita is fantastic. It's a now dated movie, but it is still a favourite of mine that I do watch over and over again still. I love it and any fan of dance movies should love it to - especially if you like that latin flavour 
This movie really didn't show me anything exciting in Salsa dance...the only exciting thing was seeing singers performers Willie Colon and Celia Cruz. 
From start to finish a total waste of time. I viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman, we were all appalled at how desparate this "Pamela" was note to the director not all women waiting on God are that desparate. The so called Christian principals in this movie were laughable. At the end of the movie I found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time 
Ce-Ce Peniston was looking good was digging the vibe. the cat she married in the Film reminded me alot of Ronald "Mr.Biggs" Isley. I was waiting for Bro Man to start singing.this film flip flopped between the christian vibe sensual vibe.this film was a trip.Ce-Ce is still crazy stuffed likes it.but ain't alot of acting there,but oh well.this film was just ok with a couple of funny parts 
I just can not keep my hands off this awsome movie. I recomend it to anyone, any age, any time. It is the type of movie that you just have to get to understand the total greatness of! THE BEST ADVICE YOU'LL EVER GET!!! 
Julia Child still is the best! The DVD's contain many, many of the secrets to French cooking that only can otherwise be found by purchasing many books and watching hours and hours of the Food Channel. The examples and visual images are excellent. 
Just great, a real classic, and still so relevant today 
I purchased both DVD's of The French Chef. Both are equally enjoyable and bring back a different time when we didn't have "food celebraties" but just Julia. Still informative and interesting along with the combination of her irreverance and humor make these DVD's a must have whether the viewer enjoys cooking or not 
With many of the early episodes recipes included, this DVD is a delight. Watching Julia's aplomb as things go wrong is reassuring to anyone who has had a kitchen disaster. Though I doubt that I'll cook the tripe, some of the other recipes look worth tackling. 
I knew I would love learning from Julia's shows and see lots of techniques but I had no idea how hilarious these shows are. Julia has a dry humor and a delightful way of handling mishaps but the burned french onion soup and the tart that flipped out of the pan and onto the counter were the best!! No one on the food network would let you see how to do this part of cooking. I'm too young to have seen the shows first hand so there are all new to me. Julia said in an interview once that she always considered herself a cooking teacher and she is. The dish being prepared is just the vehicle to teach about everything from how to shop for food to how important it is to keep your area clean and tidy. And did you know that apples must be stirred with a "purple spoon?" Everything that I make from these DVDs is great and has become a kitchen regular. I recommend them for entertainment, education and a good laugh 
These DVDs are pure and uninterrupted Julia. No awkward introductions or montages--just JC. However, the episodes are jumbled and skip from the first episodes to later ones in the seventies---but no dates! so the only way to divine their sequence is by her clothing and hairstyle. Honestly--wouldn't it have been more effective to showcase her progression as a TV personality by revealing her episodes to us just as the public saw them 
Like others, I remember the fascination with watching Julia Child on public television as a kid in the 70's, and even beyond (I think it was on cable sometime within the last decade). Recently I felt compelled to purchase this. I own the book "In Julia Child's Kitchen" which most of the recipes for the color TV shows are found, and I had fond memories. I was not disappointed! In fact, I plan to purchase Volume 2. I love the way the discs are divided into appetizers, etc., main courses and desserts. So much information here. Each show is a full 30 minutes. I love how Julia throws other information in along the way (such as the French Onion Soup show where she goes into detail about sharpening and caring for knives). Such a warm and wonderful personality, she is always humourous, never condescending. It is funny to watch things "not quite" turn out as planned, and she goes with it. It is a joy to watch! My only disappointment is that there's not a "Volume 3." There are SO MANY of these shows available, I hope WGBH in Boston will release them in time. (One that I REALLY wish they would release on DVD is the Chicken Breast show which featured Chicken Kiev, I remember this one especially.) Yes, these shows are 30+ years old, and some of the foods are not quite what I would serve today (tripe, anyone?) but regardless there is a wealth of information in addition to the entertainment value. Highly recommended 
These `The French Chef' DVDs give us 18 episodes of this landmark Julia Child PBS series organized by course rather than by chronology. Among the first disc's side dishes are early (1960s) black and white episodes mixed in with later (1970s) color episodes. These confirm what we have read in Julia Child's biography that the early shows were Herculean feats of improvisation in front of a live TV camera in an improvised Boston (WGBH) studio, where there was no opportunity to edit out mistakes. These episodes show how Child really set the standard for the TV cooking show and invented almost all the conventions we see nowadays from the likes of Paula Deen, Giada DeLaurentiis, and Emeril Lagasse (in his no-audience `Essence of Emeril' shows). It also shows where show creators such as Alton Brown and Rachael Ray have created great shows primarily by breaking out of Julia Child's prototype. While the contemporary TV culinarians still follow Julia's lead, it is amazing to see how so many of Julia's shows still do a better job with their subject. For starters, you get the full 30 minutes of material per episode. You don't get 22 minutes of material with three interruptions for commercials and promotions. You also get complete shows on a single dish, albeit relatively complicated dishes like the classic `Salade Nicoise'. After four years of watching the Food Network virtually on a daily basis, I recall no show, even from the more classicly oriented hosts such as Martha Stewart or Ina Garten, dealing with a complete composed salad. The `Salade Nicoise' is composed of at least three major and two or three minor tasks. Making the potato salad alone takes practically half the show. And, actually seeing how Miss Julia composes the final presentation is easily worth anything from Ina or Martha. In contrast, the modern 22 minute culinary shows are often used to demonstrate three or even four different dishes, which leaves very little room for expounding on less common techniques. If nothing else, the art of the swapout has been mastered to the point where one may be surprised to see any real cookng at all. This is one reason why I respect Rachael Ray's demonstrations, as she is clearly always working in real time. One possible negative aspect of this show is seen on some episodes where Miss Julia gives us the traditional French method which has really been discarded by almost all modern chefs. One example which comes to mind is on her demonstration of trussing a roasting chicken. Every modern American writer I have seen, including even James Beard from 30 years ago, does not bother trussing a chicken in any way. They simply tuck the wing tips under the body and may suggest tenting the breast with aluminum foil or draping it with bacon so it does not become too well done while the slower cooking dark meat finishes. Even this show, however, has its virtues, as when Julia shows us how to detect when a bird has gone past its prime by checking the bone on the tip of the breast. If it is fully bony, the bird is probably well over a year old. If it is still soft, the bird is still between 9 and 12 months old. I was also pleased to see, on this episode, exactly how the wishbone is extracted and was reassured to see that even so expert a cook as Ms. Julia Child had some difficulty in doing it neatly. In short, Julia Child had no inhibitions against doing messy kitchen tasks. If you are a Food Network junkie, or just a foodie, you can't go wrong by acquiring these Disks. 
The French Chef....Julia Child....will forever be a national treasure. Thankfully, technology has made it possible for Ms. Child to teach for generations to come. 
Alright, I admit it: I am a chef wannabe. So my reviews of cooking and baking books, DVDs, etc are slanted. But you will have to admit, that before there was Paul, Jacque, Martha, Mario, Michael, Giada, Bobby and all the other greats, there was, and always will be, the one and only Julia. No one greater. This first DVD from her groundbreaking cooking series is a pure joy. When this series first came out in the 60's, I was a little kid. It was on Saturdays on our local PBS station. I would stop anything I was doing and plop myself in front of the TV and wait for this tall, somewhat accented, unusual lady to teach me another cooking/baking secret of French cooking. I was hooked from the moment that I saw her first show. She IS the queen. This show was the beginning of what would slowly evolve into an incredible food industry, eventually making TV cooking and baking a huge market, and starting the careers of many a chef. This is a 3-disc set. It comes encased within a jacket that shows many photographs of how the show was really made with set people put into uncomfortable positions in order to invisibly help Ms. Child in making her show the success that it was. The first disc is entitled "Starters and Side Dishes": 1. The Potato Show 2. Your Own French Onion Soup 3. Bouillabaisse a la Marseillaise 4. The Spinach Twins 5. Salade Nicoise 6. French Fries The second disc is entitled "Main Courses": 1. Beef Bourguignon 2. To Roast a Chicken 3. The Lobster Show 4. To Stuff a Sausage 5. Tripes a la Mode 6. The Whole Fish Story The third disc is entitled "Baking, Desserts, and Other Classics": 1. Queen of Sheba Cake 2. Cheese and Wine Party 3. Apple Dessert 4. Mousse Au Chocolat 5. The Good Loaf 6. The Omelette Show She makes cooking and baking a class in which she does not act as if she is perfect. Things happen and perhaps it won't go as smoothly as it should, but if it can happen to her, then you know it is OK to have mishaps occur for you. She made you comfortable in learning and appreciating a different cuisine. Her point was that she loved French cooking and she wanted to share that knowledge with you. Julia was quite an interesting woman who had a rather interesting and privileged upbringing. Suffice it to say that early in her life, she did not even know how to boil water, much less attempt French cooking. But the love of a man named Paul Child, changed everything and that love evolved her life into the woman we came to know and admire. If you are interested in her biography, I suggest "Appetite for Life: The Biography of Julia Child" by Noel Riley Fitch. She was such a gracious woman, but all who have known her have said that she was an everyday person, who took no pains in letting you know that she was as comfortable in simple surroundings as in fancy ones. You feel that in her manner of talking in this, or any of her series. She was the "grand dame" of the culinary world and we were blessed by her style and presence 
Dysfunctional, Open-Minded, and down right humorous describes "Confessions of an American Girl". Jena Malone (Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Stepmom) shines in this film, just like she always does. Two things that will always go together are Jena Malone an Indie/Black Comedy. But I'll have to admit some of the best acting in this film was that of Brad Renfro (The Client). He plays a 'closet' homosexual, and the obvious reason he hides it is because of his "tough as nails" prison father. A lot of the characters in this film are like a lot of people you know see in real life. And thought most label them as poor, white trash...You discover in "COAG" that they have passionate souls too. Also, on another note..Clifton Collins, Jr. was one of the best things in this film, and one of the funniest too. So, buy it, rent it..do what you must. It's great 
The story is interesting and the characterare querky. Malone is great. I really enjoyed this different movie. Something that Hollywood couldnt and wouldnt put out 
Highly Recommended as an Example of How to Stage and Sequence a Complex Scene. If you like black comedy, you should enjoy "Confessions of an American Girl". Rena (Jena Malone) is the embodiment of that old cartoon where the guy is sitting on the ground with a noose around his neck and a broken rope in his hand; captioned "some people can't do anything right". Rena lives in a mobile home with her somewhat "strange" family, is suicide challenged, is pregnant by a guy who doesn't want to be seen in public with her, and blames it all on the unfair eight year absence of her loving father, who is in prison for murder. Her dim idealic memories of her father are somewhat biased. The highway and its exit ramps are metaphors for her life and her desire to end her life. The film is not quite as good as "Ghost World" but has much the same tone and feel. Alicia Witt plays Rena's half-sister. Because Malone and Witt are arguably the most intelligent actresses in Hollywood, you immediately wonder about the wisdom of casting them as moronic trailer trash. But Malone has a special talent for playing this kind of "slack-jawed" character and Witt's standard sarcastic teen character works fine even in this environment. Their scenes together are the best ones in the film; with their reconciliation scene toward the end especially good. Brad Renfro does a good job as Rena brother, O-Lon Jones (remember the waitress in Seinfeld's "Bubble Boy" episode) is excellent in a small role and Clifton Collins Jr. is great as Buddy, the prison trustee, who quickly sizes up the situation and sets the forces of change in motion. While "American Girl" is an above average film, its main scene (the picnic at the prison which actually takes up the majority of the film) pushes it into cinema classic territory. This scene is an example of the way storytelling should be done, and the pacing is absolutely inspired. It is staged perfectly as Buddy orchestrates a sequence of revelations that changes all four visiting family members. Even if you hate the subject of this film it is worth watching just to see how wonderfully they manage this climatic scene. The disasterous visit over, the family leaves the prison with the statement "it went better than it could have". Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child. 
At first this movie seemed trite, but less than halfway into it, it became something much more. An honest look at a dysfunctional and insecure girl, her older and just downright mean half sister, her brother John, who is the calmest and simplest character ( with a dark secret ) in the movie. Her hardworking single mother ( played superbly by Michelle Forbes ) and her over the top father sent away to prison for two consecutive life terms for murder. Jena Malone's character dreams of seeing her father, knowing him and making him proud right at the time that she realizes she is pregnant. In one day at the annual prison picnic ( do these things actually exist? How scary!! ) the family reunites reluctantly except Rena ( Malone ). What follows therafter are numerous amounts of surprises and several laugh out loud moments. While some of this movie may be funny, this is certainly a more serious film that deals with coming of age, the longing that comes with having an absent father in a young persons life, suicide, depression, and coming to terms with one's reality and not just the dream they want. I was amazed at how good this movie actually was. The acting by all cast members is really great and the story is not boring, however shocking or disturbing it may be, it is simply real. Possibly someone else's reality which makes it all the more interesting 
This movie showcases Jena Malone's talent immensly. It has it's sad and poignant moments, but overall it has a lot of heart, and believe it or not, you may relate to some of the emotions expressed in this film. Recommended for Jena Malone fans and dark comedy lovers everywhere 
I'm no big fan of gay or lesbian films. I only bought this DVD bcuz I'm a huge Lili Taylor admirer. So i wasn't expecting very much from it. But while watching this movie I couldn't believe my eyes how great and touching this story was. I especially liked the scene with Lili and Courtney sitting in park, and yearning to touch each other but they couldn't do it and instead they touched themselves in their minds. Another great drama point was Courtneys and Lilis alienation because of Lilis high devotion to her studies. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves great Drama. you won't be disappointed. 
Not your usual depressing cheesy production value type lezbo vehicle that we're used to seeing, thank god for that. Pluses: Courtney is great, the characterization well thought out. The story is absorbing, well acted, but in the end its just another disappointment, ends left dangling and unresolved, not quite up to the hollywood standard. Minus: A downer overall...a little bit homophobic at times, as the womyn in it suffer from their own inner repressions/dialogues, etc. Still, it's better than most 
As a guy, when I see the word "lesbian" on a DVD cover...I spring for it. Usually, (in my experience) it's a pretty stupid movie. "Julie Johnson" is done in a more mature and sophisticated way than the other ones I've seen, but there's still a lot missing here. Julie Johnson is played by Lili Taylor, who has lost her looks quite a bit since I saw her in John Waters' "Pecker." Julie is a typical housewife. She's a stay-at-home-mom (one of her children is Mischa Barton, formerly of "The O.C."), with no High School diploma and a mean husband (Noah Emmerich) who frequently downsizes her. When she decides she's going to get her GED and, possibly, go to college her husband finally pushes her too far and she kicks him out of the house. Her friend, Claire (Courtney Love, in a marvelously subdued performance), is inspired by Julie's decision and leaves her husband. Julie allows Claire to stay with her and the kids and eventually admits to Claire that she has sexual feelings for her. Claire is mad, at first, but eventually admits to the same feelings. Pretty soon, the neighborhood catches on and the couple become outcasts; The film eventually ends abruptly, almost as if one of the lead actors died before they could finish filming. The movie is pretty cliched, you can see what decision the character is going to make about five minutes before they actually do. Taylor plays the role very realistically and Love delivers one of her best performances. This didn't affect my enjoyment (or lack) of the film, but I'm merely saying this as a warning to other viewers. THIS FILM CONTAINS ABSOLUTELY NO NUDITY. The movie has a kind of organic feel to it and the cinematography is less-than-spectacular. It's better than a film like "Better Than Chocolate" but if you never see this film in your lifetime...It's not going to affect anything. GRADE: B 
JULIE JOHNSON is a quiet little film that deals with the frustrations facing a New Jersey housewife and mother who married and birthed before she graduated high school and finds herself in a rigid relationship, longing for knowledge to change things. She considers herself stupid, sneaks Science magazines to read when her overbearing husband isn't around, and finally gathers the courage (while staring at the stars one night) to change her plight. She takes a computer course, passes her GED and with the constant support of her dearest girlfriend gathers the courage to get out of the stifling marriage with her husband and study to improve her lot in life. Along the way she discovers other secrets about herself, buried in the facade of a life she has led. She changes, relates to the world in a different way, and refuses to settle for returning to 'the old life' when her husband returns promising her change. Her relationship with her girlfriend proceeds to intimate levels, but in the end this friendship cannot last, as her girlfriend doesn't have the same goals. The story is simple, but in the hands of the writers Wendy Hammond and Bob Gosse and with Gosse's fine direction, the entire cast gives us an ensemble of disparate characters in whom we can all believe. Lili Taylor plays the lead with extraordinary skill and as her girlfriend Courtney Love gives a bravura performance. The remainder of the cast (Spalding Gray, Noah Emmerich, Gideon Jacobs, Mischa Barton, et al) is likewise strong. But it is Taylor's film and she offers one of her most poignant performances of her career. A thoughtful, sensitive, engrossing film. Grady Harp, September 0 
this has got to be one of the WORST, most unrealistic movies to date. i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks--rarely are they done well. this one, however, takes it to a whole new level. what was courtney love thinking?! you'll regret wasting your money on this. i can't even fathom why it's gotten decent reviews so far 
This movie didn't do anything for me...Didn't care for the characters or the plot. The ending was disapointing also. 
If you are in the market for a romantic lesbian love story -this is not the movie to look to. The movie is 1 hour and 34 minutes long and I couldn't wait for it to be over! I love Lilly Taylor -she was amazing in Mystic Pizza, Who Shot Andy Warhol, Dog Fight, and most recently made a special run during the last days of Six Feet Under. As a Lilly Taylor fan you will be sorely disappointed that she chose this role. This story is about a woman who wants more out of life, but the script is so far fetched in how this transition unfolds. She goes from minimal, menial high school drop out to physicist student extraordinaire in what seems like the span of a semester or two. Granted, the time table could have been better in this film, but that's only a very small part of it. Every single character in this movie is obnoxious and hard to like with the exception of Taylor. Her husband starts off a sexist, chauvinist and ends the film in much the same way you would just like buy him a clue. Her children are bratty and always shouting they can't leave the room or scene quick enough. Her love interest is Courtney Love, and while I love her too -even of late with all of her bad press she's not likeable either. Courtney Love is probably the worst of them all. Her character is afraid of change, afraid of being true to herself, worries too much about what other people think of her, wants to be accepted at the cost of herself, and as a result runs back to what is familiar to her and in the end it's okay with her. The only redeeming quality in the movie Julie Johnson is that Julie Johnson did not want to go back to the kind of woman she was before her awakening. She never lost her girlish vulnerability throughout the movie, and although cautiously and at times timidly eventually embraced the changes of her new life with admirable, quiet strength. 
**** I really enjoyed this movie for a variety of reasons. It was entertaining and fun, and the subject matter was also interesting to me, since I love both personal growth and intellectual learning. The plot of "Julie Johnson" centers around two women who leave difficult marriages, move in together, develop romantic feelings for each other, and around the effects of their decisions upon each other, their friends, and their children. Julie returns to school and discovers many things about herself that she missed out on since she had not ever graduated from high school and had always thought of herself as stupid, an opinion reinforced regularly by her brutish husband. I was unsure if I would enjoy this movie, as I do not necessarily enjoy lesbian love stories, finding them generally caught up in the message of the acceptance of homosexuality more than a great plot, acting, directing, etc. This movie is not like that; it is more about the awakening of a woman's potential at mid-age. It is about how when we grow personally, we can leave people behind, even people we dearly love. It is about the lines drawn between friendship and romantic love---how do we draw them and when? It is about how we decide to call the end to a romantic relationship. When we are adults and change dramatically, discovering something new about ourselves that revolutionizes our lives, how does this affect those around us? In this movie, for the main character Julie, it was not lesbianism that she discovered that mainly transformed her life, but a love for learning. When you are an adult and a life-long learner how do you cope in our society, which oftentimes tells you that this is "weird" behavior? (This last question is my favorite of all, and I related to this movie a lot, as often people who love to learn, study, and discuss ideas (like me) find themselves the targets of prejudice as being dull, boring, and "no fun".) All of these questions are explored in this story of two blue-collar lower middle-class homemakers and the challenges they face. The lesbian lovemaking scenes are not explicit, they are in good taste, and they made sense within the context of the movie. The actors in this movie are fabulous---Lili Taylor, Courtney Love, and the actors playing the children as well. I did not think the movie was clichï¿½d at all. The husbands were stereotyped and seemed in many ways like Neanderthals...but there were also men portrayed in positive ways, such as Julie's major professor. This is not an anti-male film. Lovely, quality, unforgettable film. *** 
Wow - what an excellent film! Great acting, directing and story. Sort of "Rainman meets Hoboken housewife meets lesbian love affair". I must admit, I was very leery of watching this, fearing it was going to be a Lesbian Love Story. I must admit, I am not a fan of the L-Word, bit I loved Queer As Folk. I watched this because I had a copy of the movie, having done a DVD Release Party at the club I work at. Otherwise, it would have been very unlikely that I would have ever watched it. That said, I am very glad I did. The 90 minute film packs a lot of punch, and the first 30 minutes zoom by, setting the storyline for the rest of the film, so watch carefully. Lili Taylor and Courtney Love, the leading ladies are both excellent in their roles as relatively unhappy Hoboken NJ housewives. Julie (played by Taylor) embarks on a mission to get her GED, against her husbands wishes. She eventually kicks him out. Claire (played by Love), her best friend from High School, leaves her husband. With no place to go, Claire moves in with Julie and her 2 children. In the meantime, Julie begins her quest for knowledge, passing her GED and eventually turning her goals towards a college degree. Notice, we still don't have much of a love story, do we? Midway through the film, that all changes - in a compassionate, yet confusing manner. Without giving away the entire story line (which includes a few very funny scenes amongst most of the drama), two women must come to terms with their feelings, for each other, and for themselves. This is really a gem of a film, and (as I have said before), it is a shame this will not be seen by many --- some whom desperately need to see a story like this. If Brokeback Mountain and Transamerica can make the big screen, well then so should Julie Johnson. This is not a lesbian love story, this IS a story about relationships, and the journey most of us take to achieve happiness and love in our own lives. Buy, rent or see Julie Johnson 
How do you twist and turn the most obnoxious individual with a completely disgusting job into a hero? That is black magic. After some time you begin to wish him well and feel tempted to light up. This lovely satire on political correctness, lobbyism, and corruption draws you into the unbearable lightness of smooth talking. If you argue correctly, you can not be wrong, right? Eckhart is perfect in the main part; there are many nice smaller parts, but my favorite is the little boy playing the hero's son. The boy deserves a nomination for best supporting actor. Actually he looks like Scarlet's little brother sometimes. Are they related 
I tend to be hard on a lot of major motion pictures because, to be frank, they mostly suck. However, this only turned into a "major motion picture" after Fox Searchlight bought it after it's screening at the Sundance Film Festival. Before that it was the vision of fledgling director Jason Reitman to independently bring Christopher Buckley's tremendously smart and funny book of the same name to the screen... and he does a good job. There's a reason why this film is loaded with the (mostly unpaid or underpaid) who's who of Hollywood talent. The script and screenplay are that good. This is not the typical low-brow, fart-joke riden crap you're used to seeing out of Hollywood. There are good acting performances throughout as well. If you are a person of above average wit and have a dry sense of humor, you'll like it. 
It starts out well but half-way through, it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis. Avoidable 
Jason Reitman makes an impressive debut as director with this entertaining comedy `Thank You For Smoking,' which is more satirical than any of the comedies his father Ivan Reitman made. Despite the film's plot about one Nick Naylor, ace spokesperson for the tobacco industry, `Thank You For Smoking' refuses to take sides while keeping us hugely entertained with its dialogues. Aaron Eckhart delivers a superb performance as Nick Naylor, a chief spokesman and lobbyist for tobacco industry, who in his `spin' mode can easily manipulate the opinions of the suspicious audiences on TV show. Nick is also a good father to his son Joey (Cameron Bright), before whom Nick tries to be a role model. Today Nick thinks of a brilliant idea of production placement - how about showing Hollywood stars smoking in a spaceship? - he flies to California with his son, meets a suave movie producer wearing kimono (Rob Lowe), and in his free time delivers a package to an ailing old man (Sam Elliott) who is about to sue the tobacco company. The satire is funny, but its target changes frequently. It could be tobacco industry (why not), but also could be those politicians (represented by William H. Macy's senator) who seems very hostile to Nick, and Nick himself. Sometimes the story goes too far, which includes a brief episode of abduction, but it is most effective when it shows Nick's darkly funny conversations with his friends, lobbyists for alcohol and guns (Mari Bello and David Koechner, calling themselves MOD Squad) over their lunch. Other cast includes Robert Duvall, Adam Brody, Kim Dickens, J. K. Simmons, and Katie Holmes. The acting is unanimously good, but the film belongs to Eckhart's Nick Naylor, or his art of spin. The film may lack the thought-provoking ideas about the on-going social issues. Still what you see in `Thank You For Smoking' is always amusing, clever, and even absurdly funny, and is never boring 
Thank You For Not Smoking is one damn sharp movie! This movie ends before it starts, its one of those where you want to rewind it in the middle of watching just to make sure that you didn't miss any thing. Yes, it's just that blunt. If Aaron Eckard who plays big tobacco lobbyist does not condition you to think differently about smoking or some thing other conversational topic then maybe you need to watch this movie again. The body of the message of this film portrays is not that you should pick up smoking, that is it right and that you should go out and buy your child a pack on their 18th birthday. But rather this movie's real message is about challenging the viewer to think for himself or herself. Amen! A film that makes people to think for themselves in the world of movies where you walkout dumber than you go in and then you wonder, why did I just pay for that? Naylor's job is to get himself caught in the middle of the controversy of smoking in America. His message is that people should think for themselves and that big tobacco needs customers, so it to their benefit of people who have cancer to continue to smoke and if they die it would be a loss for the smoking industry. Naylor's personal and professional life are one in the same, as he is convinced himself that when you on the right side of the argument you can never be wrong. And even if you have to change your argument half way through it you can always be right, even when right is all negotiable. For all the films produced today that believe their causes are to inform and pump information into your head, fact or fiction, Thank You For Not Smoking ask you the question of whether or not thinking that way is correct, and if so, why? It moves very fast and will not be film that you decide to turn off half way through, includes many bonus features and gives you a real life view of how this movie was produced and what was the inspiration of making such a movie. 
There's not a lot you need to know about THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, except that it's a gleefully jaundiced, well-nigh perfectly paced adaptation of Christopher Buckley's novel. As a teacher who used to lead a class on Critical Thinking, I took particular pleasure in the witty "spins" glib lobbyist Nick Naylor treats us to as he advocates for Big Tobacco. SIDELIGHT: Not one person in this film actually smokes a cigarette. And special shout-outs to excellent supporting actors David Koechner (as gun advocate Bobby Jay Bliss) and J.K. Simmons (as Budd "B.R." Rohrabacher). Oh, and Rob Lowe is actually darned funny in his role. I guess he can act after all 
The most surprising and refreshing thing about writer/director Jason Reitman's THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is that no one smokes--not tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, not the alcohol and guns lobbyists, not the investigative reporter, and certainly not the Vermont cheese senator. This is a nutty and witty comedy satire that reminded me fondly of the 1940's Preston Sturges comedies, with their zany dialogue and flawless supporting casts. SMOKING's key character, Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart in the performance of his career to date), is a tobacco lobbyist who is sympathetic. Divorced, with a 12 year old son he tries to be a great role model for, Naylor believes that Americans have the right to smoke and the right to choose whether or not they will. He knows he manufactures a product that causes death, but he can be wickedly hilarious about it. Like with Cancer Boy on THE JOAN LUNDEN SHOW: "Why would I want this young boy to die? We would lose one more potential adult smoker." Then he invades an elementary school classroom, where one little girl tells him, "My Mommy says that cigarettes can kill you." "Oh? Is your Mommy a doctor? A scientific researcher? Then maybe she doesn't have all the facts." This is a hysterically funny and inspired satire. Curiously, the villain of the piece may be William H. Macy as the unpleasant Vermont Senator who sells "cheese that creates fatty arteries and heart attacks," replies Nick. Nick also has a reporter (DAWSON CREEK's Katie Holmes) want to do a story on him; the two end up as literally strange bedfellows. Meanwhile, the head of the Tobacco Lobby, Robert Duvall, dies of lung cancer. And the alcohol and gun control lobbyists keep fighting for Americans' rights to drink and fire guns, hopefully not at the same time. The source here is a novel by Christopher Buckley and it must be a lulu. It would be fun to know whether or not Mr. Buckley smokes. I am a lifelong non-smoker with asthma. Nick Naylor would probably say to me that it is my right and choice not to smoke, knowing the dangers of cigarettes. The movie makes such a complex case for both sides, which is a tribute to director Reitman's brilliant screenplay. One wishes both it and Eckhart's fabulous performance could be Oscar nominees next Spring for this 2006 comedy delight. But the whole cast is a dream--Macy, Holmes, Duvall, Maria Bello, Adam Brody; and the dialogue is brilliant. If you want a good time at the movies, don't even consider missing the wonderfully funny THANK YOU FOR SMOKING on DVD. The movie is in Panavision and letterboxed on DVD. Bonuses include a superb CHARLIE ROSE SHOW with Buckley, Reitman, Eckhart, and producer David O. Sacks; an audio commentary I do not recommend until a second viewing of the movie; two filmmaking featurettes; and deleted scenes with filmmaker commentary. 
I had heard good reviews about this film and quite often this leads to let down upon viewing but I am happy to say that this was not one of those times. The writing is slick and humorous and the acting is great all round. This film is clever and different and overall a good break from a lot of the junk we've been subjected to lately. Whilst not one of those films you would "rave" about, it is very entertaining and definately worth a look 
Of all the films I watched this year, this one impressed me the most. It is well directed, edited, acted, and shot. It deals with an extremely controversial issue by attacking it head on, and making both sides laugh at themselves. Thank You for Smoking is both hilarious, and terrifying at the same. You can't help but fall in love with one of the most despicable, morally vacant characters ever to grace the big screen. When he gets what's coming to him, you fell sorry for the guy, and root for him to come out on top. If you want to laugh your butt off, while learning a little something about how to succeed in American politics and big business, watch this film! 
Back in my younger days, I probably would've filled an entire wall of my house with VHS tapes of my favourite childhood TV shows - Knight Rider, Airwolf and, of course, the A-Team. Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, I can now store the first four seasons in a small corner of my shelf. Looking at the series through adult eyes, it's absolutely amazing to see just how well this show has stood the test of time. When I was young, I enjoyed the totally implausible but well-mounted action scenes. As an older and wiser man, I enjoy it for the charisma of its four main stars. They all have a sense of fun, camraderie and joie de vivre about life in general that you just don't find in shows nowadays. It's amazing to see just how popular these shows still are. Like everyone else, I sometimes wish they'd bring shows like this back. Characters like Michael Knight, Stringfellow Hawke, and Hannibal Smith and co. provided some truly great role models that most of todays modern TV shows sorely lack. I wouldn't have grown up to be the man I am today without them 
This was the season when the A-Team was the highest rated television. This comedic series had an eclectic group of actors with George Peppard, Mr. T, Dwight Shultz, and Dirk Benedict who with their everyman type of fighting and propensity to create tanks out of gardening supplies provided a fun hour of television. This season had a few turkey episodes but overall it was entertaining with several excellent episodes, some of which were penned by the excellent writing talents of Stephen J. Cannell. The Big Squeeze, and Incident at Crystal Late stood out as some of the best the episode in the series and even the ones that were a little clich such as Bullets and Bikinis, and Timber you got the idea the actors where having a little fun. This season was before the Cosby show made them make some serious changes in order to try to stay alive, and the formula was in full force. So if you like to watch elaborate con jobs or even the worst (or best shots) in the cinema pick up this season 
I'm probably one of the biggest fan of the A-Team ever since I was a little kid and would watch the show each day when reruns were on TV. When I started noticing that DVD's were going to be released from various shows, my first thought was that "Oh I can finally get this on DVD!". Well I have picked up the first three seasons so far and although I'm thrilled to have each of the episodes, I'm dissappointed on another level for a number of reasons. Most of the sets out there are filled with bonus features and rare footage..however we get none of that with any of the box sets that have come out so far and I doubt we will. It's not like this show was on for a few months and got cancelled...it ran nearly 100 episodes on NBC! Wouldn't you think there would be something that would enthuse us fans?!? I have some other gripes about it...but I guess I shouldn't be complaining that much. At least it's out on DVD compared to some other shows that have failed to make it to release yet. 
I bought this the day it came out and watched a couple of episodes without incident and then began watching "The Bend In The River" when the problems started. At 1 hour 10 minutes and 43 seconds into the episode right when Hannibal says "sure" the dvd just stopped and went to the main menu. The rest of the episode was missing...it just stopped so I tried it out on two other dvd players I have here and then figured I got a bad copy and went up to the store to exchange it. Well, once I got it home the second one did the same exact thing, so I exchanged it a third time. The third copy actually plays through the episode but freezes for about 5 seconds in the exact same place that the others were messed up. I haven't even gotten to the other 5 DVD's but my assumption from reading the reviews here is that they are going to have problems too. I can't understand how they release these seasons of the A-Team so painfully slow at Universal and can let something with this many errors reach the stores. In the 10 months since the release of Season 2 could they not have had some type of quality control make sure that the Season 3 DVD's actually played? This release has absolutely no bonus features unlike the Columbia House collectors edition ones, which have some outtakes and other things. And I have to wonder with this release just like the other two seasons why can they not put chapters in where the commercial breaks are instead of having to fast forward to get back to the spot I left off? Just like Season 2 these are double sided DVD's which scratch very easily and make all kinds of noises in the DVD player, I would have liked 6 single sided DVD's much better. And one last problem is that when you put the DVD you absolutely have to watch the Universal Studios introduction for about 10 seconds because you cannot skip it and access the menu. There are two good things I can say about this release the first being that it's the A-Team, which is the best television show of all time and this is probably my favorite season. The second good thing is that a coupon is enclosed for $5 off of Season 4 when it gets released. To have released this Season with this many errors and problems on the DVD's is an insult to A-Team fans everywhere who have waited 20+ years to buy this on DVD. Universal needs to recall all of them and issue working copies. Update: I have just gotten off the phone with Universal and they have said that they will replace the DVD for me and others who are having problems. You can call them at 972-293-5903 or email ushe.consumerrelations@worldmarkinc.com and put A-Team Season 3 replacement in the subject line. I have added a star to my review since they're customer service was friendly and returned my call promptly, but I have still subtracted a star for each trip I have made to the store. 
Back when I was in elementary school, I used to watch The A Team every Tuesday night at 7:00 PM. I already have seasons 1 and 2, and can't wait to but this one. I'll also be buying season 4. But season 5. Jeez, I hated season 5. That's one of the major reasons the show went of the air. In season 5, the style of the series changed drastically, became less fun and quirky. I recall the episodes becoming more serious and drama like. It just didn't compare to the first four seasons. Nonetheless, I'm glad I'll be able to add the rest of the episode to my all time favorite TV series 
A-Team-The Complete Third Season is now available on DVD. The dual sided DVD box set includes all 25 episodes from the shows 1984-1985 season. The A-Team was a very popular series during the 80's. Co-star Mr. T owes much of his 1980's success to The A-Team. Mr. T, as B.A., didn't really have as much screen time as Hannibal (George Peppard) or the characters of Face and Murdock, but he is easily the most recognizable member of the cast. Season 3, similar to previous seasons was filled with-action, adventure, exotic locals, disguises, and interesting situations. The season begins with the episode "Bullets and Bikinis" (airdate 9/18/84). When the mob attempts to take over a hotel The A-Team to rescue her hotel. In a strange twist, the two part episode "The Bend In The River" falls into the slot of the second and third episodes of the season. Usually when a series has a two part episode early in the season that episode is used as the season premiere. Well, "The Bend in the River" is actually a slow episode which may explain why it was not used as the season premiere. In this episode an archeologist is traveling in the Amazon region looking for secrets but he finds conflict with local pirates and bad guy named El Cahon. Soon Hannibal is seen on a movie set dressed up in a monster costume as The Aquamaniac. After he is fired , Face tries to convince the producer to keep him on. With no film work keeping them occupied, they decide to help Tanya (the archeologists girlfriend) find her missing archeologist boyfriend. By season three, The A-Team had begun to lose a little of it's magic and fan base. Compared to Miami Vice, The A-Team seemed a little quirky and corny at times. Despite this, it was still a great show and fans of the show should add season three to their collection because there were some good episodes during the season. Season three special guests include Markie Post (Nightcourt), Dennis Franz (NYPD Blue), and Kristen Meadows. 
Directed by Steve Pink, whose previous credits includes writing the screenplay and co-producing the films Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) and High Fidelity (2000), Accepted (2006) stars Justin Long (Galaxy Quest, Jeepers Creepers, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story) as Bartleby `B' Gaines, a recently graduated high school student who, after being rejected from every college he applied to, decides to create a fictional school rather than face the humiliation of his peers and disappointment of his parents. Also appearing is Jonah Hill (Grandma's Boy, Click), Adam Herschman, Blake Lively (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants), Columbus Short (Save the Last Dance 2), Maria Thayer ("Strangers with Candy"), Anthony Heald (The Silence of the Lambs), Travis Van Winkle (Transformers), and comedian/social commentator Lewis Black (Jacob's Ladder). As the film begins we meet a klutzy Ferris Bueller type named Bartleby `B' Gaines, who, upon learning he's gotten his application rejected from like his seventh or eighth college, decides, with the help of his friend Sherman (Hill), to make up a fictional school called South Harmon Institute of Technology, which is supposedly a sister school to a local (and real) institute of higher education. Why? Well, mainly to appease his parents, particularly his father, who's kind of an a-hole. Pretty soon the lie begins to snowball and Bartleby is forced to come up with an actual facility, to which he takes the money his parents gave him for tuition and leases a decrepit building that once was used as a psychiatric hospital. With the help of his friends they fix it up enough to pass it off as a school, along with bringing in Sherman's slightly crazy Uncle Ben (Lewis) to act as the dean. Bartleby manages to scam his parents well enough, but guess what? Sherman, who created the web page for the fictional school, made the site a little too realistic, and pretty soon a slew of dregs, dweebs, mutants, malcontents, and spaz types, none of whom could get into other schools, begin showing up, tuition in hand, believing they've gotten accepted to South Harmon. Rather than crush their dreams, Bartleby decides make the school semi-legit by letting the students make up their own classes based on what they want to learn. Things seem to go well for a while, that is until Dean Van Horne (Heald), who presides over the real Harmon, decides he wants the land adjacent to his university for expansion purposes (South Harmon just happens to be on that land). Eventually Bartleby's sham is exposed, but his school has become something more than intended (an actual learning institution) and Bartleby and his friends opt for a long shot in trying to get the school accredited and avoid going to jail under fraud charges. All in all I thought this film, albeit formulaic, was funny and fairly entertaining. The plot is pretty unrealistic but then it is a screwy comedy so it helps if you suspend a good deal of disbelief. As I said the plot's formulaic as you have the standard setup of the main character creating a wacky situation, one that eventually gets out of hand, ultimately crashing down around his ears, resulting in a last ditch effort to save the day. There's also a love interest element as Bartleby's has it bad for a character played by Blake Lively, who, in turn, is dating slimy, snobby president of the fraternity, both of whom go to the real Harmon. Eventually she comes to see her boyfriend for what he is and takes up with Bartleby thinking he's all cool and the real deal, which results in disappointment as she discovers most everything he's presented himself as, in terms of the school, is fake. Will Bartleby be able to save the day and get the girl? Probably...I thought all the performers did pretty well, including Long himself who seems a charming and personable fellow, but the character I enjoyed most was that of Sherman, played by Jonah Hill. He was sort of the token, chubby, awkward nerdlinger, but he was also really funny, especially when he was trying to fit in with the fraternity types. You see, Sherman got accepted to the real Harmon, and was pledging the main fraternity as a legacy, but the so called `cool' types seemed only interested in humiliating him as much as possible. There's plenty of crazy characters running around that manage to keep things interesting, probably the wackiest a character named Glen (Herschman), a misfit who got fired from the local kwik-e-mart for making a shrimp slushy (he was both hungry and thirsty). Lewis Black pulls his shtick out for the film, as he can be seen ranting on in his usual fashion and provides a few comical moments as an unorthodox dean. As this was Pink's directorial debut I thought he did extremely well as he really kept things lively and moving along at a good pace. Another aspect that helped a lot was an rousing soundtrack which included some good tunes from bands like The Pixies, Green Day, Citizen Cope, Modest Mouse, Weezer, The Hives, and The Cure, to name a few. The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) on this DVD looks sharp, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, available in English, French, and Spanish, comes across well. Extras include an audio commentary track with director Pink and performers Justin Long, Lewis Black, Jonah Hill, and Adam Herschman. Also included is a comical bit entitled Adam's Accepted Chronicles, a making of featurette titled `Reject Rejection: The Making of Accepted', a self-guided campus tour, a couple of music videos, some deleted scenes, and music MP3 files from the film, accessible through your computer. Cookieman108 By the way, take the first letter from each word in the name of the school...South Harmon Institute of Technology...what does that spell? This joke is played on a lot throughout the movie... 
Accepted is an enjoyable comedy, although a little hard to believe. Bartelby B. Gaines is a high school senior who has one major problem. He hasn't been accepted into any of the college and university's that he applied to, not even the state university that was his fall back choice. Tired of not having an answer for the "Where are you going?" question and dismayed at disappointing his parents Bartely B. comes up with an idea. In the beginning it's just an acceptance letter. He creates a letter stating that he was accepted to South Harmon Institute of Technology. He even has his friend create a website. Then he starts to think his idea might really work. When his father hands him a check to pay his tuition in full he decides to create a real college. He leases an old dilapidated school building that was once a mental facility and creates a college--dorm rooms and all. The plan just keeps going and going. Students enroll and they even find a dean. Before he knows it he has thousands of students show up at the made up school. The film is hilarious and comes from the same studio that released American Pie. I really loved this movie. DVD special features include Deleted Scenes Gag Reel Reject Rejection-The Making of Accepted More The film's soundtrack is pretty hot too and includes songs from Modest Mouse, The Hives, Citizen Cope, Weezer, and Ryan Adams among others. Accepted is rated PG-13 and is now available on DVD. 
I don't know why people are writing essays on this particular movie, but I thought it was pretty funny and entertaining. I enjoyed it. Some parts could've been funnier than they were, but for the most part, the movie did it's job....MADE ME LAUGH!!!! 
My friend Suzanne took me to see Accepted three weeks ago, probably to celebrate my new hire as an adjunct lecturer in the English Department of Queensborough Community College. In the movie, high school graduate Bartelby Gaines--a name with literary overtones, at least the first name--can't get accepted to the staid Harmon College in his hometown in Ohio, or to any other school. To get his parents off his back, the inventive Bartelby (Justin Long), using his computer, invents an acceptance letter from the South Harmon Institute of Technology (get it?). Bartelby, to complete the ruse, gets his computer-savvy friend, Harmon freshman Sherman Schrader (Jonah Hill) to create a website for the bogus school. But the website works too well, and Bartelby is faced with hundreds of college rejects looking for acceptance. So in the confines of an abandoned mental hospital, Bartelby and friends create a college--really an adult education center or community center--where students design their own courses, design clothes in the school colors brown and blue (get it?), create the school newspaper the SH**rag, build a state-of-the-art skateboarding rink, and listen to radical lectures from a washed-up ex-professor (Lewis Black). However, Harmon College's traditionalist Dean Van Horne (Boston Public's Anthony Heald) and the fraternity brothers have reasons to close the new school down. Sure, the plot is improbable--as one TV reviewer said, "Haven't they ever heard of community college?" But if you look past the silly plot and over-the-top episodes, there's a real message hear about academic freedom, creativity, and appeal to students. In my years at CUNY and even at Pace University, I was never subject to the extreme whitebread culture of Harmon College, and I'm not sure I want to be. Even beyond the college trappings of Accepted, one can see the battle between the desire to mold oneself into acceptability by upper-middle class, status-driven White America, and the desire to be oneself and build toward a true calling by following one's heart and interests. Perhaps we teachers can cull some real lessons from the looney bin of Accepted. BTW, Accepted fully exploits one or two curse words--and excises the rest. 
(2.5 stars) First time director Steve Pink has written the screenplay for two wonderful films, High Fidelity and Grosse Point Blank, so as a director, I would imagine that he would have to read the script before deciding to make a film. Either he had a case of blindness the day he read the script, or he didn't read it at all. Also, he didn't take the time to research writers Adam Cooper and Bill Collage, who, while still relatively new to the game, hav been responsible for one of the worst films of the decade (2004's Olsen disaster, New York Minute). Being said, Accepted isn't the worst film of the decade, nor is it even remotely in the worst films of the year category. Rather, Accepted is a seriously ambitious film, with a plot "as thin as Nicole Richie on a fad diet", to quote Richard Roeper. That statement couldn't be more on the money. To retread other reviewers, at the beginning of the film, Sherman Schrader (played by Jonah Hill, whose thirty second role in The 40-Year Old Virgin was hysterical) says to main character Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long, of such bad films as Herbie Fully Loaded and Waiting...) "This will never work." And it won't. There are holes in every part of the film's design. None of this will ever work. It's impossible. So, then, I pose the question: Why make a film out of a plot that would in no way shape or form ever work? And please don't answer my question with some stock answer like: "Well, it's escapism. It doesn't need to work." Which may be true, in some cases, if the screenplay is written properly. Accepted's is not. Every character (with one exception; more on him later) is a complete stock character, drawn from every teen/college movie ever made. Bartleby is the slacker type, who, done right (see Ferris Bueller), can actually be funny. There is Schrader, the fat kid that gets picked on, and in this film, made to dress like a sperm, a hot dog, and scores of other things. There is the Tomboy, or Rory in this case (played by Maria Thayer, of the wonderful "Strangers With Candy"), who nobody seems to see as a beautiful woman (and she is very beautiful), but as one of the guys. Also enter the Token Black Guy (to use terminology from Not Another Teen Movie), Hands (played by Columbus Short). Of course, no "main gang" character list would be complete without the wierd kid that nobody understands, or in Accepted, Glen (Adam Herschman). The film is also riddled with gross out humor, and to keep quoting Richard Roeper (from his review of Waiting...), "You can do gross out stuff and still be funny, but it has to have some decent dialogue and characters." So, you ask, why am I generously giving this film 2.5 stars if it seems like I hate it so much? Well, Accepted does have some irresistable laughs, and it sort of grew on me, but only because of the things it has to say about the education system. In college, you are required to take high cost classes that you don't really want to take, but are forced to anyway. Why not let kids take a numerous amount of classes to figure out what they want to do, and still have it count for their degree? But, the way Bartleby and his gang go about it is too loose for college freshmen. If freshmen had as much freedom as this college allows, they would be passed out every night and never actually learn anything. There are more kind of commonsensical things that the film says about our seriously damaged educational system, but I'll let you discover it on your own. The only thing that kept me in the theater long enough to hear some of the insights was the what had to be improvisation of the brilliant Lewis Black. There is absolutely no way that these screenwriters could have written such brilliant rants and raves. It had to have been improvised, and besides, if you have listened or seen any of Black's stand-up shows, his dialogue sounds much like his philosophies. Black plays Ben Lewis (aptly named Dean Lewis), Schrader's ill-begotten uncle, who used to be a college dean, and now works in a shoe store. It isn't long and Lewis is fired and helps in Bartleby Gang's plot to start a college. With all of this information, I leave the decision to you. Weigh heavily the points I have outlined and determine if you want to spend nine or ten dollars to see this in the theater, or if it might be better to wait for it to come out on DVD. I can't really lean either way; this is definitely a personal taste film 
Accepted is quite entertaining. It works as a mashup of Animal House without the bite, and Nerds without the overstatement. While fairly predictable, it manages to avoid standard Hollywood development. The lines are good, delivered well, and reasonably believable. Accepted never takes itself too seriously, and neither should we. There are some fairly strong shots taken at the crumbling industrial age establishment. Most are well presented and reflect the growing disenchantment with tertiary education. One particularly strong point made is that the primary purpose of a college degree has become personal marketing. Today a degree is just a tool to get a job. There are some obvious flaws in the reality of the show. Most students that miss both their primary and fall back schools would just go to a community college and then transfer after two years. If you have a diploma from Yale - few are going to question if you spent all four years there. Being unaccredited is not a crime. Many colleges such as Bastiat Free University are proudly unaccredited. The crime is the fraud of stating you are accredited when you are not. With Internet access the costs of maintaining accreditation infrastructure is becoming an unnecessary burden on students and the school. Self-directed learning is coming of age. The movie Accepted is a fun loving fulcrum for levering in that reality If you can overlook the artistic license taken the movie itself is enjoyable. The ideas so softly presented should resonate with perceptive visionaries. As the industrial age bureaucracies deflate or implode, technologically empowered individuals will fill the void. Accepted takes the dull vagueness of that prior statement and provides it with a well honed comedic point. Accepted is worth watching 
This is the first novel of John Grisham and like the movie, it's very strong in characters and dialogue. At the time he wrote it, there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer' movies. "Witness for the Prosecution" comes to mind. And we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like Parker, Crais, Lehane, George, and Grafton. But the legal-mystery novel was uncharted land and Grisham plowed it over with a passion. How was Grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given "evil empire" writers like Len Deighton and John LeCarre fits, eventually the public would tire at lawyers, even laughing at them? Nevertheless, it's a good book and also an excellent movie. If there are drawbacks, then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust. The lawfirm itself for example. Sexual misconduct in a lawfirm? Sure. Misconduct in billing? Always. Stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains? Occasionally. But murdering associates who try to leave? I don't think so. (But it does give Department of Justice cop Ed Harris a great line in the movie, "McDeere, no one has left your firm alive!") The movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it. The lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn, the this time not very grandfatherly Wilfred Brimley, Holly Hunter, always a hoot, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook and Law and Order's Steven Hill, to mention a few. And Tom Cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and Abbey's rainbow has a HAZMAT sticker on it that he's overlooked. Cruise is just great. A true Hitchkockian character, the average man with no where to run. What would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom? That's The Firm. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur 
Nothing can be better than "The Firm" written by John Grisham, who himself is a lawyer. The attentions to details that Grisham manages to pull are just fantastic. I read the book before watching the movie, and hence can compare and tell that the movie has been directed perfectly and in fact a lot more interesting than the book, as the book gets slow in between, but not the movie. Cruise's is superb, so are the other actors in this movie. I don't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios. This is a movie based on a fiction novel, and as rightly said by one of reviewer here;it does its job by entertaining the audiences. 
The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie. Most of us don't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers, and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot. The good guy, Mitch McDeere, wins over evil not only because he's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck. Mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.For example, Mitch's wife gets to know all of a sudden that Gene Hackman's character (who has important documents to copy) is not going to dive as Mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him. Well, good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life. At the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer John Grisham. The movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished. In real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail, even less killed by the good guys; everybody knows this. What not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems. The movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into. Finally, the suspense is well organized. Moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes. Yes, this is very compelling movie to recommend watching. Beware that this movie deals at some degree with the Conservative vs Liberal cultural war. The bad guys had to be the Southern Conservatives who want to rule other people's lives according to their own hypocrite standards. Meanwhile the good guys are Liberals from NE. I wondered how writer John Grisham could portray his own Southern fellows in negative ways. All I guess is that JG realized what would be accepted by the Entertainment industry and wrote according to it. Anyways, this is just a movie and it does what it's supposed to do: to entertain 
This is a smartly written and fast-paced drama. Tom Cruise plays a sharp young Harvard grad lawyer who must use all his skills to out smart the mob. Great supporting help from Gene Hackman and Wilford Brimley is chilling as one of the mob security directors. 
The Firm, it`s a great story, and an amazing movie. i`v read the story, and just now, i watched the movie. it`s great to read the story and then watch its movie, you`ll be able to see what you imagined while reading the book! i recomend the firm to all! and if you can get the book and read it first, it`ll be more fun! Trust me! Enjoy 
I hate lawyers. What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!" Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW? What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment. So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner. Talk about contempt of court. Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't. Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks. Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. Otherwise, case dismissed. JS 
The DvD is great and so was the price. The movie is EXCELLENT!!! Can't stop watching it! 
I read the book and then re-read the book. I saw the movie not once but twice. It is somewhat different from the book. I like Pollock a lot, his movies are so interesting to me that I could'nt wait for the movie to come out. The acting was well done only one flaw. Casting Tom Cruise in this otherwise well developed movie. Everyone else does a great job of acting here. To me though, Tom is miscasted. He seems to be out of place. His thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but He just did'nt click of what Sidney wanted the character to be and do. Sorry Cruise fans he is wasted as far as I am concerned. Gene Hackman, and as well as Ed Harris they did well. A great movie but could have been better without Cruise here 
Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes. It gets stuck or restarts itself. Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
Good grief, this DVD was excellent! The commentary was fun and interesting. If the listeners would listen more carefully, the only part playing while they spoke was the intro over and over. Not much of the songs were missed at all. Are we Cheap Trick fans or not? I am!!! YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Encore!! 
I guess I didn't have the grandiose expectations that some CT fans did, because I think the FTTY dvd is super! Of course, this might have something to do with the recent purchase of my first dvd player (yes, very slow here to update to new...now old, technology)and purchasing my first ever CT dvd. I can understand those who may find this dvd lacking in comparison to previous releases. I've seen a couple of CT performances and listened to several of their cds... I love their songs, but I thoroughly enjoy listening to them talk about their life experiences etc. Sometimes forthright, often ambigous, they never fail to make me smile. Yes, it would have been a big plus for the band to sing more of their songs in entirety, but all in all, this did not diminish the quality for me. I was just wondering where track number 16 is... "California Man" ???? 
Cheap Trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today. They have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age! What other band sounds better 30 years later? After my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly. Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out. And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there's a great build up to the climax of each song. However, what's really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song. NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY. It's like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show. The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc. The closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs. That's exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show. Bonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety. Perhaps someday we'll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD. Update 6/14/05: Exactly a year later, I've still yet to pop this into my DVD player for a second watch, and Cheap Trick's still my favorite band. 
It as wonderful to enjoy Season 1 of Hart to Hart all over again. The black tie, the romance -- it was great! 
Hart to Hart! Great family viewing, spectacular scenery, great relationships of the characters involved. Our family especially enjoys looking for the clues to solve the crimes. Everyone can do this without undue graffic violence, obscenities or blatant sex getting mixed into the scenes. If you enjoy mysteries try Hart to Hart, Diagnosis Murder or Murder She Wrote just to name a few 
Well, now that we have two seasons down and I've watched all my disc over and over and over.... when do we expect the others to be released 
Hart to Hart is a modern day take on the Powell/Loy Thin Man. It has everything the Thin man did including the dog (Freeway)(except the baby). This 70's hit had adventure, romance and mystery all rolled up in an hour. Robert Wagner and Stephaine Powers seem like they are meant for each other. Tbey pair so nicely.The show created by Sidney Sheldon (I Dream Of Jeanne) and Produced by Aaron Spelling with Leonard Goldburg, and the quality shows through even years and years later Waiting for the seven seasons to be on DVD Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL 
I gave the item five stars (although I haven't viewed it--it is a gift), but this review is about NEW unacceptable Amazon packaging for this item. I ordered this item as a Christmas gift. I received it in a brown box with a shipping label. When the box was turned over, there was a peek-a-boo hole in the box approiximately 2.5" x 3.5" exposing the invoice. The order number, content information and price were ALL visible through the hole. If you are concerned about privacy or if you are buying this as a gift and wish to keep the contents secret from another household member, you may want to purchase this item elsewhere or make plans to be the only one picking up the mail until after it arrives. I have purchased MANY things from Amazon and this is the first time I have received anything in this type of box. I hope it will be the last. 
I have to agree with the positive reviews already posted. This is the best quality TV-to-DVD set that I've bought so far! The DVDs are nicely packaged in 3 slim cases, 2 discs per case. Each disc is single-sided (yes!) with nice graphics on the non-playing side. I've only watched a few episodes so far, but I was very impressed with the picture and sound, and also appreciated that the DVD started right up with the feature menu, and I didn't have to fast-forward past a bunch of previews (commercials). I hope other studios use this Hart-to-Hart set as an example of how to do a DVD release right 
I was just a kid when this show was on... and I loved every episode of it. Back then, it looked sleek, chic, exciting, everything you could ask for from a tv show... just like Charlie's Angels... or Vega$... I remember them all... Almost 30 years later, it looks so dated... so different from today's fast paced, violent, end-twisting, loud, in-your-face TV. STILL we love it. The stories are so simple... and Wagner and Powers had so much charm... so much style. Let me add that today I guess I still secretly dream about having a 1978 Mercedes-Benz yellow wagon with that big telephone (laughs). It used to be so super cool!!! Wathing those episodes made me feel again like a 6 year-old kid just being introduced to late 70's television - the jokes, the kitchens, the hairdos, the telephones, VCRs, big cars, disco... Oh, and I loved Mark Snow's theme. I recognized it instantly... And Max's introduction to Mr. and Mrs. H... whose hobby is murder!!! Do you want to know what were the dreams of the middle class' during the late 70's? Watch Hart to Hart. Everything was great. Everything was ideal! What a great show! Thanks for the memory. PS... someday, someone will write a History of american society through the 20th century's TV shows' point of view. I'm sure Hart to Hart, Charlie's Angels, Moonlighting, Magnum PI (and many many others)will all have a lot to say. 
Hart to Hart: Second Season to be released in September. Finally, hopefully the other seasons will follow in a timely manner 
Love it! Love it! Love it! Hart to Hart was one of my favorite shows growing up. I watched it each week. It so good to see the show again. I could not find the episodes anywhere on cable. The only thing is now I need the additional seasons!! 
"Hart to Hart" in eine in Deutschland sehr beliebte Fernsehserie, die seit Jahren fast ununterbrochen im deutschen Fernsehen gezeigt wird. 
the film was excellant there was lots of action, there was also great well known actors in it to, there was no bad langauge and no sex scene's 
If youre ever in the mood for a laugh out load comedy, don't bother with Wedding Crashers, The Bench Warmers or any other pathetically boring movie. Rent this and laugh the whole way through. That's exactly what me and my friend did last week and I have to admit I was laughing so hard I would have to pause the movie until the laughing fit ended. This really is one of the best comedies of the last decade. Highly reccomended 
Patrick Swayze + Meatloaf + Randy Travis + Trucks = Pure unadulterated awesomeness 
For pure testosterone pumping action, BLACK DOG is a slammer. The truck chase sequences are exciting and you find yourself rooting for the underdog hero, convincingly played by Patrick Swayze. Randy Travis and Meat Loaf chew up the scenery, with Travis coming across a little more believable than the histrionic Meat Loaf. But the movie moves well and has some great action sequences. A little over the top at times, but BLACK DOG delivers what you would expect for this type of film 
Sometimes you've got take a movie for what it is and what it is meant to do. Although I notice a majority of the reviews here are positive, some people just don't get it. This is a fun, action packed 2 hours(approx.) The DVD widescreen transfer is awesome and the 5.1 audio will blow you away!! The only thing I have to say negative about the movie is the ending. Kinda leaves ya goin' "Huh?, That's it? Okay.." Check it out 
When i watched Black Dog for the first time i thought is was one of the best movies i had ever seen. Now that i have seen it i watch it over and over again. What makes the movie so great is that it has awsome soundtrack to go along with it. From Randy Travis singing "My Worst Fear" and Rhett Akins singing Eddie Rabbits "Driving My Life Away". I would recomend that everyone watch this movie at least once in your life. I would expecially recomend it if you are a truck driver your-self. It is so easy to comprehend with what they go through. Even if you arnt a truck driver your-self it gives yo a little respect of what they have to go through(just hopefully not so much drama) with dealing being away from the ones that you love, for just doing the job that they choose to do 
This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I bought the movie and the soundtrack is awesome. Excellent truck driving in the movie. Very exciting, it kept me intrigued through the whole movie as to what was going to happen next.The acting is very good. Patrick Swayze is such a handsome man, he was the best part of the whole movie, but everyone did a great job.Red and his men got exactly what they deserved.If you enjoy a good action movie....then you will enjoy this one.I would rate it a 10 
This is a good action movie. If you have never driven a truck, then some of the details of the film probably will be lost on you. However, anyone who likes action and the trucking lifestyle should enjoy this movie. I give it "two thumbs up. 
The movie's plot is simplistic. Jack Crews (Swayze) and Earl (Randy Travis) must deliver a load of illegal weapons or the terrorists kill Jack's family. In addition, they must fend off Red (Meat Loaf), a fanatical, Bible verse- yelling madman, and his redneck thugs, who are attempting to steal the cargo. Anyone who enjoys explosions and big rigs will like this movie. Red's men try to hijack the guns several times, and each time their attempts fail, usually with some impressive crash. In fact, all of Red's crew are either blown up, splattered all over the pavement, or crushed within a truck cab. There are some good lines about how juice causes gas and what ATF really stands for. It's not the most intellectual movie out there, and Swayze's facial expression never does change, but with the number of explosions and huge trucks, who cares? In any event, you'll find out how deadly trucking really can be 
Considerng the adult humor and partial nudity, I was lucky as a kid to even be allowed to watch this movie on cable, especially since the "Blue Lagoon" came out shortly beforehand. My parents probably thought this was an innocent little film about mermaids. Some 22 years later, the movie still manages to be funny and charming...plus, now I get all the jokes. Who can resist a tale about finding the woman of your dreams who turns out to be more than what you bargained for? If you watch the credits at the end of the movie, you'll see the underwater city that Madison came from, something I had never noticed before. Ron Howard, Eugene Levy, Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah and John Candy probably never this movie would be the platform for making them huge A-list stars some twenty years later. This is a classic and a keeper. Future generations will enjoy as well.  
I have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because I wanted my kids to see it. I was very young when I first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow. Good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in Asia. Daryl Hannah played a beautiful and believable mermaid. Tom was also perfect for the role. I can't say their chemistry on screen is as perfect as that of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, though, but it wasn't bad. I can't imagine any other actor for the lead role in this movie. I let my kids watch it finally together with my niece. We found ourselves teary-eyed in the end. It was just so touching, we couldn't help it. Even the theme song sang by Rita Coolidge was perfect for the ending. For those who wanna know, the title is "Love came for me". I'm glad I purchased the anniversary edition. I have a home theater and the dolby 5.1 surround sound was just what I needed. It would have been better if DTS was used but I'm not complaining. For those who are thinking of getting this, I hope you make the decision to do so. Tom Hanks is a certified great actor. This movie will soon be in line with the classics like "Gone with the wind" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's". It's already a collector's item. You won't regret it! Besides, love stories don't get out of style 
We rec'd the Splash dvd and were quite a way into viewing it when it just went digital garbage -- all our other dvd's seem to work alright and we have a laser disk cleaner and try to run it through regularly -- i already threw away the container -- we will run the cleaner thru again and see if it clears up the problem - this is the first time we've bought a dvd that had a problem - we've always been very satisfied with the amazon service -- and products as well. thanks for asking pgammon 
This was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I decided to buy it for a girls night out. It went over very well. I even watched it with my husband, who found it very entertaining. Extra features on the DVD are interesting, but don't add a whole lot to the film itself 
How can people imagine a man change to mermaid ?! ha ha ha Tom Hanks did it 
"Splash" is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the 80's that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then. I actually saw this movie when it was first released, which is rare for me since I was only a kid back in the 80's and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days. I first bought it on VHS, eventually upgraded to the bare-bones DVD, and now have upgraded yet again to this 20th Anniversary Edition DVD. I just can't get enough of this movie. Both Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah have excellent chemistry together and make a great screen couple. What's also believable in this movie is Daryl Hannah's mermaid costume, which looks so authentic that one almost believes she's really a mermaid. And let's not forget the movie's ending, which is absolutely perfect. There's one thing about this movie that I've never understood though: how did it ever manage to escape a PG-13 rating? In the scene where Daryl Hannah arrives at the Statue of Liberty buck naked we get to see quite a substantial (and may I add, very nice) shot of her buns. Definitely not material for a PG rated movie. In any event, I guess that will always be a mystery. All in all, "Splash" is a true classic film that never gets old no matter how many times one sees it. Everyone is great to watch, including hilarious supporting roles by the late John Candy (R.I.P.) and Eugene Levy. Now if only they would release a special edition DVD of "Big," another Tom Hanks classic 
Ok, this is basically all you need to know: Daryl Hannah is a mermaid. That right there is reason enough to own this movie. She's also wet through a good portion of the movie. Oh yeah, did I mention she was a mermaid 
What really good fun!! My whole family enjoyed these Dvds to the fullest. Really wonderful, with the feeling of Rome and a personalized view of the history. We often travel to Italy and this was a "taste" without the trip 
Everything about this show is awesome. The script is well tight, the actors are 100% terrific, and the production makes you really feel like you are watching things happen in Ancient Rome. I loved watching this show on HBO not only because I love ancient Rome but because I was very interested in the characters. Anybody who studied the time of Caesar in high school will know what happens to the major characters. But in addition to the real stories, this show is full of drama, sex and violence. Then again so were those times. People were not as afraid of their sexuality as they are today, and people didn't think twice about watching people die in an arena. The Romans, and this show, really make you feel the exhileration of life -- and death 
An excellent series. Well presented through the DVD format. Worth the time to watch and worth the money to purchase 
I was 'hooked'to this DVD collection from the get go. My husband and I are history freaks, but we have kids, and many of the scenes, especially the first dvds, were too explicit. I don't recommend it to families with small children, though. We had to wait until they went to sleep to watch an episode. Still, each episode left us wanting for more. The scenes were spectacular, with many details of Ancient Rome. However, when you have good knowledge on the subject, you can tell that not everything is right on the money, or on the historical facts, I should say. Still, it was a great production 
I found this item to be an excellent source for a look at daily life in Rome. While it does abbreviate the historical events it is still a real look into the political undercurrents of the times. The nudity would make this not suitable for children 
Really captures the grit, violence, sex and intrigue of ancient Rome. I also love that it featured characters of many social levels - usually we only see the lives of wealthy Romans. Well acted, well written, great costumes and sets. ...and the women are beautiful, which was a plus for me! 
Great acting, direction, costumes, story, editing, and great special features. The commentaries are interesting with none of the "wah wah wah, boo-hoo me" or just "me, me, me" from the director which has ruined so many other movie commentaries for me. ... Well worth the money since there are so many hours of fun. Always want to watch it all again a month later. Five big stars. HJ 
The series was extremely well done and provided a well-scripted dramatization of Caesar's struggle for Rome. Cast was outstanding and the costumes, scenes, and overall production quality was very high. There has to be praise for HBO's taking an historical topic and translating it into a 12-hour series. The only reason I didn't give five stars for this was because a couple of the episodes lacked the "punch" that I expected from each, particularly following the first two episodes 
I can not say anything bad about this series, it was masterfully written and directed 
This is an exceptional series which got lost on TV. Trust me this is agreat series, well worth your time 
Edwin is a great songwriter/storyteller/musicain. Live at the House of Blues is a very good DVD. Edwin has a loyal following, and if you are just a casual fan, you might be converted to the Edwin Army after you view this. While I am sure some fans would like to have their Edwin favorite tune included on this DVD, lets face it, there just isn't enough time to get them all in one show or DVD. With 14 performance songs and 5 additional tunes on the bonus CD, this is a great DVD/CD to experience what a loyal group of followers already know. Edwin can sing a story! Edwin picked a place not to far from home in a venue that showcases his strenghts well. I enjoy the banter between songs. The band is always excellent. Most of these folks have been playing with him for quite some time. They are tight. Pete Riley does a fine job on backing vocals. As far as song selection, just because it doesn't have several I would have loved to hear/see, i.e "Go Be Young", and "What Matters", I am not going to count that (see remark above). My choice for favs on the DVD are My Mystery (The opening tune), I'll Be, and Maggie May. If there is one little thing to nit pick, it would be the quality of the camera work on the DVD. There are some jump cuts and the far shots of the band playing make it not as crisp as I might have expected. Again, I am a fan, not a producer/camera person. It is something that just strikes me, and I am probably alone in that. Botton line is this is a excellent purchase. Even better, if you have a chance to see Edwin live, by all means do it. Either way, you will want the DVD. It is a fine representation of what The Edwin McCain band is and how fine of concert they perform 
 Scream and Whisper is awesome, but if you haven't gotten the new DVD, "Tinsel Tap Shoes," you are missing out. The DVD is the answer for everyone who has been asking for a LIVE CONCERT on DVD. And to make it better... there is a bonus audio CD in the same package. Get S first... then buy the DVD. Don't pass go don't collect $200. This DVD was filmed over 2 days at the House of Blues, N. Myrtle Beach... one of my favorite Edwin venues. BOTH nights were magical, and they picked the best-of-the-best for this DVD. IF you have never seen Edwin and the band LIVE, this will give you a HINT of what you can expect to hear and see in person. You will NOT regret buying this DVD!!!! (...)

Once in a decade or so comes a talent this huge. That Edwin McCaine can write from such a world-weary perspective belies his age. Song after song, his words touch the heart, bringing forth tears of both joy and sadness. And that's just the lyrics. The voice. How can it be that one so young can sing with so much soul? Song after song, delivering just the right emotion to drive his poetry home. The perfect balance of melody and driving soul. Don't for a moment try to group Edwin's music in with the talentless, marketing packages that are so prevalent these days. His talent eclipses any 50 of these combined! On to the DVD. I found this to be an excellent sampler of Edwin's music. His band consistently kicks out the songs, with nary a wrong note. Personal favorites are "Coming Down" and "Shooting Stars". The high point of the DVD is "Beautiful Life", in which Edwin's band cuts loose. If I had anything to complain about, it would be that though every song is delivered impeccably, the band plays it all a little too safe for my tastes. the exception is the aforementioned "Beautiful Life" which shows what they're capable of. I only wished they'd stretched like that on a few more songs. So, if you haven't hit the "Buy Now" button yet, go ahead and do it - you won't be sorry. While you're at it, pick out a few of his CD's. There's nary a bad one in the bunch - a further testament to the talent of this young man! 
Edwin McCain is arguably the best lyricist and songwriter of the last decade. This DVD catches he and his band in a period of rebirth in their music. These are songs to capture your soul 
I too was at that concert! It was such an intmate playing space and everyone was so excited. It's awesome to see that others who were there posted here on Amazon. It was a great way to end a vacation. I highly recommend this DVD, the performance of Gramercy Park Hotel, one of my favorite songs was just fun and the other ballads and songs were beautiful. Buy this DVD and go find him live. Many bands don't understand the importance of live music, but these guys do! Enjo 
I have been following Edwin's music for the past 7 years. He doesn't seem to tour much out West, but I was able to finally see him live in Reno on October 26th. Edwin was so genuine - autographed 5 of the CDs I had by him. He was incredible then, and this DVD shows what a dynamic performance he can give. His live show included all of the songs on this DVD. If you have bought his latest CD, "Scream and Whisper" you will love the live performance of "Shooting Stars." He does an awsome cover of Rod Stewart's "Maggie May." Larry Chaney and Craig Sheilds really come through on this DVD also. Can't miss on this one 
If you sort of like Edwin McCain, get this DVD, watch him live, and you will fall in love. He has such passion for his music that can only be seen, and felt during live performances. His amazing voice, is just as amazing live, and he and his band, can JAM!! The energy is high, and its a great time! I had the priviledge of meeting him, and blubbered like an idiot, but he is just as cool a guy as he seems. He really appreciates his fan base, and understands how important it is for us to see him live. Im glad that finally, I can share with my friends who have never see Edwin live, what an amazing artist he really is!!!! 
Although this DVD hasn't been released, I know it will be worth every penny spent! I was at this concert...and as usual, not a disappointing moment! Edwin's CDs are incredible anyway but his live performances are incomparable...his ballads are moving, his upbeat songs get your feet tapping and his chemistry with his band is second to none! If you have never seen one of his live shows...buy this DVD and then log immediately on to his website (www.edwin.com) and find out where you can see him ASAP! His live performances, whether they are full band or partial, are experiences you never want to end 
I know the DVD has not been released yet - but I attended the concert at the House of Blues in Myrtle Beach, SC when this DVD was recorded and WHAT AN AMAZING night of music! Anyone who has ever listed to "I'll Be" has got to check out this DVD. Then RUN to your local CD store and purchase all of the Edwin McCain Band's albums. You will NOT be disappointed. The Edwin McCain Band is so much more than a "ballad - band". You will NOT be disappointed 
I am an avid ER fan and have been enjoying seeing the series for the second time. I rate it as one of the best TV series ever done. I am really looking forward to seeing the rest of the series and would like to know if you have any idea when "ER - The Complete Fifth Season" will be available for purchase 
The fourth season is one of the best. This is ER when it was still "pure".... all of the Old Cast was still in place along with some new standouts. 
I will say right now that this review will probably be much longer than the other three I have written, which were all pretty long themselves. But I just finished watching this season after getting it for Christmas, so it's very fresh in my mind. Season four of "ER" is excellent and exciting dramatic television, but I must say it doesn't quite live up to the standard set by the amazing first three seasons. Do not take this as a negative, however. For the most part, this season is excellent. The only problem is a handful of episodes I could have done without. I'll start with the season premiere, "Ambush." This is the famous live episode that was performed twice, once for the East Coast, and once for the West Coast. OK, so yes, this episode is a marvel of television and a technical masterpiece and it's simply amazing that it managed to air at all, and also that they did it twice, in a row no less. However, I just don't think this episode is very good at all. In fact, I hate it. I think if it wasn't for the fact that it aired live, it would be counted among the worst episodes of the series, if not the all time worst episode. I'm sorry, but this episode is just completely cheesy and campy and really quite awful. It has a whole different look from the other episodes, being that it aired live and all, and the whole style is like that of a different show. I also think that the plot is stupid and unrealistic and only a gimmick for the excuse to show it live. Also, the drama in this episode is really weak. It feels more like a high school play than a serious, high budget television series. All in all, a big dissapointment. Fortunately, things get back on track after this disastrous episode, but there are still two episodes that lower the rating for me. The first one is "Fathers and Sons" and the second one is "Family Practice." I have heard of people who like these episodes a lot, but I am not one of them. I believe the show is called "ER" and to have two episodes that don't even take place in the ER is just stupid to me. The acting and all in these episodes is fine, and we do learn a lot about Ross and Greene, but I just prefer it when the show takes place in the hospital. Plus, these episodes seriously lack the ensemble power of great "ER." The only cast members to appear in "Fathers and Sons" are Anthony Edwards, George Clooney, and Julianna Margulies, and then "Family Practice" has Anthony Edwards going completely solo! I don't understand why a celebrated ensemble show would have episodes with only three cast members in it (or just one, in the case of "Family Practice"). Aside from these episodes, though, "ER" season four rolls along smoothly. The adventures continue and the characters grow, for example: Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards): Mark has some real trouble this season. He's still all bent out of shape after the brutal beatdown he got in the previous season, and is still fighting to get the person he suspects beat him thrown in prison. Also, Mark has a memorable romantic fling with Mariska Hargitay, who plays Cynthia Hooper for an extended run this season. Doug Ross (Geoge Clooney): Doug and Carol are finally together in this season, after three seasons of being apart. Doug has plenty of excitement this year, and a top example is his relationship with Carol. Also, he illegally tries to help detox a little baby and gets in major trouble with Greene for it. John Carter (Noah Wyle): We get a large glimpse into the family life on Carter this season, when we meet his grandmother (played by the always excellent Frances Sternhagen) and his drug addicted cousin. Carter works hard to cure his cousin of his drug addiction, but in the end fails, and takes the scoldings of his family members. Carter also has some romantic tension with new-to-the-cast Del Amico and makes a controversial decision with a known rapist. Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies): 'Tis an exciting year for Carol. She comes up with an excellent plan to offer a free nursing center for poor people in the ER, and asks for the help of Carter's grandmother. She also deals with commitment problems with Ross and meets several woman who have been raped by the same man. Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben): It's another sad but intense year for the wonderful Boulet. She is now back with her ex-husband, but he eventually leaves to get a job somewhere else after being fired from his job in Chicago. Jeannie is left alone and forms a bond with Dr. Anspaw's sickly son. She also fights hard to keep her job after she is let go, and there is a good amount of tension between her and Weaver. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes): Weaver infuriates Boulet when she is forced to fire her, and takes some heat for this decision. She also has a romantic affair with a man who wants her to invest into another company, but ends us betrated and angry. Anna Del Amico (Maria Bello): This interesting character would unfortunately only be around for this season and this season only, which makes it hard to really get into her character. For what it's worth, she does get some very interesting storylines in her only season, including romance with Carter. She also deals with her only personal beliefs in an episode where an abortion clinic is bombed (one of the best of this season, by the way). She also has hardships when her old boyfriend returns to town. Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston): Season four introduces this character, who will be around for quite awhile, which we are all grateful for. Corday has a year of thrills when she comes to America to work at County General. She ends up in a romantic relationship with Benton and fights against the snide comments of resident jackass Romano. Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle): Peter learns what it means to be a father in this season as he takes care of his new baby. This brings out an interesting new aspect in Peter's character. He also dates Corday and this leads to some excellent storylines. So, there you have it. Season four of "ER" has a pretty large cast, as you can see. Although Sherry Stringfield is gone, we get the addition of two new characters, bringing the total cast up to nine characters. Despite my negative comments earlier, I would like to state that "ER" season four is a prime example of the show's brilliance and an excellent year for those seeking classic "ER." The DVD continues the high standards set by the previous three seasons. The episodes are in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen (except for "Ambush," which is still presented in fullscreen format) and the picture quality is excellent. The extras are actually my favorite of the four seasons currently out. The documentaries about "Ambush" are actually far better than the actual episode, and give you a good idea of what a remarkable job it was to create this episode and put in on the screens. The post shows for both versions of the episode are very interesting, too (if a bit too self congratulatory, especially from John Wells). What can I say? Although I liked the first three seasons better, season four is not far behind, and is an excellent year of "ER," truly. Pick it up today 
ER is a classic. However, George Clooney makes it eye candy as well! Eric LaSalle is also eye candy, however George has a soft spot in my heart. I was watching him back on the first ER he was in with Elliot Gould. Anyway, ER is great, although not as great after about season 6. The earlier episodes of a series are usually the best, look at Friends 
From the incredible success of the season opening live episode "Ambush" all the way to the crazy father shooting his family in the season finale, ER's season four was full of fantastic story lines, great writing, phenomenal acting and just solid television. ER has been my favorite show for years and this season, like the one before it, was one of the strongest on record. Viewers got to see into the lives of the characters and even welcomed a few more people to the County General family. The season premiere, shot live twice, once for the east coast and once for the west coast, was a true inspiration, an idea hatched by series stars Anthony Edwards and George Clooney. Writer Carol Flint found a great way (a documentary crew is in the ER shooting) to write cameras and such into the story and from there, it is all the actors, as they shine in their moment in the sun. This season brings some changes to the county general staff. Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) is promoted to interim chief of emergency medicine after Dr. Morgenstern (guest star William H. Macy) has a heart attack in the season premiere. Her management style is quite brash and certainly irritates those who have to work for her. Her decision to first hire, then not, an outside management firm was made even more difficult by the fact that she was dating the man who was trying to bring the program into county (guest star Clancy Brown). Elizabeth Korday (Alex Kingston) comes across the pond to join the County General staff as a fellow under Dr. Robert Romano (guest star and future series regular Paul McCrane). Her introduction to American television is the live episode, but her character goes through a lot in her first year. She fights off the advances of Dr. Romano, instead chasing after fellow surgeon Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle). She gets a first hand look at just how different things can be in the United States, and as the season ends, she finds herself looking for a way to stay after Romano doesn't renew her fellowship. Maria Bello joins the regular cast as Anna Del Amico, an ER resident. She guest starred in the end of season three and in season four finds herself in a budding relationship with Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle). She also finds herself at odds with the filmmakers in the live episode and deals with the returning of a former boyfriend as the season comes to a close. Dr. Benton has to adjust to life as a father after having a son in the end of season three. He also pursues a relationship with Dr. Korday and makes a career-threatening move when he questions the work of Dr. Morgenstern, pushing aside the senior doctor in a bold surgical room move. He also has to deal with his son's mother Carla (guest star Lisa Nicole Carlson) moving on with another man. Dr. Carter had a trying year, as he had to deal with the drug addiction of his cousin Chase (guest star Johnathan Scarfe) and also had to deal with humility when he decides to cut himself off from his family's money and has to go back to being an intern after switching from surgery to emergency medicine. Perhaps the shining moment of this season is when Carter takes control of the ER after a toxic mishap, and shows just what kind of doctor he can be, something viewers got to see for years after. Dr. Doug Ross (Clooney) also didn't have an easy year, as he went up against Weaver with the suggestion of a pediatric ER department with himself as Pediatric attending. The situation is still unresolved at the end of the season, but it is just one more thing to put Dr. Ross at odds with the bosses. He also suffers the loss of his father in a car accident in Californnia, which leads to a great episode where he and Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) travel to California together. Of course Ross wouldn't be complete without nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies). As the season begins, the two are in a secret relationship, but the truth soon comes out. Carol grows tired of the patient care and opens a free clinic in the ER, thanks to some timely funds from Carter's grandmother (guest star Frances Sternhagen). She also assists Ross in a questionable procedure at the end of the season, one that puts both of their careers in jeopardy. Dr. Greene pays a couple of visits to see his parents, bonding with his father (guest star John Cullum) on a second trip when his mother is ill. Mark is also still recovering from an attack in the men's room in the previous season, making him question just about everything in his life. He gets in a relationship with desk clerk Cynthia Hooper (guest star Mariska Hargitay) and battles with Weaver over numbers of things, a normal occurence in the world of my favorite character on this show. Finally, PA Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben), my least favorite character in the 12 years this show has been on the air, has to deal with her firing because of budget cuts. She believes its because of her HIV status and sues for her job back, which she gets. Her husband leaves for Atlanta and she forms a bond with the son of Dr. Anspaugh (John Aylward), a young cancer patient. I just never cared that much for this character, mainly because I found her to be selfish in a lot of ways, but maybe that's just me. This season featured a number of great guest stars, including many who went on to star in shows in the future, or came from past shows. Cullum (Northern Exposure) was great as Mark Greene's father. Harold Perrineau (Lost) does a turn as the father of a critically injured boy. George Eads (CSI) plays a paramedic with a thing for Hathaway. Hargitay (Law and Order SVU) is fantastic as Cynthia the desk clerk. Sternhagen (Cheers) is great as Carter's stoic grandmother. Jorja Fox (CSI) continues her recurring role as Dr. Maggie Doyle. A number of great actors had spots on this show and this list is only a partial listing. As for extras, there are two features on the live episode, including one that was filmed immediately after the two live episodes. The other feature talks about the work that went into the live episode and how they pulled it off. There is a gag reel and a number of deleted scenes as well. Since this is my favorite show, I am bound to praise this set, but anybody looking for quality television should look no further than this 
The much-celebrated fourth season of NBC's long-running medical drama, ER, is the recipient of two 1997-1998 Emmy awards, three 1997-1998 Screen Actors Guild awards, and one 1997-1998 Golden Globe award. Fans of the show will be treated to roughly 16 hours chock full of trauma intertwined with personal and professional relationship trials between the doctors, nurses, support staff, and patients. The unrated six-disc set includes 22 episodes, Spanish and French language subtitles, and numerous special features including outpatient outtakes, a "Cutups" gag reel, "Anatomy of an Ambush", and the "Ambush live post-show". Outpatient outtakes allow viewers to watch deleted scenes straight from the cutting room floor, while the "Ambush" special features include analysis and discussion of the live episode as well as the subsequent celebration among the cast and crew. The fourth season is ripe with talented and beautiful actors - some of the most adored cast members in ER history. The primary cast includes returning favorites George Clooney (Dr. Doug Ross), Anthony Edwards (Dr. Mark Greene), Noah Wyle (Dr. John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Nurse Carol Hathaway), Gloria Reuben (P.A. Jeanie Boulet), Eriq LaSalle (Dr. Peter Benton), Laura Innes (Dr. Kerry Weaver), and Maria Bello (Dr. Anna Del Amico). Also returning are Paul McCrane (Dr. Romano), William H. Macy (Dr. Morgenstern), and John Aylward (Dr. Anspaugh). New stars to the ER this season include Alex Kingston (Dr. Corday), Mariska Hargitay (Cynthia Hooper), and Yvette Freeman (Nurse Adams). Recurring and special guest stars include Lisa Nicole Carson, Telma Hopkins, Dan Hedaya, CCH Pounder, Chad Lowe, Jorja Fox, Alan Alda, Harold Perrineau Jr. This season also plays host to intense storylines, and, of course, emergencies. The DVD set begins with the legendary "Ambush" episode-ER's live season opener. Additional ighlights of the season include: Dr. Greene dealing with the aftereffects of his mugging, his estranged family, and his wavering feelings for Hooper; Dr. Ross losing his father, and potentially his fianc and career; Physician Assistant Boulet dealing with HIV and the stigma associated with it; Benton's relationships with his newborn son, his girlfriend Carla, and his budding relationship with Dr. Corday; The negative impact Synergix (an ER management firm) has on the lives of the staff; Carter trying to cope with his drug addicted cousin and personal issues with the remainder of his family; And much more! The fourth season ER DVD is a must have for die hard ER fans, as well as for anyone who just loves a well-written, well-established drama. 
Season 4 is excellent in that many new exciting story arcs are introduced. I loved the addition of British Dr. Corday and her new forming relationship with Benton. Carter deals with his addict brother, Doug tries to wrangle in Hathaway, but she shows her growth as a person. Jeannie is fired by Weaver (that old stick wielder) but stays her ground. Green still deals with his attack and begins dating Mariska Hargitay, etc. Make sure you purchase this set at your local Target, since they offer it the cheapest ($29.99) and give you a bonus disc of the East Coat airing of "Ambush.

Everything was rolling along just right by season 4. The actors were more comfortable with their roles and with each other. This was a great year. I won't go into too much detail, and get to my point of writing. I just got this set today at Super WalMart here in Asheville for $34.84 plus tax. The release date is 2 months away, yet they not only had it, but had it on the shelves and on sale cheap. How odd. Oh, well, won't have to wait until december now 
Disney DVD has announced 4 episodes that will be included in this collection: 1) "The Fourth Anniversary Show" : 1957 DISNEYLAND season opener, originally aired 9/11/57 on ABC. 2) "I Captured The King of the Leprechauns" : this last DISNEYLAND episode of the 1958 season was a big promo for the Darby O'Gill movie, originally aired 5/29/59 on ABC. *** This has already been released as a bonus on the Darby O'Gill DVD. *** 3) "Kodak Presents Disneyland '59" : a long thought lost TV special, not part of the DISNEYLAND series. This is well worth getting this set for! 4) "Disneyland 10th Anniversary Show" : from the 1964 season of Wonderful World Of Color, originally aired 1/3/65 on NBC. *** This has already been released on a Disney Treasures DVD Tin called "Disneyland U.S.A." in the first wave! Sure that DVD is out of print, but It is disappointing not to have a new to DVD episode included here. There are SO many episodes in which Walt plays a major part, this DOUBLE DIPPING is regrettable! *** Disney says the other episodes are yet to be announced 
A very successful comedy. Highly recommendable. Players are magnificent. Especially the final scene involving Kevin Cline's dancing act is unforgettable. Enables people to overcome deeply rooted prejudices about sexual practice.Sociological context significant.Leaves fine trails in spectators' brains 
Fun film about Kevin Kline as a teacher who discovers he's gay and decides he must cancel his upcoming wedding. Scene with Kevin kissing Tom Selleck acting as a newscaster is hillarious as well as the scene where Kline is listening to tapes on how to act masculine. A movie you will want to see more than once. A film to add to your library of DVDs 
In Greenleaf Indiana, something strange is happening. Everyone is turning gay, or so it seems, as a High School teacher is outted at the 68th annual Academy awards, on National television. The most surprised person is the teacher himself who wasn't quite ready for such a bombshell to be dropped. After all, he is getting married....... or is he? A hilarious comedy starring Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Debbie Reynolds, Wilford Brimley, Matt Dillon, Tom Selleck and Bob Newhart. This production is top notch all the way. The all-star cast is fantastic. Joan Cusack gives a stellar performance as the jilted bride. There's not a dull moment and you will be totally enthrolled in the plot right from the start. If you'd rather not see Tom Selleck and Kevin Kline in a hot, steamy kiss, well, get over it. It's hilarious. Terrific acting, great plot, very enjoyable to watch. A great addition to your home video collection. I highly recommend 
Kevin Kline and Joan Cusak are excellent in this film, that will make you laugh, no doubt about it! 
This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I love Joan Cusak and she was so fabulous in this movie. I've never paid much attention to Tom Selleck, and this is the first time I have ever seen him without a mustache, and he looks so gorgeous in this movie! It was great. Got a little preachy at the end, but the rest of the movie made that part worth it 
I quite enjoyed watching this film, which is why I give it four stars, even though I think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic. So, why did I like it? Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Kevin Kline (in that order) and also a passably funny script -- at least one that is well structured for a feel-good viewing experience. Joan Cusack is wonderful here. Her blow-up at her wayward fiance after he stands her up is fantastic, and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street, screaming "Is this the Twilight Zone?" at which point she collapses on the hood of Matt Dillon's car (in her wedding dress no less) -- well, that scene is adorable, especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet -- a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity. Yes, here is the heart of the film (so I cannot comprehend another viewer's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film; she's obviously going to marry the movie star, and get to eat cheetos into the bargain). Matt Dillon is, as ever, the essence of cuteness, and a much more desirable husband than Kevin -- um, I mean Howard. Kevin Kline does a decent job of mimicking Howard, a repressed gay man. But it still feels like mimicking, rather than acting. Here is also where the problems begin. I guess wearing a bow-tie means you are gay. And, similarly, the Barbra Streisand gag is beaten to death (and beyond). How many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like Barbra??!! Come on! Also, Kline's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture . . . Not only is it not enough; it's really kind of humiliating. Nonetheless, the final scene does give "Mr. Holland's Opus" a run for its money, and I can't deny it: I did really have fun watching this movie. It's basically a sound little production, well structured, reasonably well written, and Kevin Kline can dance 
Sitting down to watch this film a hige smile came across my face just about ten minutes in because once Kevin Klines charactor is outed by his now famous student Kamden (Dillon) the movie doesn't let up. I haven't seen a movie that kept me laughing so much in a very long time. Kevin Kline plays a English lit professor who, as I mentioned, get's outed by his former student while accepting an oscar for playing a gay charactor and so in the heat of the moment decided to dedicate the award to his professor "and he's gay" and at that point...hilarity ensues. You see, Kevin Kline is engaged to Emily (Joan Cusack in a scene stealing performance) and they are due to be married in just two days...so in those two days he needs to figure out if he's really gay. One surprising thing was Tom Sellick who doesn't even look the same without his mustache (he actually is much better looking and should keep it off) Tom plays a reporter who's intent on getting Kevin to out himself, admitt to himself that he is really gay, and all the while poor Emily isn't sure if there is even going to be a wedding. The movie is great from start to finish and it does touch on some deeper subjects along the line of gay tollerance and acceptance in our society. When Kamden outs his professor you get irritated when the priciple (played perfectly by Bob Newhart!!!) warns him that if he doesn't get married he'll lose his job. It's sad to see the way our society will treat something they don't agree with. All in all this is (as the tagline states) an out in out comedy, and an out in out good time 
Talk about comedy, the performance of Kevin Kline was terrific but the supporting actors really deserve rave reviews. Joan Cusak, Debbie Reynolds, Wilford Brimley and Tom Selleck were outstanding 
This one of the early gay plot films. I like it because it is light. I really like the main characters, Kline, Selleck and Cusack make a great ensemble 
This movie was very helpful in finding the facts. yet, it also provided information about the fiction. Both sides were fairly represented while also letting the viewer know when real factual evidence was available and when it wasn't. Not all of my questions were answered, but that is just history for you....all the questions that could be answered were in this movie, and those left unanswered showed both sides to the story.....i would recommend this movie for those who are confused about the davinci code or who just want to learn a few things regarding the da vinci code 
To be honest, I've never been that impressed by the kind of programmes the History Channel puts out - too much emphasis on entertainment and not enpough on decent research, historical accuracy, etc. So it was no big surprise to find this programme seriously "skewed", as a previous reviewer put it. This is a thoroughly lacklustre product which suffers from the same shortcomings that I already mentioned. So rather than waste my time and yours reviewing something that isn't worth watching in the first place I just want to direct your attention to "The Real Da Vinci Code" released in May this year (2006). It still isn't the definitive investigation - you'd need more than a couple of hours to cover all the relevant topics, but it has this offering seriously outclassed in every department- even as straight forward entertainment! 
This film repeats the basic premise over and over and over..it was so bad that I really couldn't believe it. The narrator talks about the holy grail being not a cup but Mary Magdeleine being the grail that carried not the blood of Jesus but the unborn child. It says she went to Egypt where she raised her child. Then is states that Davinci painted clues into his 'Last Super' which pints to the true relationship between Mary and Jesus. It speaks about the 325 AD council of Nicea and about the Sang Graal , dadocument which supossedly explains the true history of the christian faith. IThis poor documentary reapest the same footage almost all the way through this film..we hear the same quotes over and over. 
The first review was written by a high ranking official in the vatican seeking to keep the truth about the holy grail unknown. 
This DVD gives documentary coverage concerning such DA VINCI CODE topics as Rosslyn Chapel, the Priory of Scion, the Knights Templar, the Gnostic Gospels, Le Dossier Secrets, Da Vinci paintings, and Opus Dei. This DVD, BEYOND THE DA VINCI CODE seems to bend over backwards, measuring every narrated word, to try to support and be sympathetic towards the Dan Brown allegations made in his novel--despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary, they still seem to be in favor of what Dan Brown has written in the DA VINCI CODE. Out of a half dozen expert interviewees, the most notable are two "big" names who are MAJOR influences on THE DA VINCI CODE book. Margaret Starbird, author of THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR; and Richard Leigh, one of three authors of HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, (which was a NY Times Bestseller in 1982), both appear throughout this program. These two are probably the biggest proponents of the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy today, after Dan Brown himself. So it is especially meaningful when Richard Leigh and Margaret Starbird disagree with what Dan Brown has written! According to expert interviewee Richard Leigh, though THE DA VINCI CODE book says that the Knights Templar found documents to prove the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy, in reality, NOBODY knows what, if anything, was found by the Knights Templar in Solomon's Temple. Leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram, pentacles, 5-pointed stars as mainly representing the "sacred feminine" is NONSENSE--that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often! Richard Leigh also explains that the original Priory of Scion was last referenced in 1619, but the modern day Priory of Scion people from the last 50 years are "bonkers," trying to present a hoax of the LE DOSSIER SECRETS, to try to gain political influence for themselves. This LE DOSSIER SECRETS, which appears on the bogus "FACT" page at the beginning of THE DA VINCI CODE book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of Jesus, but has been debunked for decades in France. It does NOT belong on a page titled "FACT" in the DA VINCI CODE book! That is very misleading, not factual. Brown says the LE DOSSIER SECRETS were discovered, but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney! Margaret Starbird, another major influence on the Dan Brown novel, says that even though she believes in the Jesus/Magdalene bloodline, there is NO PROOF of the bloodline lasting into the French Merovingian line of kings, circa the first millenium A.D. The documentary, using other expert interviewees and location footage, goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the Rose Line alignments being found in significant locations throughout THE DA VINCI CODE novel; as well as showing there is no evidence that Leonardo Da Vinci was a member of the Priory of Scion, let alone the Grandmaster; the rose is NOT the symbol for the Priory of Scion; and Opus Dei has NO INTEREST in the "secret" bloodline of Jesus/Magdalene because they don't believe it even exists. Sadly, most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show, in brief statements, before quickly moving on to the next topic; while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE book claims about the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy. Overall I was disappointed by this HISTORY CHANNEL DVD for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ain't so in the DA VINCI CODE book--though I am not surprised, the HISTORY CHANNEL usually sides against Christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows, in my opinion. A much better DA VINCI CODE debunking DVD is BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE, which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel's lies about history and Jesus 
I have heard a lot of hoopla about Dan Brown's fictional novel. Most of it is trash; people claim that Brown has opened the Pandora's box of Christianity, when, in reality, he has done nothing more than sway the fickle, while reinforcing the beliefs of those who have done the thorough research. Interestingly, History Channel's documentary about Brown's fictional novel is quite enlightening. Having read material from those involved in the Jesus Seminar, I feel that they are nothing more than a bunch of left-wing quacks. Yet, the people that took part in, and gained fame from, the Jesus Seminar are quite genius. Here is a group of people that have successfully made millions of dollars because of speculation. In fact, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie, together, could not have written better speculative fiction. Of course, the documentary shines a lot of light on this otherwise dark bit of pseudo-history. First, the documentary discusses the various "possibilities" of the historical Jesus. They take several books from Brown's cited list, which is located at the back of his book, and explore the possibility of their being true. Each book that Brown has cited, and sticks by, is nothing more than fickle assumptions based upon skewed views and beliefs. While I am not against speculation, because hypotheses push for research and discovery, I am against presenting something as truth when there is no real evidence. Even one of the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail makes an appearance of the History Channel's doc. What does he have to say about his own novel? He basically says that his books does NOT PROVE ANYTHING; all he is attempting to convey is the POSSIBILITY that there COULD be a Jesus royal blood line. To sum up the documentary: the history channel does an excellent job of exposing the pure speculation of Dan Brown, and all others involved in accusing Christians for not seeing the "true" historical Jesus. While there are some questions that historians still need answer, as with anything that is ancient, Jesus still stands the test of time, firmly. I was surprised by History Channel's position to repute the claims of Dan Brown, and the Jesus Seminar, but they do, and very well, too. Take the time to sit and watch this great documentary if you are unsure, skeptical, or scared about what Dan Brown's novel has to say about Christianity. You will not be let down.  
This documentary is a very interesting work about de controvertial ideas over the Ocidental History wich we can find in books like "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" and, of course, "The Da Vinci Code" 
Watching Samurai Champloo is, at times, an uneven experience. Watanabe brings his audience exactly what they expect: quality. The music is a stellar mix of traditional Japanese folk songs and hip-hop beats. The art is beautiful and the story line is engaging. The characters are interesting and fully developed by the conclusion of the series. In certain ways Watanabe has improved on Cowboy Bebop. Samurai Champloo leaves no gaps in the lives of the characters or the motives behind their actions. Watanabe fleshes out the story line completely and evenly. The journey of Fuu, Jin, and Mugen moves steadily and the conclusion lasts three episodes; the most important segments of the show take place over more than one episode and have a much more prolonged affect. And unlike Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo effectively introduces elements of past history into its story line: the Satsuma Rebellion and the Tale of Heiki/Genji for example. However, Samurai Champloo suffers from overflow. No anime in recent memort has provided its audience with side characters of such depth. The villians and friends they meet on their journey feel as real and as significant as Fuu, Jin, and Mugen. But there is simply too many of them and they occupy too many episodes. Episodes such as "Baseball Blues", "Cosmic Collisions", "Art of Altercation", "Beat Box Bandits", and "War of Words" have too many eccentric characters and are not relevant to the story. They are single episode stories that drag down the flow of progress. A single season show shouldn't feel like it has filler episodes to reach 23 weeks of airplay. In certain cases - these side-stories provide great entertainment. My favorite episode happens to be a single episode story - "Gamblers and Gallantry." But more often than not, the audience may feel like the series is dragging on with extra filler adventures that affect neither the three main characters or the audience to any great degree. Despite this weakness, I do highly recommend the show. Watanabe does not let his creativity become a distraction nor does he let his refreshing take on the "hip-hop samurai" become a gimmick. Watanabe nails all the core elements of story telling and animation on the head. Just be prepared to watch some filler before you get to the meat. As a sidenote-do not pass up "Misguided Miscreants" and "Elegy of Entrapment." They are the highlights of Watanabe's work in any show 
Wow, so I loved this series in the original japanese, but after watching some of the dubs I have to say, Bang Zoom Entertainment did a pretty bang-up job getting the essence of the series down. I think the chosen voice actors fit the characters really well and that it didn't seem cheaply done or overdone in any way. That's really hard to get down, I think, and as I fan of subs only most of the time, I can't help but commend Bang Zoom for the work they did on this title. I approve. 
I'm not big on anime, but watching one episode got me hooked. The voices, the animation, the story, the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch Samurai Champloo. Each and every episode just engrosses you deeper and deeper into the story line leaving you wanting for more. 
Come and get it! Samurai Champloo Kung Faux are building bridges between hip hop Asian pop culture. Are you ready to cross it 
Samurai Champloo has to be one of the best new anime series I've seen in the past few years. The characters are a bit predictable, Mugen and Jin being the samurai equivalent of The Odd Couple, and Fuu as the always expected damsel in distress, but the plot and over storyline is what makes this great. The hip/trip-pop and J-Pop soundtrack is well done, unfortunately, the soundtrack seems to be missing numerous tracks, I was someone disappointed after purchasing it. For anyone who followed Cowboy Bebop, I think this series will definitely win you over as well. Shinichiro Watanabe defintely left his mark with this series. I can highly recommend this for anyone who enjoyed Cowboy Bebop or is looking for something refreshingly new 
In my opinion this is one of the best manga series i have ever seen because it's a very good story that mixture samurais with hip-hop culture and it's also very funny. the caracters are very good i think Mugen is the most important, the bad guy, but my favorite is Jin, and i think that he is the most powerfull in my opinion he would win the battle with Mugen but that is only wath i think, we would never know. The girl is very funny and the mane reason of the sotyr afterall. This is a must, the only reason i gave 4,5 stars is that the series is too long, and some episides are not that good, but the end is incredible and episode that Mugen fights a guy that uses KI is also very good. One of my favorite series very worth it and very funny 
WOW! that's one word that comes to mind. WOW! ever since tenchi muyo was taken off the air, their has not been any anime shows that have interested me. for years i searched, never finding anything worth watching. then, i sort of gave up. i would occasionaly check adult swim for any signs of a new great anime but to no avail. then one night it happened: i saw the second episode of Samurai Champloo air on adult swim. at first, i wasnt paying attention to the words and action. i was looking at what had caught my eye when i was flipping channels: THE ANIMATION! the artwork was incredible!the colors that were used to draw the characters and the world they were interacting in made it seem real. it was almost as if it was a sitcom, with real people. only tis was completly animated. it was eye-popping!then, i started to watch the show itself and the show was great!!! anyway, since then i have been addicted to the series and i have six of the volumes. but alas, the last one (number seven) comes out this month on the 17th. the show is coming to an end. so anyway, im going to write reviews for each of the volumes and rate them. i rated volume one of samurai champloo below: episode one: tempestuous temperaments- jin, mugen and fuu meet for the first time. mugen is looking for a challenge and hears about three "bad asses" and sends some cowards to go get them. mugen however, does not know that jin has killed them already. mugen mistakes jin as one of the "bad asses" and attatcks him. a brilliant fight insues, and jin mugen and fuu end up travling together. i rate episode one a 10/10 episode two: redeye reprisal- mugen cut a mans arm off in episode one. in this episode, the man is out for revenge. the man recruits an ogre by the name of oniwaka to help him exact revenge on mugen. also, jin encounters a highly skilled assasin who has been hired to kill him. another great fight. and last of all, our modest (cough) fuu gets smashed. i rate this episode 9/10 episodes 3 4: hellhounds for hire part one and two- the three heros part ways but fate eventually brings them back together. jin is hired by a gang as a bodygaurd. mugen is hired as a bodyguard by a rival gang. fuu is tricked into capture and is forced to work in a broffel house. i give both episodes 34 10/10 thats the end of my review for volume one of samurai champloo. if you are new to the series check out my reviews for each volume to see if you want to get the volumes. i will say this, they are really expensive. but they are worth the money. i get them at best buy and they are 24.99 plus tax and each volume has four episodes on it. if you have not bought this dvd and are debating weither it is good or not, i reccomend you buy it. i can personally vouch for this dvd. of course, its always good to check other reviews by different people as well. later. i hope this review helped 
This has to be one of the coolest animes ever made. With the Director of Cowboy Beebop, the creators of the series have turned history on its head, as we join Mugen, Jin, and Fuu on their road trip in Meji-period Japan. Mugen, with his rough and ready back street fighting skills, and Jin, with his uncompromising elegant swordsmanship, help the young waitress in her journey to find the "Samurai who smells of sunflowers" in return for her saving them from execution, while also trying to find enough food to eat along the way. The most impressive aspect of this series as a whole is in its ability to change from heart-breaking storylines to extremely funny episodes. This anime shows us a totally different historical Japan, one that has the walking dead, baseball, and nude paintings. However, it grounds itself by also showing us the emotional background stories of the characters and the people they meet along the way. You really never ever know what to expect from one episode to the next, so the series is always fresh and never gets boring. The animation is very good and the creators have put a lot of effort to ensure their characters have detailed facial expressions. The voice acting is spot-on, with Mugen's attitude coming across brilliantly and the music is good. I love the song on the ending credits, however, the opening hip-hop tune takes a bit of getting used to. This is on of the top animes out at the moment and deserves to match the success of Cowboy Beebop. 
If you are bored with Kurosawa's faithful decpition of historical Samurai (and who would be?), if you think the Samurai genre has been overused and outdated...then get ready for the hip-hop remix version of the age old genre: SAMURAI CHAMPLOO. Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, the man who brought us Cowboy Bebop and 2 shorts in Animatrix, with character design by Kazuto Nakazawa, Kill Bill vol. 1 fame, we are treated to a world that would have made the Wu-Tang Clan feel right at home. The action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other. One follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play. The music is all modern hip-hop, no moody asian flare here. The story is about the adventures of these two warriors as they escort a pessant girl across Japan in search of a samurai who's only distinquishing characteristic is that "he smells like sunflowers." Lack of money, food, and patience is a recipe for disaster and wacky hi-jinks in this adventure-comedy. Rated 16+ (the equivilent of R in the US) for bloody violence and language. A must for any samurai genre fan 
i love anime, but lots of it cannot hold my attention. full metal alchemist and inuyasha are dead boring, but this anime is probably the best ever. (tied with bebop) this is a stylish combination of breakdancing and an akira kurosawa type movie. very nic 
Very entertaining! Except few scenes, I really enjoyed this movie. (but hey, nothing is perfect, right? except maybe LOTR...). You should buy this DVD or at least rent it, watched, and then decide. I watched it few times and I will more in the future! Good romantic comedy! 
I am really glad I bought this movie. I had the VHS but the quality is much better with the DVD (especially w/ widescreen 
Bend It Like Beckham is a very enjoyable coming of age film for teen aged girls. The film sensitively portrays a young Indian girl's difficulties in convincing her parents that playing soccer is a worthwhile activity that can help her develop her identity and well being. The film is enjoyable on several levels: 1) there is the cultural clash between Britons of various descent, 2) there is the hilarious "lesbian" mixup, and 3) the pure sports film. All in all a very enjoyable experience and a great film for young people 
Very cute movie and a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Set in Britain, you have Jess, a teenage girl of Indian descent, keenly interested in playing soccer (or football in Britain) and very good at soccer as well! She idolizes British soccer player David Beckham and dreams of one day becoming a professional player herself! Unfortunately, her parents are very traditional and don't want her playing soccer as girls of her age should no longer be interested in playing sports. Jess secretly joins a girl's soccer team after being spotted by another female soccer player, Juliet, who helps recruit Jesse to play for her team. Jess's parents don't approve, but Jess decides to play on the team anyway and not tell her parents anything about being on the team. Jess excels at playing soccer, enjoys playing soccer as it is her passion, and becomes fast friends with the girls on her team as well as her coach. She also does a lot of funny things in order not to be caught playing on an all girl's soccer team by her parents, but still gets caught anyway. It doesn't help that the coach for the team is a male! Pros: Cute, funny movie, with great storyline about friendship, family, love, and finding the inner strength be fight for what you believe in and following your dream. Cons: Predictable. Hard at times to follow the British accents and British slang 
Parminder is a remarkable British Punjaban who's more in love with football than the frivolity of her culture! She's a character that perhaps most desi girls will relate to. Her drive to do her best at what she aspires the most, is what takes a mere sport to turn into her life's biggest opportunity! Her mom dad could easily pass off to be mine haa haa...such is the close resemblance of character! Gurinder's best work to date 
Bend it like Beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you. This is a smart, funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for. I urge every mother to give her daughter this DVD for a birthday, Christmas or graduation gift. I think they'll thank you for it. Bend it Like Beckham follows Jess, a young British girl of Indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol David Beckham. She strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional Indian parents who want her to conform to traditional Indian culture. I love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family. She perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream. There are a lot of funny moments in this movie; I don't want to give too much away THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL. I love this movie; this is how movies should be made. The cinematography in this movie is amazing; the camera disappears and we see real life transpiring on screen. The entire cast disappears into their characters becoming real people you care about. Look for Keira Knightley in a supporting role. A Shawn James five star essential movie. Definitely get this movie along with the wonderful Muriel's Wedding, a great Australian film that follows a similar type heroine on her journey. 
This movie was very great. I enjoy Indian show but usually find them to be to long. This show added just the right amount of culture to it. It explores the friendship of two girls of opposite races and shows that people are just that people now matter what class, race,or sex you are. They also portrayed woman as strong and independent,I liked that 
Bend It Like Beckham was a very enjoyable movie to watch. It was inspirational and heart-warming for young girls with a dream in showing that you can be anything that you want if you work hard enough. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was great in the role of the coach. Parminder Nagra showed a wide range in her acting abilities, considering this is one of her first films. Keira Knightley sparkled in her role as a tomboy with a homophobic mother, bringing just the right amount of humor to the film. It was an all around sweet, yet touching film examining the influence of culture in a young girl's life. The film poked fun at the proper life of a young Indian girl growing up in a traditional household without getting too serious. The costumes were rich in color and the soccer scenes were well filmed without looking fake. All around, Bend It Like Beckham was an enjoyable and sweet romantic comedy. It's definitely worth the watch.  
Warren Beatty raps out the best work of his career both in front of the camera as Senator Jay Bulworth, and behind it as the film's director. Bulworth is hilarious, politically incorrect, and tells truths that come in the form of shocking interviews, and also in the form of a manic white-rapper phase that delivers his message. Halle Berry is at her hottest, most mysterious and intriguing, the streetwise kids in the ghetto almost steal the show, and a jumping soundtrack pops the movie right off the screen. There are a few movies that display so much insider acumen, "Wag the Dog," "Primary Colors," and "Thank You For Smoking" come immediately to mind. Bulworth is in an elite satirical league that could include "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," but to be more accurate it is in a tradition dating back several centuries that includes greats like Swift, Voltaire, Shaw, and even George Orwell. 
When this film came out, most reviews were respectful, but most of them really missed it. Beatty plays a liberal Senator who is being told by idiotic, overpaid consultants to "move to the middle" and be "centrist". These were just code words for "agree with the Republicans on everything, be nice to them, tell them they're wonderful, and tell the liberals in your party to go f--k themselves.". Bulworth was being instructed to sell out all of his principles, and sound like GOP-lite. Well, he hires a hit man to kill him, and this makes him start speaking the truth. Then he becomes a liberal again. Beatty saw through all that "third way, triangulation" crap that Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, and James Carville (to name a few) was pushing. Essentially, the Democratic party told its base to go to hell, to be more "moderate", to "reach out" to the Republicans, to be "bipartisan". But when you look at Bill Clinton's record, he was as conservative as Bush Senior (especially on economic issues). All those were code words for making the Democrats act just like the Republicans. It was BS back in 1996, and it's BS now. The Dems bought it hook, line, and sinker, and it alienated their base. If they had been a little more like Bulworth, they may have held onto Congress. Beatty is a hardcore, unapologetic liberal who thinks that government can do good for working class people, and he infuses this film with that message. Whether you agree with him or not, the film works very well. Only now do the Dems (and the left wing blogs) see through the lies that Clinton and his ilk told them. Well, Beatty was tellin' ya that in 1996.... 
please watch this movie as one who recalls the night of the shooting of Bobby Kennedy and the death of all and any hope, this movie which opens with Sen. Bulworth viewing his wall of RFK, MLK and Minister X, this movie says it all, right up to the shattering but inevitable ending. IT carefully and clearly lays out the issues in many ways, visually and verbally. Listen carefully to Halle's character's analysis, no matter how quickly it is spoken, and see her hopelessness briefly relieved by Bulworth, as also the excellenty Cheadle's character. Try this as a double feature with Bob ROberts and be afraid very afraid at what we see now in DC 
I like this movie a lot.Rated R for persuive strong language and drug use.Canada:18A and 14A[DVD Rating] 
If for nothing else, this film has one of the most memorable lines that you will ever hear in a movie. Bullworth is being interviewed and he comes up with a plan for "racial deconstruction". You can read it in full on the imdb website as the language is coarse. The film does raise interesting points for conversations regarding race and equity and unfortunately/fortunately these are issues that we are going to be facing for some time. Thus, the movie will continue to have relevance. Fortunate that the movie was made, unfortunate that we still have problems in this world based soley on the color of someone's skin 
I don't care what the Hollywood media machine has told the world about this annoying and worthless film. Every character is a cliche. Warren Beatty and Halle Berry have NO chemistry! If this is what's left of his creative soul, he should just check into a home and get an alcohol addiction -- the anti-depressants are overwhelming his common sense. The only redeeming quality is Oliver Platt's natural comic presense. But that does not make up for this film insulting every ethnicity, culture, community, and individual in America, not to mention all of our intelligences. I was so disgusted and nauseated by this film's arrogance and hypocrisy that I had to leave my grandmother's house -- she still finds Warren charming! If aliens were to see this movie as a first impression of us, we would all be gone in a flash of brilliant white light, which anyone who likes this movie would deserve. This movie makes me angry for living in Hollywood. By the way, Warren Beatty "raps" throughout this film, so have a trash bag and smelling salts handy. ZERO STARS 
Bulworth explores the term "politically incorrect" with uproarious results. Beatty takes chances satirizing hypocrisy and insincerity within our political system, but the gamble pays off with a zany film that has something to say. Not for all tastes 
Imagine turning on the TV news (CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, FOX, MSNBC) and hearing politicians actually speaking their minds and being absolutely (brutally) honest instead of saying what they're scripted / paid / obligated to say! Imagine the lobbyists and official handlers dropping dead from massive coronaries! BULWORTH is the sort of movie that makes you wish that all politicians were human rather than ideological automatons. We are so bombarded / brainwashed from both right and left that we take sides rather than balance them out! Warren Beatty is a liberal guy. However, this movie is hardly leftist propoganda! It is a cold slap in the face of politics itself, an indictment of a rancid system based on lies and dirty deals. A system fueled by billions of left and right wing dollars, seeking only to maintain the comfortable positions of it's members. BULWORTH takes aim and machine-guns the whole bloody mess! Imagine a world where politicians spoke from their hearts. Imagine them doing their true social duties, while working for a living! In BULWORTH, it takes a total nervous breakdown for his epiphany. If only real politicians had such breakdowns! I highly recommend this movie, but leave your liberal / conservative bias' out of it! They will only cloud things up! This movie would be a fantastic double feature with WAG THE DOG! Enjoy... 
Bulworth is ostensibly Warren Beatty's brave political satire in which a conservative senator suddenly starts liberally voicing those opinions that the rest of us are supposed to be thinking but are afraid to say. He tells a black church congregation to, "Put away the malt liquor and fried chicken and stop supporting running backs that stab their wives." If that's what you were thinking, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, Bulworth is jaw droppingly bad. To take such a hight position as to attack Beatty for suggesting that black characters need a white powerbroking partriarch to come to his senses before their concerns can be publicly considered is to give Bulworth way more credit than it deserves. It's distinguished from movies that are simply "bad" through its inclusion on the short list of truly dangerous ones. Not content to be racism hiding in plain site, Bulworth's racism is disguised as its own solution. Drug dealers have their transactions justified as the only commercial avenue open to otherwise well-intended African-American youths. Nina (Halle Berry) articulates an informed point, and it's a joke because attractive young black women look funny when they talk smart, like high-grammar versions of Zip Coon. In so doing, Beatty reminds black Americans that no matter what they accomplish, we know who they really are. However limited the potential of the opening premise (Bulworth plans his own assassination for insurance purposes before inevitably changing his mind), the film never approaches the kind of Farley Brotheresque world that would have been its natural destination. The sincerity of the politician's catharsis is hidden from us, both because his new outlook is originally motivated only by the insurance scam and because once Beatty starts rapping his lines, he NEVER stops, making the actor (as opposed to the character) look uncomfortable for the duration. That this movie lured audiences and critics into its didactic spell is astonishing. The film's ambition to be more than a cute little movie while being exactly the opposite reminds this reviewer of Roberto Benigni's embarrassing "Life is Beautiful" from the year before. Both have to be seen to be believed 
This movie is the quintessential example of how politics and public opinion rules the day. Each of the actors in this criminal injustice movie are compelling. Cusack's plight is what endears him to the viewer--restive in nature, the Louisiana boy attempts to save Pacino's administration and future but, is unable to resurrect him in the end. While Pacino is resolute in his hopes, dreams and desires, his role as the Greek mayor of New York City is plagued with a plethora of problems that he can no longer control. His prior associations for good or bad is what is his final Waterloo. This film is resplendent in its depiction of police and political depravity. This is a must see film for political science and criminal justice students. Most respectfully, Dr. Charles Thomas Kelly, Jr. Assistant Professor of the Administration of Justice Louisiana State University-Alexandri 
Cast: Harold Becker Cast: Al Pacino, John Cusack, Bridgett Fonda, Danny Aiello, Martin Landau, David Paymer, Anthony Franciosa, Richard Schliff, Lindsay Duncan. Running Time: 111 minutes Rated R for language and some violence. "City Hall" is one of those hopeful yet ultimately frustrating films that never really delivers toward its potential. It's as if the characters, the plot, and the pacing of the film were kept apart throughout filming, and then only introduced in the editing room. The film begins with a lackluster conflict, the accidental shooting of a child by a drug dealer with relatives in the NY mob families who looks as if he came directly from Central Casting, and acts just as stiff. Before we even know anything about this character, he's confronted by a possibly corrupt cop ( the entire background motivation and confusion regarding the cop's rational for meeting with the drug dealer alone, without backup and without reporting in first is left completely unresolved), gunfire is exchanged, and everyone is dead, including the innocent child, who is clearly injected into this formula for nothing more than aesthetic/emotional purposes, and is treated like "cinema-chum", shot dead for instant sympathy by the audience, only to draw in the bigger fish in the water, the primary characters. On the heels of the shooting, we are introduced to our principles, Al Pacino as the mayor, John Cusack as the deputy mayor, single-handedly managing the entirety of New York. The completely contrived setup of the administration of a city the size of New York being managed, at least from all appearances we are given on screen, by these two characters is beyond laughable, but insipid. The central plot of the movie springs from the reaction by City Hall to this one shooting incident, as the world is (we suppose) put on temporary pause for days afterward in New York by this event. Cusack abandons his supposed position with City Hall and becomes a knee-jerk Mickey Spilane, trodding beside Bridget Fonda on some half-ass investigation of the politics surrounding the now dead cop, suspected of corruption, and the question of why the drug dealer was ever on the streets in the first place, having been questionably released on parole years before. Everyone phones in their performances, which appears as if everyone approached the movie with high hopes, then got distracted by something better to do, (possibly calling their agents for better scripts once this movie started filming) and just showed up to through with the dialogue. Numerous gaffs, faux pauxs regarding life in New York, cornball accents by Cusack, Fonda's character operating with the depth of a spring puddle, vanilla backgrounds, boring dialogue (save Al Pacino's impassioned, yet ultimately weak tirades toward the shooting of James Bone and his personal conversations with Pappas) make for a really unsatisfying films; "City Hall" just can't deliver and feels like a TV movie of the week 
A complicated story line. John Cusack is new to me: a performance that only falters in the last stages of the film. John Cobb (Austin, TX) has said in his review, "I am not a big Pacino fan, feeling he only plays one character well, and that one I'm way past tired". I see what he means. The set characters and set pieces - down to the set music - grow increasingly hollow to the point that you wonder if Pacino was intending to sound hollow. This film should not work yet by the end you have been drawn into it. You have seen something not great but unusual and magnetic. You watch the credits feeling sombre. You hope that on one will talk to you for a while. 
Would have given "0" stars on this one. Boring and lacks any direction 
I watched the entire movie with my mouth open, glued to the screen. (Well, almost :) ). I have never before, and not afterwards, found a movie that was quite as good as this one in terms of captivation, plot, and the idea. The story sucks you in, and your brain is working the entire movie trying to figure out exactly what's going on. On my first take, I didn't quite get the outcome, so it took me some time and watching it again to really figure it out. The basic plot is about a guy who has an amnesia-like disability, where he does not remember immediate past events. The story progress backwards (!) from the end, and this technique makes you see the main character's predicament. Except we, as the viewer, see the 'future' and know what will happen to him next. I thought the actors were great, the director did a great job and, to quit raving about this movie, I have to say that it's simply SUPERB. Watch it and you won't be dissapointed. 
"Memento" eclipses everything which preceded it, and set the bar so high it may never be topped. And all for $5 million in production costs. Director Nolan does a remarkable job of juggling the complex plot elements, but sabotages himself with some of his rather ordinary visual schemes. I refer you to the diner sequence in which characters portrayed by Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano converse over soup. Given that the film was shot in Panavision's 2.35:1 anamorphic process, the scene would have played more effectively if Nolan had simply planted his camera for a medium shot of two skillful actors as they provided plot exposition. Instead, Nolan intercuts between close ups of the two, which is a method more typical of and appropriate for the narrower aspect ratio of television. Close ups work best when used judiciously and to provide emphasis. I mention this only because this is how detailed I have to go in order to find fault with the film. If I didn't know better I would swear that Pearce is an American actor--his accent is that authentic. All of the performances are convincing and it's always fun to see "Eve 6" (Harriet Sansom Harris) from that great "X-Files" episode. This film is proof of the morally bankrupt notion that movies have to cost $200 miilion or more. I am SICK of ugly, witless, loud blockbusters which are polluting pop culture. If the choice is to spend that sort of money making a movie...or allow the movie to go unmade... "Now, where was I? 
Memento is the ultimate whodunit mixed with time-space conundrums. It swallows up the competition in this department, but maybe that is because it's near overload. Forward, back,.Two steps back one step forward. After a while it feels like I'm watching Jeopardy! I'm always getting the answers, and finding out how they turned out that way can end up being half the fun. The movie centers on a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who is trying to put together clues to figure out what is happening to him. His last real memory is of his wife dying at the hands of an unknown assailant. The movie starts out showing us Leonard in a motel room going over various notes and messages he has written to himself on pieces of paper, his hands, and various Polaroid pictures he has taken. Leonard seems to have his short-term memory "reset" after every 17 minutes or so. The result of this memory loss comes from the accident that took place when he tried to stop his wife's assailant. Memento is one you really have to pay attention to, and I'm not kidding. However, you'll catch on to the pattern after a while, which makes it even more fun. The show will jump back and forth to show Leonard in various stages, and then show us how he actually got there, why he wrote down what he did, and if he is in fact, coming closer to getting an answer. Paranoia seems to set into the theme well as we, the viewers, can never be sure who to trust, let alone wonder if what Leonard is writing down will lead to his success or ultimate demise. The "Facts" that he gathers are tattooed onto his body with a bic pen and a needle (kids, don't try this in study hall). Along the way there are two other characters that are with him in his dealings of these issues, one is a guy named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who may be a hood, or a cop, or neither. The other is Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who seems to be in her own troubles deep enough, and yet is somehow connected with Leonard. As far as independent or "contemporary" filmmaking goes, this thing is a masterpiece. Tight Script, in depth plot not muddled by tons of extras, effects, and poor dialogue. What you have is an amazing "trip" wrapped up in a puzzle inside a...okay you get the picture (no pun intended). I'm glad I...remembered (again, no pun intended) to give this movie another chance after my initial 17 minute viewing of it, whereupon I turned it off. Or did I just forget how it began? Again, no pun. Memento was written and directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2000 
This movie is possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies. This movie is very unique and will never get old 
"Memento" is a masterpiece of suspense. I highly recommend this film to all viewers. Guy Pearce portrays [Leonard Shelby] a former insurance agent who is trying to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The problem is that Leonard has short-term memory loss due to a blow to his head when his wife was attacked. Therefore, as a result, the character Leonard Shelby does not have the capability to remember anything within the last 10 minutes. Whenever Leonard has a conversion or reads something, he must write it down, or tape it or he will forget. To do this he resorts to photographing people he meets, and tattooing his body in order for him to remember the most important information which he feels will help him find his wife's killer. The interesting part of this film is that it begins at the end and then proceeds backwards in reverse chronological order. Joe Pantoliano portrays the character [Teddy]. And where Teddy's loyalties lie leave the viewer in suspense. The entire movie is a masterpiece in script-writing, and it is thoroughly worth the watch. I highly recommend this movie to all viewers. 
Awesome movie. Nolan is a genius. Mind-boggling thriller that changes your reaction since it's told in reverse. 
Memento is a movie you have to watch again to fully understand the roots of the story behind Lenard Shelby (Guy Pierce) and his relationships with Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) Teddy/John Gamel (Joe Pantoliano). Lenard has a condition in this movie where he has no short-term memory (not amnesia though). He can only remember things for about 10 minutes and then everything fades so he has to take pictures of things he needs/wants to remember and for the important things, he has them tattooed on his own body. He is trying to find the guy who raped and murdered his wife and you are shown a lovely picture at the beginning of the movie that shows a picture (won't say too much to ruin things for readers of this review who have not seen the movie and are interested) of Teddy shot in the head, but you don't know why this happened and the movie begins its sequences of going backwards in 10-12 minute sequences then moving into no-color sequences where Lenard talks more about his condition. Be sure that you have full concentration as you will need it. Overall, great movie 
junto con un "WTF!" fue lo que dije cuando abri el paquete con los dvd's.. su estuche en particular se parece mucho a una de esas carpetas de informes medicos en donde tanbien trae los informes del paciente... o sea.. que loquera.. eso no fue todo.. al poner el dvd fue lo mï¿½s frito que habia visto.. o sea.. ver para creer.. estaba mas perdido que quien sabe que.. y el segundo dvd fue peor, es mas complejo todavia.. de igual forma tuve que buscarme unas guias de como ver el dvd y poder todas las cosas que trae.. la pelicula es muy buena.. y la version de la pelicula que trae el segundo dvd tambien es muy curiosa 
Tyler Perry has done it again. As usual this was very funny. The music performances were on point. 
I love tyler perry plays and movies. He writes comical dramas. His plays are humorous, but there is always a lesson to be learned in them. His characters are well developed, and you feel like you know them as neighbors. 
This is life pure and simple.The joys,pains,glories and heartaches with God being the focal point in everything that happen 
I found this play quite entertaining. The 'old school' values that Madea offered were attractively packaged in her wit and contagious humor. I gave it 4 stars though because at times, the dialogue at the beginning was too fast, and I lost some of it. I also found that parts of the play were too long-winded; it seemed to lose momentum. Generally speaking though, a good, worthwhile performance 
I love to watch the Madea plays they are so funny but yet still send out a message to people. This play was funny all the way. My favorite line off the whole play was "Hello can I speak to Scooby Doo". This was a great play. Tyler Perry doin the thing. They should make a movie off of this play, hopefully they will 
THIS PLAY IS THE BEST. I LOVE IT. I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE FUNNY BECUASE TYLER PERRY IS JUST AN FUNNY GUY. I LOVE ALL OF HIS PLAYS. THIS PLAY IS ONE OF THE BEST. ALL OF HIS PLAYS ARE THE BEST BUT THIS ONE IS THE FUNNIEST. MADEA IS A TRIP IN THIS ONE. I NEVER SEEN THIS UNTILL RECENTLY. I'VE SEEN ALL OF HIS OTHERS ONE AND THEY WERE OFF THE CHAIN AND THIS IS JUST GREA 
i laughed so hard that tears came out of my eyes while watching this...i forgot that there is a man underneath the Madear costume..this is worth buying 
Once again Tyler Perry had me cracking up, but his message was right on 
I never seen a Tyler Perry play or DVD until I seen "I Can Do Bad All By Myself" DVD...and this is VERY funny and good...and the funnier thing is Tyler Perry gets straight to your funny-bone and you're into this and laughing your ass off, until you relize half-way thru this wonderful comedy, it's a Christian, message-driven play..but by then, reguardless of your spirituality, you're into it for what it is...a FUNNY ass play...PERIOD! I highly recommend this DVD for a great night of laughs...just don't invite Mr. Brown over for i 
I loved this play. Tyler Perry and his ability to make you laugh ( and cry ) is a blessing from God. You can watch this with everyone in your family. 
I watched all of these shows as a child. I still enjoy watching them just as much as I did back then. I've never heard my grandkids laugh so much. Great fun for the whole family!!! 
Not very good selections from the series I watched as a kid. Thr students in my class got bored of them after a few minutes 
Okay, we've had the racism discussion (ironic since there is no racial humor in the films in this particular set)-so back to RASCALism and the contents of these films. Fly My Kite is a nice 1931 entry. Sure, the plot about the gang helping an old lady fight off being eviced by her heartless son in law is hackneyed, but the Gang's personalities keep things entertaining. "Hook and Ladder" is a pretty funny remake of the 1926 Rascal classic THE FOURTH ALARM and sound adds to the humor hee. The Gang fights a fire and saves the day. "The First Round Up" is an amusing tale of the gang on a camping trip that goes all wrong. In the words of Scotty Beckett, "They'll Never learn." The last shot of Petey's eyes going buck wild is worth the price of admission! "Teacher's Beau" (Stymie's Next-to-last film) establishes the Spanky and Alfalfa team that would carry the series to its final years, and they do quite well as they try to stop their teacher from getting married. Look fast for a young Dorothy Dandridge. "Reunion in Rhythm" was filmed around the older kids (Mickey Daniels, Mary Kornman, Joe Cobb and Matthew "Stymie" Beard) returning for the Gang's 15th anniversary and they breifly interact with their successors Spanky, Buckwheat, et. al. as the smaller fry do a school play. But enough of this, just get it and enjoy. Beginner's Luck is classic fall-down on the floor funny Rascalism. Spanky's mother forces him to enter a talent show and boy-does she get her comeuppance (And how)! Alfalfa makes a hilarious debut and the Five Cabin Kids (a popular Black vocal group of children) jazz things up with their rnedition of "Dinah" (check out the little guy's Louis Armstrong impression) 
The job they did cleaning this up is great! The sound is low yet clear. The picture is clear without alot of "Floaters" in it.For as old as this reel is, it's in awesome shape! My kids love it as much as I ever did 
I grew up watching the old re-runs of the Little Rascals in the 1980s and watching those shows are some of my most vivid childhood memories. In retrospect, why can't viewers accept the fact that this show featured good, clean innocent childhood fun AND yet also had some racist undertones consistent with the times? To say this show wasn't groundbreaking and hilarious, is to ignore the facts. But to say that this show, looking back, didn't have some racist undertones is also to ignore the facts. Look at Amos-N-Andy. A large portion of the Black Community in the 1950s refused to watch this program because of its overtly racist undertones, and yet a lot of those same people will admit today that it's hard NOT to laugh at some of the humor. You just have to be honest and be real when watching old footage of Hollywood shows like these. I'll continue to laugh when I watch these episodes, but in adulthood, it's hard not to also think back to what living in the 1920s and '30s was like for my family -- it wasn't always all fun and games (and no doubt, we all know that TV Hollywood images have proven to be equally empowering damaging for a number of reasons). Little Rascals should serve as the ultimate history lesson. Great writing great comedy are timeless. This kind of racism, no matter how blatant or hidden,is dated. These DVDs attest to that 
For black history month, couldn't help sounding off about the ridiculous charges made in reviews here of "The Little Rascals" being racist. Quite the opposite, fare such as "The Little Rascals," depicting black and white children playing together, were extremely provocative in the racist South. During the Civil Rights era, children's book publishers caught it so heavily from both sides, blacks protesting the depiction of their race in books, and segregationalist whites protesting any suggestion of racial mixing, that people of color disappeared from children's literature entirely for a time. See the article here: http://www.library.unt.edu/classes/slis/_private/larrick.htm When they reemerged, in the late '60s-early '70s, it was cautiously. It seems a heavily PC agenda is still in force and seeking to rewrite history 
After making some major amazon purchases $500+ this week, I noticed one thing most of my purchases had in common: there was always someone posting negative reviews based on looking at all of these videos from a "racial" perspective. There are people out there who would deter you from buying "heart warming" videos like these, just because they are searching for a crusade. This is my 2nd attempt to place a review here. I spent so much time on my 1st one, that I couldnt even attempt to go into that detail again don't have the time. So I will be brief. In short, these are CHARMING films, that will make you laugh and remind you of what being a kid was all about in a simpler time. This series, and something as innocent as the "Our Gang/Little Rascals" series are American popular cultural TREASURES! ***It never ceases to amaze me how some people "go out of their way" to look for racism. These people keep agitating try to keep things stirred up. How many posts have I read this week in this vein? The black man is still oppressed by the white man. Lets' remember why we are here - - to buy videos, not rehash tired old stereotypes. Some reviewers are looking for a platform an audience to preach to. They do it on these reviews, and ruin this forum in the process. Something tells me they were indoctrinated into the victim mentality, and are brainwashed into believing that they cannot succeed in life. Some self proclaimed black leaders make a living doing this. Please disregard all of those rediculous posts. TAKE MY ADVICE and buy this series YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! 
I grew up watching the Little Rascals and adore this video. I am far from ignorant and will defend these videos till the end. Racism? What the hell are they talking about. Our Gang comedies were WAY ahead of their time. The fact that we are discussing them still some 75 years later is proof positive. Stymie, Buckwheat, and Farina are staples to the series LONG before african-americans (God forbid I say black) were in ANY TV shows. Tell me, where are the african-american characters in Gilligan's Island, Bewitched, Andy Griffith, My Three Sons, Lost in Space, Petticoat Junction, Green Acres, Charlie's Angels, etc. - or even as recent as Seinfeld Cheers. What is wrong with you people? These are great shows, absolute classics. The problem with people today as that they don't know how to laugh at themselves. Trust me, even if you have never seen the Little Rascals, this video is worth every penny and then some 
I am looking forward to all the racial slurs in the future releases. Not only are they hilarious, it shows how bad things were and how attitudes have drastically changed in favor of the politically correct viewpoint. No racism isn't gone. Guess what? Never will be. But it is so cool to see television before politically correct sensorship strangled the creativity and "time stamp" quality that is televisions greatest asset 
On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is "There's a time and place for everything", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you. Mind you it is a PG rating, so anyone 13 and under not without a parent. 
Would you believe I never watched it before this week? I've missed a lot of classics which I should have seen. So how did this one age? Quite nicely. Fine writing, laugh out loud funny situational comedy, many supporting actors and actresses who I recognized from elsewhere, funny hair, clever satire, solid content, garishly colorful clothes you have to love laughing at. At last I understand why Simon and Garfunkel, who I like, are so overrated. Anne Bancroft immediately became every schoolboy's fantasy, and Dustin Hoffman was brilliant in the starring role. I chose not to have sex as a teenager or a pre-teenager. But seeing Hoffman as a recent university graduate, all I could think was, "Damn, that kid needs to get laid." Even after he got laid. Great movie. 
You will want to buy this movie once you have see Madea's Family Reunion 
This reviewer has recently been on a regional-retro film fest of my own, watching the Minnesota branch of the Graduate's off-spring: (the Heartbreak Kid; Foolin' Around,) and decided it was high time to revisit their roots. I'm glad I did. The Graduate is still prime Boomer comfort and soul food. And I learned a lot from the extras on this "Special Edition:" For instance: Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin and Director Mike Nichols are *not* attempting some grandiose JesusChrist Superstar (Oops! Wrong Movie ;-) symbolism when Ben is pounding on the upstairs window in the church - it was a pragmatic solution to the real parish pastor's concern that they were gonna break his beautiful bequested glass if Dustin/Benjamin continued pounding on it like he had at rehersals - better to disperse the pressure! All in all, still fantastic after all these years! /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer 
I can remember sitting through back to back showings of `The Graduate' in a now defunct Whittier theater when it was originally released in '67. I was a sophomore in high school at the time and as I remember there were several reasons why I put in the extra time to sit through a second viewing. One reason was to see that incredibly sexy night club stripper (Lainie Miller) perform again. Hey, I was sixteen, raging hormones, you know the story. Anyway that was one reason. The other was because it was hilarious and there was so much laughing going on in the audience that I missed a lot of what was being said the first time. I had to see it again just to catch all the subtle jokes and comic nuances. Of course that was '67, how does `The Graduate' fair some 39 years later? Dustin Hoffman is still delightful as the naï¿½ve and somewhat awkward Benjamin Braddock, while Katherine Ross remains as lovely as ever. However with that said, I must also admit that the film appears to have lost some of the comedic charm and emotional pathos it once possessed. Maybe it's not the film, maybe with the passing of years I've simply lost my connection with that sixties angst this movie so perfectly reflects. Sadly, even the Simon Garfunkel soundtrack that so enthralled me when I was a teenager now seems somewhat out of place and dated. I quess what I'm trying to convey is 'The Graduate' may not be quite the classic I once thought it was, but it doesn't miss by much. I would still consider it to be one of the most memorable films of the sixties 
The Graduate is both hilarious and resonant, dressing the very real and consuming anxiety of young adulthood in the trappings of farce.It must be noted as well that our culture would be much poorer without The Graduate. Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson has become an icon of mature sexuality, aided in great part by the iconic, nostalgic Simon and Garfunkel song that shares her name.The Graduate is, in many ways, a fortuitous result of divine synergy and timing, with Hoffman bucking stereotypes to win the role, and Nichols at the top of his talent.The film is a visual textbook for filmmakers 
The Graduate has become a classic film, one that makes all those `top 100 film' lists. It stars a young Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin Braddock, a young man from a wealthy family, who has just graduated from college. He is in limbo, unsure of what to do with his time and where life will lead him. The Robinson's are his parents' best friends and it is their daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) who Ben's parents have earmarked as a partner for their son. However Mrs Robinson (played by a brilliantly predatory Anne Bancroft) has other plans and is set on seducing the naï¿½ve young man. When Elaine returns from college, Ben falls for her and ends his relationship with her mother. Predictably Mrs Robinson reacts with hostility and sets out to ruin both his relationship with her daughter and his life. Simon and Garfunkle provide the music in their inimitable style and the title song, Mrs Robinson, was a huge hit for them. Director Mike Nichols managed, in this film, to capture the feel and mood of the 60's flawlessly and he deservedly won an Oscar for his work. The DVD itself has few extras, a documentary by the director, interview with Hoffman, some trailers and the usual subtitles. The picture and sound quality are good, what you would expect from the format. This is a film that has stood the test of time and is still worth watching today. 
James, you wrote: "Ben is weak, immature, a stalker, lazy, has bad taste in women and at 21 is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends. Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!" Yes, Ben was weak, immature, and had bad taste in women. His learning to overcome his weakness, immaturity, bad taste in women, and then defy his family and Elaine's family was his coming of age story. That WAS the point of the movie. It went right over your head! The acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out! How could you not love this movie? Maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value. Watch it again in a few years. I think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time. 
I saw this movie as a child and it simply stole my breath away! This is from the age of great movie making in Hollywood! Black and white makes it even more dynamic! Considering that the major actors are NOT really Chinese,but made Chinese by clever makeup, it is even more amazing. They make their characters come alive and REAL! The story of a poor farmer living with his father, the story takes you from his wedding to a slave to his rise as a rich Landlord. The journey is the thing! The slave he marries is meek on the outside, but strong inside. She even goes out DURING LABOR to help save their wheat crop from the coming hailstorm! And it is done with REALITY although for its time, the special effects are amazing and devestating. A famine comes and they must kill and eat their beloved ox. It is the WOMAN who can only kill their beloved friend so they can survive. When someone offers pitance for their land, the woman kills her newborn child so they can keep the land and go to the city for a while to survive. It is the woman who finds a bag of jewels that propels them to a life of riches. There is a lot of happiness, heartache and truth in this movie. It will NOT disappoint. OUTSTANDING performances!! 
There were only Chinese in the background. Just like in Memoirs of a Geisha (the actresses - or at least the main ones where Chinese instead of Japanese) the actors and actresses in The Good Earth where not Chinese either. I certainly cried foul when in Memoirs of a Geisha Chinese actresses where asked to play Japanese roles. The actresses in Memoirs of a Geisha did not pull it off then and The Good Earth's stars Paul Muni and Luise Rainer did not pull it off either - sorry. Now, would the role of O-Lan have been better played by Anna May Wong is arguable. As a Chinese American - she was removed from here Chinese ethnic roots - or was she. Nevertheless, the point is there were only Chinese people in the background. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung, a peasant Chinese farmer. Conversely, Luise Rainer is O-Lan, his once slave now wife. This cinematic adaptation of the Pearl Buck novel (which is arguably the source of the problem) has Wang Lung and O-Lan trying to make their way in what is an epic battle against poverty, nature, and a whole host of other impediments - like their own personalities. Starting from scratch and building their land holdings up from nothing, then as the famine hit, losing everything. The family moves south only to slum it on the streets of the city. O-Lan - the perennial luck bringer finds a cache of jewels during a riot (in which she was almost killed herself), she and Wang Lung become the landlords once again. Wang Lung sets up a stereotype of the disloyal Chinese fellow who hurts his wife deeply - one who brought all the luck by engaging in a second, younger wife. To get biblical, our protagonists - using the skills gained by their young son - battle against a plague of locusts and win! Predictably (and it is all over the place) there is a tone of inexcusable jingoism in the movie. The Good Earth more a reflection of how we saw Chinese rather than an authentic rendition of the Chinese themselves. Muni and Rainer (who won an Oscar for this role) are miscast for the roles, and particularly the minor characters (many of whom are also played by Non-Chinese) do a terrible job of playing Chinese - they are all in caricature. One could only give kudos to a movie like this if (1) One thought this was a wonderful rendition of what we think Chinese are, and (2) One has never been to China. It is Orientalism and should be seen as such. Miguel Llor 
A B/W Film Classic. Excellent story and performances from all the stars, perhaps the acting style is a little dated. A very god qulaity transfer to DVD except for one scene that is a little grainy. I will watch this film again and again 
I read the book back in high school and thought it was amazing! I've always wanted to watch the movie and finally got it on DVD a week ago. I never liked black and white movies but this movie was excellent because the pictures were very clear and the sound was excellent. My only objection is that the movie left out lots of details that's in the book. But thumbs up anyway! Highly recommended 
I love this film. It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing. I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used. I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches. In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture. I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves. I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print . One of the worst I've ever seen 
as an asian american, i just want to say how well this movie is made. i'm not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors (come on people, this was in the 1930s!!) and yes, there are a few scenes that are not in the book. but, let's count how many hollywood movies (taken from books) that can't hold a candle to it's original masterpiece. i love the movie 'misery' but if you've read the book, the book outshines the movie by a landslide. so yes, the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book, but still a very well made movie nonetheless, particularly for the 1930s. i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd 
This movie exemplifies what was good and what was bad about Hollywood in the 1930's. The good part was that they could take a major work of contemporary literature and convert it into a major motion picture. The good was that they could create special effects like the swarm of locusts attacking the fields. The good was that they could adhere to a code of standards that enabled them to suggest sexuality without showing it. The good was that they could make a moral statement without hitting us over the head with it. The bad was the fact that they used Caucasian actors to play the leading Oriental roles. Paul Muni never came across as an Oriental of any nationality and no amount of make-up was going to make it happen. Luise Rainer came off fairly believable but to have Uncle Henry from "The Wizard of OZ" playing the venerable father was too much. The problem that Hollywood had for years (and, to an extent, even today) was that they couldn't seem to accept non-Caucasians in leading roles. Orson Welles plays Othello, Peter Lorre plays Mr. Motto, Anthony Quinn plays an Eskimo in "The Savage Innocents", Ricardo Montalban plays a Native American (and, in a bizarre twist, so does Woody Strode), Ben Kingsley plays Gandhi, and on and on and on. I realize that the attitude is that a big name helps sell the movie but why not let an Oriental play an Oriental, a Native American play a Native American. I don't think it was a lack of talent. I suspect it was a lack of interest. Having made those points, I would conclude by suggesting that "The Good Earth" is about 20-30 minutes too long but it is otherwise a very good picture. I believe that Luise Rainer was awarded the Best Actress Oscar for her role as Olin and I came away impressed that the award was well earned. 
"The Good Earth" must be considered a "milestone movie." As yet, there is no DVD but one packed with out-takes about the making of this film would be especially welcome. There was no Oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939; otherwise, "The Good Earth" would have 'taken home' that award! The lovely Luise Ranier did win "Best Actress" award. The 1937 movie was based on Pearl Buck's novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. Interest in "The Good Earth" was revived in Fall 2004 when it was selected for "Oprah's Book Club". Perhaps women's rights advocates should also give it a boost? The story is about China in the 1900s. A simple farmer, Wang Lung, is 'given' (by his father) the slave O-Lan, for his bride. I do not remember much from childhood about this film, but I definitely do not recall Paul Muni having such a mouthful of teeth! (special effecrs?!) Luise Ranier had won an Oscar the previous year for her role in the "Ziegfield Follies" -- what a contrast! Here she is the completely docile, loyal wife; as someone wrote, she was bound to her husband in "eternal servitude." And her devotion was betrayed. Partly through the machinations of "Uncle". At every time of crisis in the story along comes (GROAN!) the crafty, manipulatve uncle (Walter Connolly) who whines wheedles - - inserting humor (?) into the script and at the same time destroying family amity. From the Internet Movie Database are the prophetic words of former slave O-Lan: "When I go back in that house, it will be with my son in my arms. I'll have a red coat on him... and red flower trousers... and a hat with a gilded Buddha and tiger-faced shoes, and I'll go into the kitchen where I spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe, and I'll show myself and my son to all of them." (Smiles, contented) Wang Lung: "Well... Now, I... I haven't heard you speak so many words since you came to this house." Isn't the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago? I found the quality of framed camera shots surprising the production of many scenes quite amazing. READ Susan Wong's wonderfully perceptive review on amazon.com. Today's movie-goers don't seem to care about "true life" documentation in films, but animation couldn't convince as the 1930s true-life locusts do! That tired word "awesome" truly fits this vintage film: the choking drought famine, the beautiful 'condensed' story of harvesting when they must survive the fury of a storm, and the terrifying scenes of revolutionary uprisings. REVIEWER mcHAIKU HAILS THIS FILM, and others that made an impact on my childhood! 
Boy meets girl. Girl thinks boy is a little weird but interesting. Boy is mildly taken with girl. They part with a classic kiss that screams spontaneity. They meet again under circumstances that they can't have each other and the girl doesn't know what she wants, she's just irritated by boy. I won't ruin the ending, but it's a good one. This has nudity in it; my husband thinks I watch it to see Julian Sands in the buff. He might be right 
This has to be one of the best romantic movies ever filmed. Merchant and Ivory were masters at period films. The music, acting, locations, costumes were first class. One of my favorite movie scenes of all times is the playful scene of the vicar and the two young men frolicking buck naked in the pond in the woods. I laugh out loud every time I see the movie. There are so many brilliant moments in this movie, I never tire of it. I've had the video for many years, so, I had to have the DVD 
When I watched this film for the first time several years ago, I thought it was mind-numbingly boring. Now that I've become a big fan of film adaptations and, more important, period pieces, I thought it would be fair to give this film a second chance. A Room with a View is a beautiful, passionate love story that keeps real to E.M. Forster's novel. This is the story of Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) and the choices she has to make. Should she choose her boring, but socially approved fiancï¿½ Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis) or should she follow her heart and choose the adorable and passionate George (Julian Sands), whom she met during a trip to Florence, Italy? Should she settle for the demands and social mores of Edwardian England? The story is slow-paced and subtle. It focuses more on the decisions Lucy has to make. Some people may consider it boring. I, however, think it is one of the best love stories out there. The actors are all magnificent. Helena Bonham-Carter, Daniel Day-Lewis and Julian Sands are wonderful. The scenes where the men bathe naked at the lake is my favorite scene. Yes, there is explicit male nudity in this scene, but I like the fact that they show men frolicking in such an innocent way. I thought it was endearing and the acting wonderful. As for the rest of the cast, Judi Dench and Simon Callow are also great. The production is an eyeful. The wardrobe, sets, scenery (especially the scenes in Italy) and backdrop of the Edwardian period (this is not a Victorian, like other reviewers have said) are breathtaking. James Ivory and the BBC went all the way with the quality of the direction and production. This movie was released in 1986 and the DVD's digital remastering is excellent. It adds dimensions to this already beautiful film. If you love classic love stories and you're a period film enthusiast, I recommend A Room with a View. Only a true lover of the aforementioned things could appreciate this great film to the full 
See title; simply put, it's a charming film. Loved it - a very successful gift 
The mid-1980s was a banner time for E.M. Forster fans. Two of his novels, "A Passage to India" and this, "A Room with a View", were successfully and wonderfully adapted for the big screen. ("Howard's End" would come a few years later.) Forster had a genius for developing characters and for showing the awesome and sometime awful complexities that arise when people interract. James Ivory, thanks to a brilliant casting director, had the right actors to bring these characters to life on the screen: Helen Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, Simon Callow, Julian Sands, Daniel Day-Lewis, etc. What this permitted Ivory to do was to focus on another equally important element in film making: to give us something beautiful to look at. The shots of a small Engish village, the lusty Italian countryside, the polish of an upper class English garden are nothing short of breathtaking. It enhances the romance, heightens the humor (especially when an English minister decides to skinny dip with a few parishoners in a hysterical scene), and convinces us that this was how life was for these remarkable characters. One of the Merchant-Ivory's best collaborations, this dvd also comes with some insightful commentary and a unique look at E.M. Forster's life. I recommend it highly 
This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. It's funny and beautiful, with a perfect cast. The music and the scenery is breathtaking. I agree with a previous reviewer, I can't think of anything that isn't perfect with this film 
This has always been a favorite movie of mine-- enchanting, visually stunning and superb acting. But I have to say, I think that the digital remastering takes some of that enchantment away. At least with the audio aspect. Actor's voices have lost the human richness-- esp the women's voices which sound higher pitched and slightly annoying. Even the music and sound effects sound a little "off." So, it was sadly less of an enjoyable, enchanting experience for me watching this version. That said, I still love this movie, so I'm giving it 4 stars (minus 1 for the bad remastering). But this is just my opinion, so feel free to take it or leave it. Cheers 
I love this movie. For my 15th Birthday, My mom ordered it for me:) The Video Store lost the order and it took them 6 months to get it to me on VHS. Does that tell you how long I have loved this movie!!! I know the movie word for word!! Most Men do not understand it, (it has no action, DUH!!). It does not need it! It is beautifully written and the background (Italy, etc.) is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a wonderful dream to fufill on day - To run through a barley poppy field dressed in a victorian dress and carring a parasol:) I love the way Helena says the word Constantinople. It will be my daughter's name. Also the costumes and Hair in the movie is incredable!! For my wedding I had the hair of the Italian driver's girlfriend. I am a long haired blond, so it worked out perfectly. Helena still and always will be my favorite British Actress. This movie moved my in many ways and I even after almost 15 years nothing compares to this movie in my opinion!! Enjoy!!!! If you are a romantic at heart let the romance take you away for a few hours: 
I would have given this film 0 stars if possible. This film was long, boring, and painful to watch. If you like Jane Austen films or other BBC period films, do not be deceived by this one; it is nothing like those types of films 
I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young children, because of the nudity. 
These movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies. From a horror movie fan's perspective, I remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original, "It's Alive". The only thing about babies (mutated or not) that scares me is having to change their diapers...it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too! What a worthless...waste 
In my review of 'It's Alive' I noted that that film was surprisingly serious and low-key for a film about murderous mutant babies. The same cannot be said for these two movies. However, they're highly entertaining, so between the 3 of them we get a bit of everything. This is some very entertaining schlock horror right here. Can't imagine why it isn't more popular. 'It Lives Again' is the better of the two here, and probably the best of the series. This is a direct sequel, as the killer baby epidemic is spreading and the government has resorted to immediate execution. Frank Davis is back with a number of sympathetic doctors and scientists, and is working to save the children. This time there are 3 babies, and there is a whole lot more baby mayhem. Though they're still occasionally conspicously absent from the frame, you see a whole lot more of the kids this time around. Obviously, they are rarely at all convincing but I think they look neat and seeing the babies maul someone is always a treat. There's still quite a bit of downtime, but Frank is still entertaining to watch, so it doesn't hurt it all too much. He's getting pretty obsessive and nutty by now, but I still sympathize with him. This time around the whole thing seems a lot wackier. Now they've got whole legions of cops waiting for the babies, and watching them search the hillside and lengthily discuss baby-hunting strategy is just very amusing. The film is hurt by the fact that the ending is a bit to reiterative of the original. Seems a little lazy this way, but it doesn't matter too much. Grade: B 'Island of the Alive' is easily the weakest of the series, but it's still entertaining and deserves some credit for trying something new. It starts Michael Moriarty as Jarvis, an actor who fathers a mutant child, and fights to have them saved. After a hilarious and awesome courtroom scene involving a stop-motion animated baby it is decided that the killer babies will be banished to some jungle island. The film focuses on a few years later where there is an expedition to see how the babies have grown. This points to the central problem-- The babies are all grown up throughout the climax of the film, so they're basically just monster people. That is much less appealing. Still, there's quite a bit of baby action at the beginning, and it's the best stuff of the series. There's a sequence where a pack of hired guns go out to wipe out the babies shortly after they're placed on the island which is absolutley priceless, culmnating in the final survivor fleeing in the helicopter only to find that, dear God!, there's a baby already inside which leaps on him from behind. Also, then the helicopter explodes, for no apparent reason. As with all the Cohen monster films I've seen this movie has got a lotta talking, focusing largely on Moriarty's wacky, twitchy and crazy performance. I find him fairly amusing, but he's definitely on display too much. The film is also helped by a fair bit of gore, but the overall relative absence of the babies reduces the charm of the film substantially. Grade: C+ Yeah, this disc is definitely worth at least a rental. At this low of a price I'm sure I'll pick it up sooner or later, actually, but ya certainly oughta see it at least once 
It's ALive 3: Island of the Alive is down right hilarious. Nothing is better than watching mutant babies grow up and eat people. I mean seriously. My personal favorite scene was the court room scene with the "baby" in the cage. Good laughs. In this flick, Michael Moriarity portrays a father of a mutant "baby." The government decides to put the lil' suckers (theres five or so now) on an uncharted island. Five years later, they decide they need to get "fluid samples" off the creatures for scientific research. Michael Moriarity goes along for the ride. Well the "babies" have grown into five year old "adults." And one of them has had a baby of their own. Yes indeed, Moriarity is a Pappy. All is well until they all die. Except Moriarity. The monsters want to get back to civilization and Moriarity gets stuck with the job of taking them there. Somewhere along the journey, they chuck him out into the ocean, Cuba picks him up, he gets back to the states, bla bla bla. All in all, this is a funny movie that deserves a four star rating on a B-movie scale. Watching this movie alone is like getting beat to death by golf clubs, but watching it with a bunch of B-movie lovers is a riot. If you liked "Island of the Alive" I recomend: the awesomely bad movie "Creature," it's sci-fi on drugs and totally funny. What I learned from Island of the Alive: Cuban officers are nice AND funny 
They're cute! They're cuddly! They'll rip yer head off! In IT'S ALIVE, the Davis baby ran (crawled) amok, leaving bodies strewn in it's frenzied wake! Larry Cohen's saga of babies gone bad continues with this double dose of pernicious pablum! IT LIVES AGAIN has Frank Davis (John P. Ryan) crashing a baby shower to deliver the bad news that the expectant parents (Frederic Forrest and Kathleen Lloyd) are about to hear the pitter-patter of little murderous-mutant feet! If that's not horrid enough, the government is watching and waiting for it's chance to swoop in and make things even worse! Mr. Mallory (John "horses-head-in-the-bed" Marley), leads a team of operatives bent on mutant infanticide. Frank must get the young couple into hiding at a secret facility before the inevitible bloodbath. Check out the delivery-room on wheels! Slower than the original, but good enough for repeat viewings. ISLAND OF THE ALIVE opens with the infamous taxi-cab delivery scene. Then, we shift to a father named Stephen Jarvis (Michael "Q-The Winged Serpent" Moriarty) fighting in court for the life of his caged son. The judge decides to spare the creature, and an island is found where it and others of it's kind can live in peace. Well, of course, invaders arrive to hunt down and kill the babies, only to become so much baby food themselves! Finally, another team is sent to "study" the lil' devils, who have all grown up into big ol' cannibals! Mmmm! It turns out that the "kids" have a plan of their own! Karen Black (Trilogy Of Terror, Burnt Offerings) stars as Jarvis' ex-wife, Ellen; who just wants to forget the whole "killer baby" thing. I love this one! Much gorier than the first two. This is a great double feature! Grab the first one too and complete the trifecta... 
When watching the third X Men movie, one cannot help but wonder if Bryan Singer was involved in the movie.Brett Ratner does a credible job on his contribution to a movie franchise that Singer defined. The movie is loaded with great action sequences,new characters,plot twists and and resolutions.Unfortunately at 105 minutes it crams in too much when an over two hour screen time would better service under developed elements(The Phoenix,and the off-screen death of a beloved X-Men)and characters(Angel,Beast,Juggernaught,Rogue). The endings leaves the door open for this not to be the "Last" stand of the cinimatic adventure of the X-Men 
The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it 
In "X-Men III The Last Stand" the government has found a 'cure' for mutants, and are more than happy to help make them normal humans. Of course Mutants from both sides of the fence do not like the idea of becoming cured, many do not see it as a disease. Of course Magneto (Ian McKellen)dose not like this idea and raises an army or rouge mutants to fight the government program. Meanwhile Jane Grey (Famke Janssen) is back, though as psychotic Phoenix. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) tries to help, but is unable to reach her; and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has less luck, and a tougher decision. Many loose ends are tied up, and things conclude, so I am inclined to think this may be the last X-Men movie (though spin offs are more than likely). This film had a darker edge to it due to it's near Nazi-like idea of what the 'normal' people are curing. The action was really wild and great, you'll never be bored, that's for sure. And it also gets you at the gut too, as a few loved ones depart. The acting is about what you'd expect, good for a huge CGI driven spectacle movie. While Wolverine is still the focus the cast is so large that he slightly gets pushed to the side often with new characters like Beast, Jurganaught, and Angel, just to name a few. I like this film a lot, it was a lot better than the other comic book movie this summer, that's for sure 
Xmen III is one of the best movies ever!! The intense battle between the different philosophies of Xavier and Magneto is at its peak in the last Xmen movie The Last Stand, a tale of survival. This movie emcompasses all genres such as politics, action, romance, comedy, drama, horror, etc...this movie has something for everyone! From the politics of the Cure, to the forced suppression of the Dark Pheonix of Jean Grey, the internal conflict between right and wrong surfaces throughout this thought-provoking movie. Not only is the storyline beautifully philosophical, the actors and actresses express their emotions with perfect intensity. With the perfect combination of story telling and presentation, one can understand both perspectives, whether it is for Xavier or Magneto. This movie is nothing but perfect. 
The third installment of the very successful mutant franchise ends with a very loud bang! Filled with more action and special effects that you could ever hope for... no to mention all the mutants they could cram in 2 hours. This was a very good movie, if you can set aside the fact that it has no plot whatsoever. XMen hardcore fans may be disappointed of the complete alteration of the Phoenix Saga... and of the complete moron the Juggernaut is turned into. The good: Many incredible fights and battles. Beast rules! The bad: Not a very interesting or profound plot. Juggernaut sucks! 
A cure has been discovered to help mutants be normal if they chose it, unfortunately it has made Magneto (Ian Mckellen) furious as hell as he recruits some of his deadly mutants to put a stop to it. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) whom thought she was left for dead in the previous picture has been resurrected but filled with dark powers as the powerful and evil Dark Phoenix as she joins up with Magneto to enslave humanity once and for all, but can Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) along with the X-Men (Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, James Marsden) with three new members Kitty Pryd (Ellen Page), Beast (Kelsey Grammer) and Angel (Ben Foster) stop the war from happening? This is the final installment of the popular "X-Men" trilogy, the film is kind of weak compared to the awesome first two installments. But there is plenty of good action sequences, some humor, more wolverine action, emotion, and new mutants like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) as the director of "Rush Hour" Brett Ratner takes over Bryan Singer's spot for director to take this final installment to a new direction. It's a weak but very good end to a great Marvel comic movie series until a few character spin-offs come along like "Wolverine" and "Magneto". This DVD has great picture sound with some good extras like two audio commentaries and deleted scenes. It's still worth owning if you loved the first two movies or comic based movies 
If you enjoyed the old Martha Stewart Living program then you will be happy to add this DVD to your repertoire. It offers many different dishes and cuisines as you can tell from other reviews and it is fantastic to be able to relive these classic Martha moments. 
Martha, Martha, Martha!!! Well done, our good friend!! This time, she has invited some of the most well-known and powerful chefs to join her and share their kitchen gems!! Of course I would have loved for this to have been longer and with more video and recipes and such, but how can I possibly complain? It has the markings of Martha quality and perfection that is her trademark and she has once again, delivered some of the very best. Only this time, she has shared the spotlight with some of the cooking greats! There are 15 recipes that compromise 5 major cuisines, which include American, Italian, French, Mexican, and Asian. And she has some of the top chefs within each joyful international fare to teach us, with the assist of Martha's reputation of superb filming quality and perfection of delivery. AMERICAN: Oven-Roasted Ribs with Bobby Flay/ Olive-Stuffed Flank Steak with Tom Douglas/ New England Clam Chowder with Jasper White ITALIAN: Spaghetti alla Carbonara with Mario Batali/ Spiedini alla Romano with Lida Bastianich/ Lemon Chicken with Frank Pellegrino FRENCH: Cote de Boeuf with Daniel Boulud/ Shrimp with Orange Dust with Jean-George Vongerichten/ Coq au Vin with Riad Nasr MEXICAN: Tamales with Diana Kennedy/ Chiles Anchos Rellenos with Roberto Santibanez/ Calamari with Jose Hurtado ASIAN: Pad Thai with Su-Mei Yu/ Pork Buns with Eileen Yin-Fei Lo/ Hand Rolls with Nobu As per usual, there is the ability to print recipes and instructions for all of these classic foods. Trying to pick a favorite is very difficult because there is a time and occasion for each of these gastronomic delights and it would be very weak to cry ignorance in knowing how to prepare any of them. The joy (or shall we say the secret) of Martha's success lies in her knowledge that if you give all the steps and instructions to make something, be it food or crafts or gardening, the masses will return to you again and again. And we do. This DVD is no exception to her steadfast rule. We are very grateful for her step-by-step, detail-oriented teaching style and this has become her hallmark. She requires this of her guests as well. And when it comes to cooking and baking, it is essential; if you want a following, teach them well and with patience. I was please to see that she went back into some of her earlier shows to bring up this menu of guest chefs and recipes. To see a very young Bobby Flay and Mario Batali as well as the most elegant Lidia Bastianich. She has even more treasures from her earlier shows which I hope she brings to DVD as well, perhaps to buy as a series. Ah yes, I digress........... I was trying to decide which was my favorite but that became impossible as each recipe had some aspect of desire that made it difficlt to decide. The Clam Chowder was soooo very good but that is for my fall and winter settings; for summer, I rely on the Pad Thai with its slight kick of flavor to get us in the mood for sun and fun, not to mention the superb Shrimp with Orange Dust----------absolutely a must!!! And if you need something just a wee bit special for dinner, go with the Olive-Stuffed Flank Steak because it is as beautiful to serve as it is to eat. This is a definite Top Ten Martha----enjoy!! 
After the intensity of Zoo TV and the seeking of Pop Mart, the Elevation Tour was a big hug and a kiss from the boys from Ireland. This is U2 at their spiritual, musical and interactive heights. From the loving interaction between the band members to the obvious delight of the fans this DVD captures a magical experience. Each tour from U2 is a gift and this DVD is an excellent way to remember! The tour is captured well -- great footage and sound. Thanks U2 for providing your fans with so much material to enjoy when you're not around. 
U2 is one of only a handful,if any,band's that have been around for 25 years or more with all original members.And it shows,it's easy to forget that there are only three musicians onstage playing 95 percent of the show.The band comes onstage while the house lights are still on and procede to go into their first number "Elevation" while they stay on until halfway through the song.Many great songs fill the hall all through the dvd.Superb sound and picture will please any viewer,only when the "Bono -Cam" angle is pictured does it become slightly blurry."In a Little While" is performed to perfection,so is "Bad" and many others.Notably missing is "One",probably U2's greatest song ever put to sound,so is "Pride(In the Name of Love)" and a few others.It is still a very solid performance by four of the greatest Irish rockers to ever walk the earth.The second dvd is pure bonus features,music videos and alternate camera angles on certain songs from the first dvd,easter eggs are also included in both dvd's(good luck!).This collection belongs in every U2 fan's library,it could very well even bring a tear to your eyes.Enjoy this brilliant concert from Bono and the gang.. 
This DVD is a complete rip off, the performance is more focussed on Bonos sunglasses, with a camera in his sun glasses of all things, keep it simple and exciting, that means proper editing. Its oviuous this editor should'nt be editing any shows what so ever and needs lessons as to how to tell a story to an audience. We are not at the show, so stop trying to create an atmosphere, of swishing shots, because the atmosphere for the viewers is the flaming living room, and your job is to bring something into the room, not try and pull you in, with disasterous effects - what? A great big switch of OFF on the remote and a $13 dollar cash in at the second hand store. Thnak you very much - for Nothing 
Great DVD. Really enjoyed it! Especially the Sunday Bloody Sunday song. Go check it out 
Well, my gosh, what a waste of time, U2 really should give it up and just go away and stop plagaraising everything with their marketing money making schemes (u2.com members, ticket prices.) I won't go on and on about U2 being sold out, where it all went wrong, all I know is that U2 are getting by and panicked when Popmart was'nt well recieved, mainly because they were silly enough not to finish the record and get a tour booked ahead of it. So the DVD... boring whats wrong with it 1. Crap editing, as others have mentioned 2. The band look bored 3. Bono looks like fat Elvis 4. Bono can't sing anymore 5. Was it really neccesary to have a camera in Bonos sunglasses? 6. Extras??? Two thirty second clips of Zoo TV and Popmart both of which they have'nt released on DVD and both of which are impossible to buy as VHS is extinct now. (Despite being their best live shows supporting two of their greatest albums.) 7. The credits are listed as a extra feature. 8. Plagued by material from the overated overhyped and boring album "All that you can't leave behind". ....has its moments, but at the end of the day its the performance that counts, not the lighting effects and the fancy but pointless and annoying unwatchable!! camera editing. If you want to have a collection of U2 live before they turned crap and commercialised add "Rattle and Hum" "Actung Baby" "Zoo TV live from Sydney" and "Popmart" VHS's to your collection, thats if you can dig them up from anywhere. U2 have yet to release a decent DVD, dissapoiting for the biggest band on earth 
This is a great DVD. We really enjoy U2 and have found this to be one of their better DVDs. I think you'll enjoy it 
Be sure to catch the Alternate views on Disk 2. The view from the control booth with the director losing his mind, in a good way, is great. They also have A Beautiful Day from the rooftop in Boston 
I never stopped being a U2 fan. However, I did not like the direction that band was going during the Popmart tour. I had enough of U2 dressing up like the village people and coming out of giant lemons. Pop was a decent album with some good songs. They followed it up with Zooropa which had to be their worst album. I understand that U2 was trying some type of sarcasm with the Popmart tour. They went away from what they do best. Great rock music and electric concerts. I wanted to see the best live ROCK band in the world again. U2 finally got it right again and released "All That You Can't Leave Behind". It was a collection of great lyrics and beautiful melodies. This DVD is the concert tour of this album and it's a good one. As the pamphlet inside the DVD case, the previous 2 concerts were "huge public arts spectacles". This concert was about what a great singer Bono is, what an awesome guitar player the Edge is. This was more about their performance and connection with the crowd than it was about giant screen Televisions and Lemons. This is a great concert. It starts with a great performance of Elevation that will have you jumping up and down. They follow it up with Beautiful Day which was done brilliantly. You then hear the familiar beginnings of Until the End of the World as the strobe lights start flashing. Bono walks along the heart shaped walkway shaking people's hands. This is vintage U2. The crowd is really into it. Another highlight of the concert is their classic anthem Sunday Bloody Sunday. You become glued to the screen when you hear the beginning of Bad. Bono sounds great. The band is completely on. Towards the end of Bad, Bono slips part of "40" in. The music stops and the crowd is singing 40. Bono and the crowd continue to chant back and forth. As this is going on, we hear the familiar begining of Where the Streets Have No Name. This is the highlight of the concert. As the lights start flashing and the Edges guitars begin to rev up, Bono starts running around the heart shaped-walkway attached to the stage which extends into the crowd. He runs faster and faster around the stage until the crowd goes into a frenzy and Bono starts singing. You could barely hear Bono singing because the crowd is singing along so loud with him. This version of the song may be the best live performance of any song that I have ever seen. Truly incredible performance. Another highlight was With or Without You. Bono pulls a girl from the audience as he is singing. They lay down flat on their backs with Bono holding her as he is singing. You could see the girl's lips synchronized with Bono's, singing along the familiar words of the song. I'm sure it was a thrill for her. It shows Bono's showmanship. He knows how to command an audience. Great guitarwork by the Edge on this one. Larry and Adam are solid as always. This DVD is excellent. However, it does have one flaw. The constant shift in camera angles was very distracting. I do not like the director's (Hamish Hamilton) MTV style editing. This concert was a great one but if you really want to capture the true U2 experience, "U2 go Home- Live from Slane Castle" is a better choice. The Slane DVD captures the raw emotion that one feels when going to a U2 concert; the transformation from being a spectator to an active participant of the U2 experience. The Boston DVD does have the feeling of a U2 concert but is a little more staged. However, it is a must have for any DVD collection. If you're a U2 fan, it is even more of a must have. This DVD truly deserves the highest rating 
Cars is an excellent Pixar movie. It's a car version of Thomas The Tank Engine with storyline references to Doc Hollywood, but it's easily the 2nd best Pixar movie topping Finding Nemo. The DVD has great special features such as an epilogue and the Inspiration of Cars. I enjoy the animated short films One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight. The folks at Pixar have done it again brining in a great story, great characters, plenty of eye-popping computer animated effects. I especially am into vehicles 
I collect all the "Pixar" movies. This one is exceptional 
my son does too. we have been watching it again and again and again for the last 3 days, and neither has gotten tired of it yet. why we love it? cause of the way cars are made into persons by means of graphics (the expressions and "faces" thay have and make) and acting. cause of the story - it's warm and fuzzy and funny :) cause of the way story is paced; it never gets boring and slow, but it doesn't kill you with the tempo either. cause its beautifully done (not to say "drawn, cause we know it isn't just drawing any more) - the characters, the details on them, the city, racetrack, nature.. one of my all-time favorites. 
I tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released. Not up to normal/past Pixar standards. I say it is most like A Bugs Life. A good but not great film. Music did nothing for me. Where was the normal stand out musical score? Standard extras, BUT no Making Of section. I would have liked to have seen that. SOMETHING I HATE ABOUT SOME DVD PACKAGES. THOSE HORRIBLE FLIP DOWN OPENERS. YUCK!!!!!! Kids will enjoy. Nascar fans will enjoy. Fun but forgettable after you watch it. 
I'm a language teacher and I have a number of DVDs that I use at school as language tools. DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English. Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD. I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I suppose it's my fault for assuming, but I feel ripped off just the same 
This is a great pixar movie. This is my personal favorite pixar film. It is extremely good graphics. The director went on tracks to see how the track would look, and asked real nascar narraters to do the narrating for the race scenes. The plot is very good. Its about a car named Lightning MC Queen. His life was racing, and he was rude to people. Then he gets... Well you better find the rest out yourself. The jokes are funny, and the cast is so good. This is a great movie for every one. The bonus features are good to. Theres the bloopers but without the credits, and then the inspiration for cars. The sneak peaks are not to good though. There is 5.1 sound and there scene selections are good. There is allot so you can find where you left off. I cant wait untill the 2 disc special edition comes out! This is good movie for everyone from 5 to as old as you get. So I recommend this movie cars. You will have a long road ahead of you! 
This is simply the cutest animated feature I have seen in years. The characters are superb. The art is fantastic. The humor will catch young and old alike, and I do mean young AND old. This is one cartoon that will be appreciated by those in their retirement years. Actually, some of the puns will go right over the heads of the younger crowd. The film had me laughing as much as I have laughed at anything for a l o n g time. Then, just when I thought it was over, a short follow up came after the credits. Then, just when I thought THAT was over, I discovered a couple of shorter animated bonus features and began laughing all over again. I could find no faults. I only have two suggestions: 1. Buy a copy for yourself 2. Buy a copy as a gift for that special someone. 
According to me - CARS is the best the PIXAR studio has made. Toy Story was the first, The Incredibles were action-packed, but the CARS ARE JUST SIMPLY THE BEST! I like the story, I like the superb soundtrack and of course I love the animation. It just made me feel that even cars have soul and feelings... Well maybe it wasnt a feeling but now I really believe that all the cars have feelings 
Cars is one of those movies that only Pixar would dare to undertake. Whereas many of Pixar's past successes have been copied by other studios, Cars is a concept that stands alone. The attention to detail in Cars, in everything from the motion of the vehicles to the breathtaking settings and animation, is simply astounding. When Pixar decides to create a movie, they do it right. They do their research and it pays off. With Cars, Pixar has created a world populated solely by vehicles; a world in which machines not only have faces-- but have real heart and soul. Pixar's mechanical world is fleshed out enough to suspend disbelief without insulting or eliminating the need for the audience's imagination. The concept of anthropomorphic cars without humans may not sit perfectly in a logical sense, but that's okay-- Much of the movie's unique charm would have been lost with the inclusion of humans. The world of Cars is an alternate interpretation of our own-- it's a "what if?" world. After all, we spend so much time in our vehicles that to someone looking in from the outside, it might appear as though the vehicles were the actual beings inhabiting the Earth rather than the humans within them. Somehow, Cars makes surprising sense... perhaps in some ways even moreso than the world that we do live in. Every scene in Cars advances the movie's purpose and the development of each character, and every voice-- even every spoken line-- does the same. Cars is simply really touching. There are plenty of laughs throughout, but the real charm of the movie is its heart. Cars isn't about cheap comedy; it's a movie that makes you genuinely smile if you let it. The characters are diverse and surprisingly realistic, and the character interaction is unparalleled. The message of the movie is not subtle or terribly complex, but it's real. The story isn't anything completely revolutionary, but it's incredibly well polished and superbly executed-- without being overly predictable. Cars is one of the few movies I've ever felt the desire to watch multiple times just to fully experience all of the detail and heart infused into every scene. To be honest, I'm not a big car guy (I probably wouldn't know an automotive joke if it hit me in the face), I've never cared a lick about racing, and I don't have any emotional ties or great interest in the history of the midwest... yet I absolutely love this movie. If nothing else, I think that says a lot. As for the DVD itself, I'm hoping for a 2-disk set in the near future, as this release is sadly lacking in the bonus feature department 
Imagine Bergman with a touch of Hitchcock or Chabrol. In this award-winning film about a father and two young sons on a fishing trip after twelve years of separation, there is the bleakness and moral ambiguity of Bergman's world, where people live isolated lives, often on remote islands. Meanwhile, there's the creepy uncertainty that permeates the works of the masters of suspense. In its stark focus on three characters traveling alone together, it's also reminiscent of Polanski's early film, "Knife in the Water." Visually the film is striking with its slow but persistent camera movement and the washed out color that reduces some scenes to monochrome. Meanwhile, the soundtrack music is spare and eerie. Most striking of all are the performances, as the taciturn and vaguely malevolent father interacts in unexpected ways with the two boys, who regard him with varying degrees of trust and distrust. At some level, it's a film about fathers and sons and the distance between them as the immaturity, emotions, fears and physical weakness of boys are confronted by the uncompromising expectations of hardened adult males, who have shed any vestige of their own boyhoods as something to be scorned. And we keep watching the man for signs of his true character as he responds to the two boys, one of them willing to accept the man at his word, the other deeply suspicious and openly rebellious. Based on a simple premise, it's a brilliantly conceived story that holds the viewer to the end, leaving us finally with unanswered questions that provoke reflection on the loss of innocence and the uneasy relationship between family and self. The DVD includes a one-hour making-of documentary that reveals many of the challenges of directing and shooting the film. Not least interesting is its commentary on working with the film's young actors 
I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie. I have seen plenty of Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component. Mikhalkov, for example, is a director who can do this. This movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting, and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson. although the acting isn't necessarily bad, you don't get attached to the characters. I got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot. At times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching, even though i never do that. Anyway, I do not recommend this movie. IF you want to watch some good russian movies, go with "Brother", "Burnt By The Sun", "Prisoner of THe Mountains", "War", or "Unfinished Piece for the Mechanical Piano 
Some reviewers stated that "The Return" was filmed in Siberia. Actually the lake where the main events take place is the Lake Ladoga (the largest lake in Europe), which lies North of St.Petersburg. As far as my take on "The Return", it's one of the most haunting and moving films I've ever seen 
What if you hadn't seen your father in twelve years, and one day you came home, and your mom said that he was sleeping in the bedrooom? That's exactly what happens to the two young brothers, Andrey and Ivan, when the mysterious man, just arrived, who claims to be their father, decides to take them on a fishing trip for bonding time. As the movie progresses, it is evident to both the movie viewer and the brothers that something isn't quite right. Every once in a while, the father turns around and just seems to do something absolutely strange, from a violent outburst causing his motives to be questioned to moments of a possible attempt at actually spending time with his sons.  Both of the brothers experience separate reactions. The older one trusts his father, while the younger is reluctant, which often causes strife between them. Haunting, disturbing, and in some ways sad, The Return, is more of a slow and thoughtful film to be appreciated for its subtleties. Each part is acted quite well. The characters are believable and made real through the their hardships and obvious uncertainties. I think the thing that makes The Return such a special movie is the relationship between each separate person and seeing how they treat one another. It's fun trying to figure out whether or not the father really is good or bad; although, a warning beforehand, a few things are left for you to form your own opinion about. Perhaps that is what the director wanted, and it doesn't harm the film, might even make the ending more effective and powerful; so keep an open mind and don't be disappointed. This isn't like American movies where every loose end has to be tied up at the close, however messy or unbelievable 
While I very much admired it, let me say up-front that people with short attention spans will not enjoy the Russian film THE RETURN (a.k.a. VOZVRASHCHENIYE). It has a simple storyline, spare dialogue, and long takes. Watching it, one senses allegorical intentions of an almost Biblical proportion after a while. Which is another way of saying that this is an art film. (Albeit a gorgeously filmed and affecting one.) I was very sad to learn that the young man who plays the older brother Andrey (Vladimir Garin) died in a boating accident not long after THE RETURN was completed. This is odd and poignant; as Andrey, he spends a lot of time in a small rowboat. And he was a compelling actor whose face is a fascinating canvas of stubbornness, humor, and hope. (His brother, Ivan Dobronravov also gives a bravura performance.) As to the film, with its mythic aspirations, it could easily have fallen flat. But it doesn't; instead, director Andrey Zvyagintsev's ambitions are realized through the believable acting, gorgeous cinematography, and intentionally open-ended storyline. THE RETURN is not the kind of movie that you love, but you sure do think about it after the credits roll 
One of the best movies I have seen in a long time 
Some of the diaries of the German troops heading east to the attack on Russia seem to elicit not so much a fear of the Russian Army as being thunderstruck by the vastness of Russia. The immensity of the country comes across in this purely Russian movie about two boys reunited with their father after a hiatus of 12 years. Since the boys, Ivan and Andrei, are so young, they have no independant memory of him and are forced to run to a secret hiding place where they have ferreted away a photograph of him. Both nod affirmatively: 'It's him.' One of our weaknesses as Americans, whether we travel to foreign countries or read foreign books or see foreign movies, is that we expect to see the USA in a foreign tongue. When we don't, we criticise the effort because in our minds, it doesn't measure up. 'It just ain't normal, Gladys!' So one thing this film isn't is that it isn't American. We don't know what the father was up to. We don't know why he came back. Millions and millions of sons and daughters grew up in that sad, anonymous, fungible childhood that was eastern europe after Communism. And in some families men returned and in some, other men returned. There wasn't any "Leave it to Beaver" and there weren't any "Waltons." Beautifully filmed we see the boys taken on a painful and lengthy journey and in a manner of speaking, the journey represents their passage from adolescence to something else, not adulthood but something just before that. It's beautiful and worth the effort. But it ain't Rocky. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury 
This is not a film of Realism, but one of symbolic significance that perhaps only an acute observer of Russian culture would understand (Russian or non)--not to say that you could not watch the film and think that it is about abandonment, societal coldness, or irrational revenge, which it is on the surface. But if you go on here writing a bad review because perhaps you rented it for $3 on Netflix and it ruined your evening then I would suggest that you stick with The Stroll ( Progulka ) or something equally engaging that gives you a taste for modern Russia. Brave directors take chances, and that is why they are the best, but sometimes at the expense of a mainstream audience. Most people on this side of the world are much too spoiled and naive to be able to grasp the horrors of having your world and everything you believe in turned upside down again and again and again until you have nothing to hold but the earth itself. No one blames you for that, and I really have no idea why you would buy this movie anyway, unless you simply love the beautiful cinematography. Sometimes movies do fail to make a point, but this is not one of them in my view. Basically, if you buy this film without watching it first then you are asking for trouble. Trust no one and make up your own mind by renting it first. Do not form presumptions because you like foreign movies or because you are a Tarkovsky fan. I would say that Tarkovsky is an influence on Zvyagintsev, but Zvyagintsev has his own ideas of what a film should do. Modern Russia, free Russia, is full of surprises. This is not a digital camera, you know. You have the unique opportunity to try it first before you buy. Amazon reviews are at you disposal. Make your decision. Rent it and then buy it...or do not. Why discourage others who have not had the chance to view it themselves? Do not give into Big brother. We are a democracy and we are strong. Think and evolve. 
The abandon of the familiar nucleus by the father has been told so many times in too many places. In Latin America is a very common place, the wide gamut of feelings this fact may arouse are so many and so randomly that hardly can be expressed or resumed but through little testimonials. This chamber work deals with this painful issue. A father decades to return to his family, after twelve years, his wife does not doubt to forgive him, almost instantaneously, but Ivan possesses a very difficult character, he won' t forgive him with such easiness. The father doesn't transmit his feelings, sunk in his own world and trying to get some affection, he invites his sons to fish. This journey will be the big frame in which the complex dramatis personae will unfold. A crude and incisive glimpse around one of the most sorrowful and common portraits in any latitude of this world. The visual language is superb. This young director conquered the admiration of great audiences around the world. The film awarded several important Prizes. It is magnificent in all orders. A little gem of this promising and gifted filmmaker.. Do not miss his name. 
This is a truly great movie that is wasted on American audiences that are accustomed to the shallow themes, a truly beautiful movie for those who are deep and sensitive. I did not find it slow for it has great depth and almost hypnotic quality. It held my attention throughout and this is very hard to do. I got lost in the movie but of course those who like cheap thrills and are shallow could never appreciate it 
I agree with most of the other reviewers regarding MOM OF MANY MUNCHKINS review. She was way too critical! For hating the dvd so much, she has it memorized. She is correct about the "uh" sound, but my son has started talking so much since we got this dvd from our local library. He has even started saying complete sentances! Brainy Baby may not be perfect, but they are obviously doing something right. He also watches it from beginning to end without getting bored, and even giggles when the babies giggle. It is very cute! I think they did a great job. We have to remember that this video was made for babies and toddlers, not grown up adults 
This review was very difficult for me to write as I have mixed feelings toward the video. As a first grade teacher, I am very critical of anything that requires the very particular and accurate use of phonemic awareness. Unfortunately, as the mom in the last review pointed out, this video has many inconsistencies when the narrator and little girl say their letter sounds. First of all, when saying letter sounds, one NEVER wants to add the sound -uh after any letter!! For example, when saying the sound for "T" we don't say "TUH", we simply whisper it by dropping our tougue from the roof to the bottom of our mouth. Or, we say "W" not by saying "WUH" but by forming the W with our lips, then holding the W sound like wwwwww. Though most of the sounds in this video are correct, they occasionally slip into the "-uh" trap! How on earth are our children supposed to read if they add -uh to every consonant....tell me....for instance, what the heck is puh-a-tuh! (translation without the -uh and you get the word "pat"!) Now, looking beyond the inconsistencies in pronounciation, I have to say that my 2 year old son LOVES the video!!! I am completely in awe and amazed that within one time of watching it, he repeats EVERY letter as it drops onto the screen. Though I find it terribly repetitive and boring, he is COMPLETELY engrossed!! And you know, HE IS the one who is supposed to love the video (not me!) so I suppose Brainy Baby has hit the mark on that aspect! He sits through the seven minute introduction and is totally aware as each written letter comes on. He enjoys the kids and babies on the screen and it doesn't seem to bother him that there is no real "action" or fun puppets like they have in the Baby Einstein videos. So, as a mother, I am overjoyed that he is enjoying the video, learning his letters AND gaining a nice vocabulary. He is slightly speech delayed, so anything that will help to improve his language awareness is a blessing. So how do I rate this?? As a teacher, probably no more than a 3. As a mother, I'd have to give this a 5 since my own child is rapidly developing his language awareness just by watching a simple DVD! I haven't watched any other letters video, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them! 
Believe it!... This is a great video. Brainy Baby just seems to really know how to connect with children when it comes to teaching. The lady who gave this a one star and wrote a book about her feelings, is a bit over the top and has way too much time on her hands. We also homeschool our children and found that this video really helped them when they were younger to learn the alphabet. Remember, this is a PRESCHOOL video! Your children are being introduced to learning situations, not studying for a college exam! We have found that all the Brainy Baby videos are top quality and do an excellent job of teaching. Our boys knew the entire upper /lower case and all the letter sounds around 16-18 months! It was amazing and I KNOW that these videos played a big part in that. I am also impressed that all of their videos have a very specific educational outline that all my teacher friends say is excellent for teaching preschoolers. After doing a little research, I found a little known fact that it was Brainy Baby that created the first set of "infant-preschool" videos over 10 years ago (way before the Einstein series). So, that really gave me confidence that the producers at Brainy Baby really had the experience and track record. My advice, I don't see how you could go wrong for a mere $15 investment in your child's future. I own all of them and wish Brainy Baby would make more! 
This video is amazing! After 1 week of viewing this video, twice a day (once in the morning and once after nap time) my 18 month old daughter could sing the alphabet song AND recognize BOTH upper case and lower case letters. If you are determined to give your child the best head start and realize that education begins at home, you will run out and purchase this video for your child now. I only wish I had picked it up for her when she was 6 months old. I will purchase this video as a baby shower gift before a Baby Einstein video (and we love our Einsteins) ~eDe 
I purchased this DVD for my son at Christmas. He was 26 months old and has autism. Up to this point, he only could say a couple of words. He had shown interest in the alphabet, though. When I first watched the DVD with him, I thought it was really dry and boring, and he hardly watched any of it. BUT...then we played it a few more times and he started to show a lot of interest. Soon he was saying many of the letters, and within a week knew the whole alphabet. Two months later he is saying 25 words, and I think it all started with learning the alphabet! Although I still don't think it is a very exciting video, and yes...some of the letters are not pronounced correctly...it has done a world of good for my son! 
Thank you Brainy Baby for this video! I looked all over to find a quality video in order to introduce and reinforce the ABC's to my 17 month old. I began introducing the alphabet to her at age 6 months, and she now knows the letters by name and can "sing" the ABC song. I bought this to help reinforce her knowledge because I like that it starts out by singing the traditional ABC song several times, and then it goes into presenting each letter. I also like that it shows real life images of children and other objects, and its not just a bunch of fanciful images set to classical music. At the end, they sing the ABC song one final time. I think this a great buy for teaching ABCs, its simple and its exactly how most people would teach it. 
I just can't say enough good things about the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys. I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old. He loves them. And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen. :) As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile. He is captivated. I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos. And the toys.......he LOVES them. "Hello, Brainy Baby!" They are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box. I have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time. We love Brainy Baby at our house. 
I am a speech pathologist and was surpised by another review that complained about the repetition in this video. That is how children learn -- by repetition!! Remember, this series is designed for the cognitive and learning skills of the 2-4 year old set, not an adult! I have a 3.5 year old who barely sits still, yet the children and action in this video keep his attention. Yes, there are instrumental and singing portions, but that is what kids love. I have several in this series and my kids love them all. Both my kids learned their ABC's by watching this video (along with practicing with foam letters in the bathtub). I find the Brainy Baby series to be much more educational than the Baby Einstein videos. For those of you who feel your children have advanced beyond the Baby Einstein videos, I would highly recommend this series. Great for the preschool age group 
My 20 month old son loves this DVD. He has taken a real liking to the alphabet song and stays glued to the TV whenever this DVD is on. He also recognizes the objects associated with each letter and likes to point out or sign (according to the ASL signs he's familiar with) the objects that he knows. Good product 
i received my cd tape and was very excited to watch it with my son. the first time was ok however, the 2nd time it skipped. i cannot watch the entire tape b/c of this. i had thrown out the receipt so i could not return it. jennifer neuma 
Sometimes I watch a movie and it turns out to be far more entertaining than I thought it would be. Such is the case with CELLULAR. I had seen the ads for the film and even though it starred Kim Bassinger, I thought that the movie wasn't going to be entertaining at all. My brother had seen the movie when it came out in theatres and had enjoyed it immensely; he as especially intrigued by the "average citizen becoming a hero" angle. When I borrowed the movie from him to watch, I tried my best to put my predispositions aside and suspended my disbelief. I surprisingly found myself becoming immersed in an action-packed and suspenseful story. CELLULAR takes places in the showy and flashy wealthy environment of Southern California. Jessica Martin (Kim Bassinger) is a high school science teacher who lives with her realtor husband and son in the L.A. suburb of Brentwood. After dropping her son off at school, Jessica's home is invaded by a gang of thugs, her housekeeper is shot, and she is kidnapped and taken hostage. The kidnappers want something her husband has and she has no idea what it is. The criminals lock her in the attic and smash the building's only phone as they plan to later kidnap both her son and her husband. Jessica must teach at a private high school because she is able to scrounge together the parts and revive them into a working telephone. She is only able to call blindly and reaches a self-absorbed, young, and immature kid named Ryan (Chris Evans) who is cruising down Venice Beach on an errand for his ex-girl friend in an attempt to win her back. At first Ryan thinks the call is a joke, but he soon becomes convinced and attempts to help Jessica as best he can. Thus begins a lengthy adventure of car chases, attempted killings, more kidnappings, uncaring salespeople, a carjacking, people playing their car stereos too loud, and crooked cops for Ryan all while trying to maintain a constant conversation with Jessica via his cell phone. The basic concept of CELLULAR seems incredulous at first. However, it works rather well. Cell phones have become ubiquitous in our modern society (except I don't have one yet) and as far fetched as some of the events in movie seem at first, the more one thinks about the situation the more credible the idea becomes. The film's writer, Larry Cohen, also wrote the movie PHONE BOOTH. This movie tackles some of the same issues that were touched upon in that film, but fleshes them out a bit. Should Cohen decide to write another movie about communication devices it could very well be a sensation. Perhaps another reason that CELLULAR works so well is because of the acting. Even if you have no desire to see the movie because of the concept, see the film because of Kim Bassinger and William H. Macy, who plays a good cop named Mooney who is preparing to retire from the force. Bassinger is lovely to watch and her portrayal of a kidnapped mother is convincing. Macy brings a lot of humanity and humor to a character that could have been rather dry and dull in the hands of a lesser actor. Chris Evans also does a decent job and seems to mature as an actor as his character matures as a person on screen. Some of that might be because Evans ended up doing almost all of his own stunts in the film. Overall, I really enjoyed watching CELLULAR. It's not necessarily a great movie, but it is a good action/suspense/thriller that isn't a waster of one's time. The DVD includes three documentaries, an audio commentary, and a trailer. I found the documentaries informative and engaging. One, "Calling Out" is on the history of telephones and how cellular phones have and are continuing to change society. "Dialing Up Cellular" is about the making of the film. "Code of Silence: Inside the Rampart Scandal" is about a 1999 LAPD corruption scandal. I hadn't heard of this case before and I found it quite interesting, especially how the writer was able to incorporate some of these events as a plotline for the film 
This is one of my favorite movies in recent years. In the film, Jessica (Kim Basinger) is kidnapped and manages to click the wires on a smashed phone to place a call. She reaches beach slacker Ryan (Chris Evans) and manages to convince him that she's telling the truth and to get help. What ensues is a mad rush through downtown Los Angeles as Ryan tries desperately to assist her. The DVD has some good features on it (interviews, scene selection, etc.), and the movie overall was well made. If you are into this sort of movie, I recommend it. You will not be disappointed in the least bit 
Cellular is a sleeper hit. A long overdue example of a real edge-of-your-seat thriller that is well-written and well-acted. Great driving and action scenes are complemented by humor. The story is about a carefree California youth who becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving dirty LA cops and a kidnapped family. Kim Basinger turns in a great performance as the wife and mother fighting for her life against Ethan, the leader of the corrupt cops. Played by Jason Statham (The Transporter), Ethan is a competent bad guy. My husband and I loved this movie. It has the wake-up equivalent of black coffee 
While not on the level of "The Interpreter" in terms of plot depth and character development, "Cellular" delivers what it says it will: a fast paced, tense thriller that will please most people. The plot is complex enough to keep the watcher guessing what exactly will happen and not bore the audience. There are a number of tense scenes that add to the overall suspense and thrill of the movie. If you're in the mood for a fast paced thriller this will not disapoint you. 
I saw this on cable, and was skeptical, because the premise of the movie sounded kind of dumb. It revolved around a cellular phone. However, it turned out to be a great movie. There were never any dull moments, and it was just fun to watch. I wouldn't mind owning a copy of it, if I could get a good deal on the price. 
The most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it? After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day? Mystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it 
Having visited St. Petersburg, Russia a year ago, I could not pass up the chance to watch this movie. I must say, it was nicely done. I can relate to the obnoxious, business like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip. I was more like the care-free younger brother, but not quite so care-free as the character protrayed. The scenery was awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although I wish there were more because the city is full of beauty. And this goes for the women as well!! I mainly went to see the city...but I also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that I planned would be my travel companion. What I didn't expect was to really fall in love :-). The BIG reason why I confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to American women...as if explained in the additional extras on the DVD...but the Russian lady that I met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly changed my way of thinking!! One thing I should add though. The movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself. Such is not the case. It takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at least 8 months, but it is more like a year. It is time consuming to get her a US visa. But she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover, the wait is worthwhile. Another word of caution: Prepare yourself to fall in love with Russia...the people are very nice and I know of a lot of Americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some even live there now 
My favorite movies are those with interesting characters and engrossing dialogue. This movie has both and was delightful and entertaining. 
I'll be honest. I only watched this movie because it has Emily Mortimer in it. The first time, anyway. The second, third, and fourth times were for the very simple reason that I loved the movie. Action lovers be warned: it moves at a VERY slow pace (although, for some reason, it never drags), and its appeal lies almost entirely in the performances of Tim Blake Nelson and Emily Mortimer. Maybe I should explain a bit. The film is about two brothers (shocking, isn't it?) whose late mother spoiled them beyond reason. They are incapable of fending for themselves, even to do laundry. Their home is such a disaster that they cannot even find a maid who is willing to work more than one day. Desperate, they finally reach the obvious (!?) conclusion. Wife! Using the actual international matchmaking agency A Foreign Affair, the older brother, Jake (Nelson) books tickets to Russia, where they hope to find a woman who will keep house in exchange for a green card. Once they reach St. Petersburg, though, the brothers find they are not the only ones interested in Russian brides. A documentary filmmaker (Mortimer) offers to translate for Jake as long as he allows her to follow him around with a camera in his face. Both brothers begin to learn a bit more about themselves, women, and the world at large. The movie was shot in an almost documentary style, including several interviews with real men who had actually gone to St. Petersburg to find wives. Seriously. But if this were a documentary, it would be the most hilarious one I ever watched. The movie is obviously not for everyone. If you like black comedy, this is the way to go, but if your taste runs more towards gags and obvious jokes, avoid it like the plague 
Terriffic Movie just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt 
This movie is wonderful. Although it didn't exactly make me cry, it did touch me in a sentimental way. I fell in love with Morrie. He is such a sweet guy, and his story is an inspiration to everyone. I was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life, even though fate had handed him a death sentence. He made up his mind that he wasn't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible, and I really admire that. I was also pleased with the effect Morrie had on his old college student, Mitch. Mitch learns to appreciate life's little surprises, and to not be in such a big rush all the time. He learns to relax and smell the roses, to let go of old grudges, to value the people in his life, and he even learns to allow himself to cry. My most favorite scene is where Mitch actually breaks down and bawls, and Morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other. This scene is without a doubt the most moving one in the entire film. Although it's the last time that Mitch ever sees Morrie alive, it's still very sweet and poignant. The ending is pretty sad, but it's also happy at the same time. Morrie is gone, yet his legacy lives on. I recommend this movie to anyone, of any gender, of any age. 
This movie was so very well done, and so very sad. It will reach-around from behind you and pleasure you in a way you didn't expect, but will leave you feeling very sad at the end. Sad, but inspired - and that is what this movie is about. Inspiration. Morrie was a great, stand-up character who was always "pitching a tent", so to speak. I highly recommend this movie 
This is an excellent story about what life is really all about. The book and DVD make excellent gifts too. I highly recommend both products! 
 The film exhibition as the act of dying can be lived with love and people that love each other enter, creating a protection atmosphere, of support, of peace. Morrie gives us a life lesson in the death 
I've seen this movie on TV a few years ago, but it just wouldn't leave my mind, so I ordered the DVD. It's one of those movies you won't forget, because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach', as Mitchell calls it. Morrie is a great coach, and if you watch this movie, you will see why it is so heartbreaking. An old, wise man, a long lost friend, who teaches the last course in his life. At home. One student. A must have seen 
Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry 
This movie makes you think about things we don't think about everyday.... life, death, and what's important. Defintiely an eye-opener... deep and emotional at times. 
I had read the book first befoe viewing the TV movie and to tell you the truthe i couldn't tell which came first: the chicken (movie) or the egg (book) Jack Lemon and the rest of the cast were suberb 
It took me all of 4 hours to read this book. It was insightful and entertaining. It was also sad. I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours. I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever 
Very good film with a great cast. Reese and Wahlberg are wonderful in their roles and play them to perfection, Walhberg especially. Very much worth watching/owning 
What a cast! Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William L. Petersen, Amy Brenneman and Alyssa Milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl (Witherspoon) and her seemingly perfect boyfriend (Wahlberg). Of course, the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker. Wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance. William Petersen (CSI) is outstanding as the Witherspoon's concerned father who has way too many issues himself. This film is a hidden gem. Buy it . . . you will not be disappointed 
ALyssa Milano is HOT , HOT , HOT. I like this movie, it is like a reverse teen version of Fatal Attraction. Made after The Crush and before SwimFan, fell right in between and much better film than both, much more suspenseful and better actors at that 
Was this crazy or what Mark did a very unbelievable job and he play that roll right down to the T..very scarey i haven't been in a releationship like that but for those who are i hope they get out of it ok. 
Even though this film might be categorized as a guilty pleasure, it still contains excellent early performances by Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and a maturing Alyssa Milano. Production value is high, so this is definitely not a B-movie. The well-developed plot is a familiar one - good girl meets great guy who ends up being a psycho. But the lack of originality doesn't take away from the interesting progression of the movie. Directing, editing, writing and acting are still top notch. And, even though Wahlberg's character ends up going off the deep end, he portrays a believable 'normal' guy in the beginning, even providing an intense roller coaster service early in the movie. He made a pretty good psycho, as well. I enjoyed the film and would even watch it again. 
This is hardly a new story, but it still effectively told under the grunge setting of the time and the somewhat hoaky lines that Mark Wahlberg says. (And that scene on the roller coaster, I don't care who you are it's not happening that way.) Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a sweet faced 16 year old freshly transported from Seattle to live with her father and step mother. Still somewhat neive and overly friendly with all she meets, she meets a handsome stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg). At first all seems well, as he wins over her parents and they are enjoying the bloom of new love. But David has a dark side, whose jealous nature emerges slowly but surely. Eventually he shows that he doesn't just have a dark side, but is outright dangerous. Lies about the past, violence, and the inevitable ending in a blaze of glory violence take place. This is a movie all girls should watch, it teaches us all about the bad boys. A part of us is drawn to the bad boy, whose dangerous and somewhat psychotic side appeals to girls. Why? Because we girls want to be bad ourselves and we are trying to live it through the bad boy. Reese Whiterspoon's friend played by Alyssa Milano is the more obvious example. She picks up the ugliest, greasiest man in the room, praces around in her hootchie mama outfits because he wants her to, and allows herself to be used and abused until it's too late. Fortunately for Reese, her sexuality is kept under under more modest wraps. Of course, we must learn these lessons by doing no matter what your friends, family or even the movies can tell you. Eventually we can see through these thin venirs and get past it. If you want to be a bad girl, be one on your own time. The bad boys of this world are lots of fun, most are tornados in the sack, but cheat left and right, wrap chairs around heads, and will call and ask for bail money. Sell crazy and codependent someplace else. 
This is a great movie and one of my favorites. I watched this movie back in 2002 and bought it a couple of months ago when I saw it at Wal-Mart. The acting is great-- Reese Witherspoon Mark Walhberg. Highly recommended. 
What makes such an impact here is that it's not that far fetched. My ex-brother-in-law was just like Mark Wahlbergs charactor. He was abusive and manipulitive and downright aggresive, overly protective/controling and jealous beyond no end. That to me is what makes this movie so scary (not really scary but intence)...it's very close to home and very real. This could happen, this does happen because there are people that are really like this. Mark Wahlberg plays the perfect psycho, all sweet on the outside but you can see through it. That was my brother-in-law. You almost wonder why they bother to pretend because it's so obvious you can see through the fasade. Too bad Reese couldn't (then again neither could me sister)...Teenage girls beware...just because he says nice things to you and you lost your virginity to him doesn't mean you should forgive him when he punches your friend in the face and tries to kill you family. Very well acted on all fronts with a tightly wound believable script. Recomended 
This movie is crazy good. Marky Mark plays such an excellent psycho and Reese Whitherspoon does a great job of playing the innocent/rebel teen. The suspense keeps building and building in this thriller for a dramatic ending. An excellent movie and an excellent movie to own 
This movie is great. I just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it. I throughly enjoyed it entirely, I believe it kind of relates to Fatal Attraction 
For my wife and I this was a return to the year when we were dating. This film was playing and we went to see it. She liked the soundtrack so much that I bought it for her as a gift. This was in 1961 or 1962. We enjoyed the movie then and enjoyed it more this time because of the memories. The fact that we are older and seem to understand a little more about the world also enhanced the experience. Buy it, you will like it 
Compelling movie in light of recent news. The birth of Israel in the late 40's is still the cause of much conflict in the middle east. I recommend that a individual watch this movie with his heart and not solely on it's performance by the actors. There was a way of making movies back then that is not seen today. No CGI in this,just location scenes. A very watchable movie 
Otto Preminger's EXODUS is a very well made film. This is a big film and director Preminger is a master at handling films of this scale. He is a master technician and he tells this story on that level rather than showing anything highly stylistic in nature. Well, that is Preminger's style, straighforward and technically proficient movie making. 
Otto Preminger's 1960 cinematic presentation of the founding of Israel, from an adaptation of Leon Uris's novel, is strictly old-school filmmaking. That is a good thing and the best way to approach this novel and subject. The methodical progression of the story concisely and dramatically interprets events and puts them into a historical perspective for future thought and discernment. Otto Preminger's singular purpose is to tell how Israel came into existence. He skirts political and moral issues with hackneyed characters and their simplistic points of view to get his story across. The overall effect of this film is moving enhanced with composer Ernest Gold's inspiring score and central theme. The cast is impressive and includes Paul Newman, Eva Marie Saint, Ralph Richardson, Sal Mineo, Hugh Griffith, Lee J. Cobb, John Derek, Peter Lawford, Marius Goring (good casting), David Opatoshu, Martin Benson and Jill Haworth. 
This is an excellent movie, but could have been even better. And as a previous reviewer noted, it would have made a great mini-series. Even at 3 ï¿½ hours the plot is very compressed. What took years to happen in real life seems like only months in the movie. I found myself looking up events on the Internet in order to keep track with what year it was in the movie. Some of the plot seems far fetched at first: Subjecting children to a hunger strike for example. And the prison break scene is right out of "Robin Hood." I was amazed, therefore, to learn these events really happened. The acting is wooden in places, but nevertheless you grow to care about the characters. The scenery and music are magnificent. The ending is a disappointment though. (Here comes a spoiler.) We never get to see the actual birth of Israel in May 1948. Instead the movie ends shortly before that with Paul Newman's character giving an idealistic speech about Arabs and Jews living in peace. The viewer is cheated out of seeing how Newman's character reconciles his idealism with the reality of the War for Independence. The movie is also quite poignant. It was made in 1960, and all the extras we see dancing around the kibbutz were real Israelis. It's sad to think that all those children and happy young people grew up to experience no end to war. Another irony is that Jewish terrorists play a prominent role in the film using bombs in an attempt to drive the British out of Palestine. 
It gets harder and harder to watch this movie, especially the young Paul Newman's final screed on the death of Karen (relax, Butch! Jill Haworth's only pretending to the dead!). As a document of the transition from Gandhi's hunger strike, intended to embarass the British into behaving decently, to the Irgun's ruthless bombing of the King David Hotel, intended to bloody the British into leaving Israel alone and unprotected in the exact middle of her traditional blood enemies (Arabs? what Arabs?), it's informative. The movie barely scratches the surface of hatreds that have festered in the Middle East for millenia, and the glossy Hollywood overcoat has peeled away from the history over the years, but as a faithful reflection of a naivete we Americans will have to overcome to have any hope of surviving nuclear armageddon on Ariel Sharon's cattle ranch, it's pretty good. In today's hip-hop world, Sal Mineo's deep dark secret that he was raped by Nazis in Dachau seems laughable -- these days, you can hear that kind of gangsta rap from the Toyota next to you at a red light. As a call to menschlichkeit in a harsh world, 4 stars 
Love this movie BUT the transfer was so pathetic that I returned it to the vendor. This DVD is absolutely the WORST transfer I have ever seen. MGM goofed on this classic 
I saw this movie when I was 13 and thought is was good. Times and relations were different with Israel then. Today the movie still has such relevance even though our relation with Israel is quite different. It is a classic and one of the best from this era. 
This is the WORST transfer of a movie (that is not a tape-to-tape before DVD bootleg) that I have ever seen. Many scenes in the daylight show a jiggling reflected lights, or so it appears, and lines dance around with the sound. It was so bad I thought it was in individual damaged DVD, until I read other reviews here and on IMDB. This is far worse than most cheapie transfers that are no longer owned but are in the public domain. At least in those instances they usually have the excuse that the print they are working from is old and worn. I have a much better video of Exodus on VHS tape in EP! And this movie is currently being offered at Amazon for $14.95. Don't bother! Tape it off TCM and you'll have a far higher quality visual record. As for the movie itself, despite good actors and one of the most wonderful music scores, it's very flat. Kirk Douglas would have been a far better choice than Newman, who acts like he just came off a binge after a losing pool streak. Nonetheless, it should not be sold with in lousy visual copies 
I loved What the Bleep, but this was very disappointing. There was no new information, it was basically a very boring repeat of everything that she said in What the Bleep. We know the vague concepts already, we are looking for specific information for practical application. That is what this video is advertised as providing; unfortunately, it offers none at all. It just felt like an cheap effort to make another buck on the What the Bleep hype. Watch What the Bleep, it's amazing. Pass on this one, it's a waste of time and money 
I loved What The Bleep? And I specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day'. This video teaches NOTHING about how to create your day - NOTHING. It's just Ramtha (JZ Knight) talking about the fact that you can create your day. I HEARD YOU IN THE MOVIE! I bought this to give me some additional insights into HOW to create my day. It does NOT teach any HOW whatsoever. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO! Buy "The Secret" @ TheSecret.tv. Buy "The Attractor Factor" by Joe Vitale. Buy "Wealth Beyond Reason" by Bob Doyle. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO 
Hmmmm.... infomercials now seen as documentaries? If you are in need of hope then I guess you'll believe anything. Harry Potter was so much better than this .... guess JK Rowling has a much better imagination than JZ Knight. Post-September 7 review given all the hoopla over What the Bleep - Quite frankly: Did the people rendered homeless by the Tsunami create that? Did the students injured at the recent shooting at Dawson College in Montreal (Canada) create that? Or even still ... did the people who were on the New Zealand airplane that crashed in fall 2006 in the Pacific create that as well? Sometimes others impose their wills on innocent bystanders through brutal force and that is not creating your day. That is just plain tragic. We are not victims of life but neither are we masters of the universe either. 
I unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same time.. this was the best of them.. the others were pure wastes of money. While this one didnt answer many questions and ramtha takes forever to make a point. if you've seen "what the bleep" dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds. 
Wow! Practice a few vapid platitudes and wield some handy aphorisms and woo-woo sounding phrases, change your voice, and you, too, can be a CHANNELER! For money! I'm definitely in the wrong occupation. Has anybody ever thought to question "Ramtha" on a few specifics that a 35,000 year old being from "Atlantis" should know? Did Ramtha's ancient society speak Indian-accented English? What an amazing stroke of luck! What did Ramtha's people do for agriculture and diet, how was his/her society structured, what tools did they use, and where was "Atlantis" precisely located? I'm certain that archaelogists and anthropologists could benefit from such knowledge that such a wise being could impart after miraculously surviving 35 millenia--or how many years precisely, and in what reckoning? Could Ramtha show us some writing samples in Atlantean script? Linguists could help here. Or--is it just possible that JZ Knight and her kind are great at pulling one over on us because we WANT and NEED to believe? Isn't that a more realistic explanation? What does that say about those who buy into this? 
What would you do on a given day if you knew that you had the power to make it as you wish? Watch this DVD and learn of your power to not only create your day but to create a day that is incredible. Do you know someone who is a victim, who thinks that their life is what has been dished out to them? If so, do them a favor and give this as a gift. Change your life and the lives of others. Highly recommended 
As a Student of the Ramtha School of Enlightement,and after hearing about the ??What The Bleep??Movie and editorials,I thought at fist this was a rather very Simplistic View of how Quantum Mechanics and Neurological Principles relates to the Science of Creating Your Day. But then again after purchasing the DVD and hearing it several times and actually practicing it teachings a few times;is when I began to actually see the Magic of THis Teaching. You see,the problem we have as humans beings;is that we have developed what is called a ??personality identification??lets call this Personality ID(PID).Now since we first came to this plane of existance;this material world we know as our reality;since the first moment we have being constantly recieving and storing information in our ??neuronet or what Ramtha calls the Yellow Brain??.Information that has come from the environment around us(Parents,relatives,friends,extrangers,etc),together with information feedback from our own experiences with(People,places,things,times,events).All of this interaction of Information that has come to us and how we have ??responded to it??throughout the years has created a ??Pattern of Response that is very Particular to each of Us??. This particular way of stimulus-response pattern mechanism has created some ??neurological pattern conections in our neurocortex brain??;it is like a computer program and it is what we call ??Our Personality??. The ??Science of How To Create Your Day??,teaches a simple method of how we can ??DISCONNECT FROM THE PROGRAM OF OUR PERSONALITY?? if we wnat to CHANGE something in our ??PROGAMED PERSONALITY?? that we dont like! Maybe we want to gain some weigth,or the other way around;maybe we want to act in a different way,maybe we want to be more agressive with people at work,or maybe we want to be a calm person and not be so aggresive,we want to change depreession,we want to stop drinkin too much liquor;maybe we want to be a nicer person to our couple.But whatever it is WE WANT TO CHANGE,its SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT BEING ABLE TO DO BECAUSE WE ARE STILL CONNETCED(WIRED)TO THE OLD PROGRAM OF OUR PERSONALITY! So in ??Creating Your Day??the Master Teacher send us a very simple yet profound technique on how to DISCONECT FROM THE OLD WIRING OF THE PERSONLITY;and create a ??New Reality in Our Brain??that will make possible the things we want to change in our lives! You want to change your life:??Change the Way You THink??,But in order to do so you must first of all learn how to ??Disconetc for the Old Program of Your personality??. THis beautifull simple teaching tell you how you can do it! May you become the person you really want to be 
I was SO disappointed with this DVD. Oh my goodness, it just rambled on for me and wasn't to the point. I loved the film "What The Bleep?" and was looking for more. I've just read "Ask and It Is Given" and am in the middle of the follow up book " The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent" both by Esther Jerry Hicks (Abraham-Hicks). I was abit reluctant to go down the road of "channels". Abraham-Hicks have got my attention, they're written with grace. I personally don't recommend this particular Ramtha DVD, perhaps there are others by Ramtha that are more engaging.. 
I purchased this DVD and it was scratched to hell. It will not play without continuously skipping 
When I first saw this movie I really didn't know what to think. Its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real, and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for "enjoyment." That being said, I love this movie, and here's why. 1. It's a true story. 2. It is extremely patriotic--even if it's patriotism displayed by the "wrong" country. How can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country? This was well-produced in my opinion, and I feel the only flaw was Harrison Ford playing a Russian. If you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing, but I appreciate this film very much for the values it displays 
It's 1961; the USSR has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the East coast of the United States for the purpose of...brinksmanship? But hold on, there is a problem; the Soviet Union is staffed with incompetents!!(one of communism's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel). The menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go. It leaks, and it is cobbled together with substandard parts. After heading out to sea, there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits. The men receive lethal doses of radiation, but unfortunately the doctor doesn't know anything about radiation sickness...he is only giving them aspirin. Before long radiation begins to permeate the ship. The entire crew is in danger. The officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the Americans, while others want to save face for the Soviet Union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die. As the submarine becomes more and more disabled, as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking, as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby American destroyer, as the submarines's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat, the dread of the crew is really palpable. This movie was very suspenseful because I had no idea how it would end. Definitely worth your time 
IN A NUTSHELL: UNDERRATED - UNDERVALUED - UNDEREXPOSED - Excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event! It is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the box-office. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are ideally suited as Soviet naval Captains, and as believable as their rebuilt authentic K-19! Kathryn Bigelow who Directed and Produced the film did an incredible job, which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the DVD. BOTTOM LINE: THIS NEW KIND OF SUB FILM IS A PART OF HISTORY If you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best. If you enjoy thrillers, this film delivers enough edge-of-your-seat tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the submarine-movie and thriller-enthusiast in anyone. 
For those who don't know russian the title of this was (Просмотрение K-19 - Review of K-19, thought I'd be funny there) This movie is not so much a combat movie it's a what happened movie. The flagship of the Russian Navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 Captians, yea that kinda don't go over so well. They have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys. It is quite a gripping movie though. This is also one that needs to be bought not just rented 
This was a true story and a scary part of our history. The book comes to life in the movie... I pictured another person as the captain of the Sub... Mr. Ford did a good job acting the part 
I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like "The Hunt for Red October" or "Crimson Tide" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice 
There are so much information about this movie in Amazon.com description and other reviews so I don't want to repeat them. The only problem in this movie was Harisson Ford's style, he was acting more American than Russian and for moments you may feel that K-19 is an American submarine and Harisson Ford is an American Captain. He was trying to act like an staborn phenomenon but despite of all of his efforts, he couldn't deny his American Friquent Style! I think Harrison Ford for this movie was not a wise Decision. I know, starring First class actor like him could guarantee the best selling of this movie and no one can blame the studio for trying to make more money but me myself really dissapointed of such flaw in this astonishing movie 
K-19 The Widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961, when a Soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense. Ford portrays the overly harsh commander and Neeson the captain in touch with the men. Probably the best submarine movie there is, especially when compared to the ridiculous "Crimson Tide" and "U-571". The cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown. 
For those that love Barbara Cook's splendid vocal ability, and the music of Sondhim, this is a real treat. This is as close as one can get without being at a live concert 
I've never seen Barbara Cook live, but have always been a big fan. This DVD is indeed fantastic, but I was slightly disappointed. On the cover, there is a picture of her in a sparkly top simply glowing in the spotlight. This picture is obviously NOT from the performance on the DVD. In this DVD performance, she's wearing some sort of pantsuit outfit and the whole atmosphere is much more casual than I thought it was going to be. From the glamorous picture on the jacket, I thought this was going to be an all-out BIG show (orchestra, etc.). Instead, it is a very intimate show with just piano accompaniment. Not that it is bad - on the contrary... it is a wonderful performace. It is simply different than I'd expected. Nonetheless, I still love it and recommend it highly 
Barbara Cook is a phenomenon. This DVD is so wonderful it is simply hard to describe. Of course, her performance is first rate but what really makes this disc a cut above is the master class available in the bonus features. How fascinating to get into the mind of a show business genius! And just by the shots of the crowd, it is obvious that all are totally mesmorized by the experience. She takes the kids from being talented to being stars right before your very eyes. I cannot recommend this any higher. Go Barbara 
The Hughes Brothers created a nightmarish vision of Victorian London only matched by some of Dickens novels. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are fabulous as the police inspector investigating the case and a prostitute who is a friend to the victims. The film is beautifully shot and the atmosphere of the grimy southside of London is captured incredibly well. The murder scenes are very graphic and this is definitely not for the squeemish or the very young. Depp plays a role similar to the one he played in Sleepy Hollow but this is a much more serious movie aimed at a different audience. My kids loved Sleepy Hollow but I wouldn't let them watch this. It would give them nightmares for a week. The plot is interesting and while fictional it has enough plausibilty to engage the viewer for it's entire length. Johnny Depp is an incredible talent. After seeing him in this,Pirates, Slepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands I have to conclude that this guy is the best actor of his generation. He is always interesting to watch. 
"From Hell" is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a horror movie. Although the story about who Jack the Ripper is is a little contrived at times, in general the plot is interesting. All the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you'd expect, considering the subject-matter. It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful. Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American. This film is great entertainment and I would highly recommend buying the DVD (if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway, it's that good). "From Hell" makes a great addition to any movie collection. 
A refreshing look at the ripper with a good insight into the secret societies. Depp as usual plays a very good part. A great movie 
If you follow my reviews, you know that I felt the version of "Jack the Ripper" with Michael Caine as Inspector Fred Abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece. Not only was Michael Caine phenomenal in the role, but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we don't know and never will. While I respect this version with Johnny Depp, it is more horror oriented. (Michael Caine's version was more historical.) Onto the subject at hand. Some of you may know Jack's 5 victims. (Mary Anne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Kathy Eadows, and Mary Jane Kelly.) Well, they seem to have a close friendship, and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret. (In the Michael Caine version, the 5 victims knew each other, but they were just associates.) Well, of course Jack the Ripper comes into play. One scene is very well done in that while we don't see his face, we do see some disturbing pictures, and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine. In comes Depp (Inspector Fred Abberline). It is interesting that while the older Michael Caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role, Johnny Depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday. But maybe Depp didn't want to just imitate Caine. One thing I had a problem with was that while Caine had some trouble with his superiors, Depp's trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion. (Without giving the story away, his superiors must have known things that they didn't tell Depp! At least Caine's superiors carried some reason on their side!) You'll probably notice that Depp finds things out much quicker than Caine did. (Probably because Caine's version was 4 hours, while Depp's is only 2.) While Caine was involved with an artist, Depp becomes involved with Mary Jane Kelly. Gradually, Depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle. Like Caine did in his version, Depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer. (OF COURSE, DEPP DOES NOT KNOW HE IS TALKING TO THE KILLER.) Well, another problem here is that in the Caine version, we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with Caine. We never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to Depp. (Jack the Ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the Caine version.) I will admit that the scenery is well done, the elements of horror are there, and Depp did a good job of not just imitating Michael Caine. And Depp's sergeant Godley does offer some entertainment. But if you saw the Michael Caine version, you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy. If on the other hand, you don't mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history, you'll probably find it a respectable horror movie. SIDE NOTE: Johnny Depp makes Inspector Fred Abberline look like he's going to die anyday. Well, in reality, Fred Abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped Jack the Ripper. 
From Hell: I don't think I can give a very good review of this movie because it is based on actual events, and the case was never solved, and I'm not familiar with the facts that do exist about it. All I can say is that given what I know, which is extremely limited, I think this is a good portrayal of what may have been. Of course, I think Johnny Depp was awesome in his role of the inspector in charge of the case. But then again, I love him; so... I'm not normally a fan of movies that take us back so far in time, but this one didn't bother me. I guess that is probably because of the subject matter. It's one of those instances where plot overrules setting/time period. That doesn't happen very often for me, so I'm impressed with that alone. So I guess for me, that about sums up my review. I'm sure it's not very helpful, unless you can use the information about Johnny Depp, and the info about historical films. If so, I'm glad I could be of service! 
What can I say about (Mr. Johnny Depp)? He's a gorgeous, smart, talented actor! He melts my heart! He's one of a kind actor! That's what I love about him! Plus, that he's totally hot! 
As usual, a riveting performance fromone of my favorites. Highly recommended for Depp fans 
It was recieved earlier than expected and in perfect condition. I was very satisfied with my purchase 
I liked David Cross more when he was the violinist for King Crimson in the 1970's. His comedy pales in comparison to his progressive rock credentials. Hopefully, David will call up Robert Fripp and get it together with Crimson again.. 
I think David Cross is a brilliant comic - even more amazing is that each show (Shut up you..., pride is back, etc.) is different material, not the same jokes again and again. I would love to see a DVD of one or more of these standup shows. However, this DVD is purely a documentary following Cross around to po-dunk clubs where people heckle him. I don't want a documentary about how crappy being on the road doing comedy is - bring on the jokes - give us a DVD with his full standup routines! Please 
I love David Cross's comedy, I love his stand up, I love Mr. Show. But this dvd is not kinda boring, it is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. There may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd -- there is no accounting for taste. But 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released 
this movie was kinda boring. Not enough of Cross' standup. Also when there was footage of his stand up, it wasnt that funny 
I don't understand why there are so many mixed reviews on this DVD. I guess the people that gave this DVD a poor review don't understand David Cross' sense of humor. I bought this DVD on a whim (since it was a low price) well aware that it was not a concert DVD. It is, in fact, a tour-diary filmed by Lance Bangs (of Jackass fame). I thought this DVD was well worth my $13, and it's one of those I can watch again and again. I wouldn't recomend buying this DVD unless you REALLY understand Mr. Show and David Cross' humor. If you're a die-hard fan of both, I guarantee you'll love this 
Don't get me wrong--like a lot of you looking over this DVD, I like David Cross's stand-up comedy a lot and I've always enjoyed Mr. Show, too. I think this documentary disappointed me so much because I found its overall effect neither very entertaining nor engaging (things I like about some behind-the-scenes documentaries), but instead rather formless and mean spirited. While we do get a candid look at the exhausting realities of life on the road on a tour (I admit Cross does run into some impossible crowds and pain in the a** people), so much of this DVD seems designed to make other people--including *fans* of Cross--look stupid. For a comic who routinely (and hilariously) criticizes religious and political thinkers for their intolerance, Cross himself frequently comes across as a pretty intolerant and elitist guy. It's just odd to me that Cross would take his tour out of comedy clubs (a neat idea) and into rock clubs, then get irate when crowds behave like they're at a rock show. Director Lance Bangs had the opportunity to: (1) widen our understanding of what it's like to be on the road and (2) ask some interesting questions (how do you make people laugh? how do you deal with the exhaustion, the disappointments, of being a performer?). Instead he just delivers a documentary full of easy cheap shots and unenlightening minutiae. Bangs has done some good work in the past with musicians; I don't know what happened here. Save your time and money 
And I did, until I cried. David Cross has to be one of the bravest, funniest and-believe it or not-most eloquent comics performing today. I thought it was very original to do this kind of DVD, instead of just rehashing everything that was on 'Shut up You F*cking Baby'. Instead we get to see what it's like to be on tour with David, and get a glimpse of some of the colourful people that he gets to meet on a daily basis. The fans of Mr. Show should be pleased to know that Bob Odenkirk even makes an appearance, and says one of the funniest 'heckles' I've ever heard in my life. I honestly don't get some of the reviews for this DVD, especially since most of them are coming from David Cross/Mr. Show fans. If you see a review that contains the words "I had experienced David Cross through his part in Scary Movie 2", do yourself a favour and take that one with a grain of salt. My only complaint with the DVD is that David has yet to do a Canadian tour, so that we too can get in on the fun. 
No, not really, but I liked the sound of that title. This movie was recommended to me by my great friend Bobby Asslong, who's recommendations are usually quite odd, and contrived, but this time, he hit the mark right on! Jack Black and Steve Zahn are absolutely hilarious, and Jason Biggs plays the straight one, in the title role. I personally didn't think Jason did as good a job as he could have done, but that's just my opinion. I personally don't care for Jason's acting. The set-ups in this movie are priceless, and I actually really got turned on by Amanda Peet, when she was working to get un-handcuffed by the Steve Zahn character. Friggin awesome! Watching this movie reminds me of a very good friend of mine, named Ronald Freidman. He is actually more P WHIPPED than the Jason Biggs character in this movie! His wife, Jacquelina, rides him HARD and puts him away WET every singly day of the week, as she gambles away her savings at a nearby Indian Casino, 3 and 4 times per week. I actually saw her slap him with a lot of force at a recent party. What a lousy life she makes for him! I think my boy Bobby A and I should make a movie called: Saving Freidman! Hey, it could work! Two big thumbs WAY UP!!! MC White said: Check it out!! 
Whether it's watching network news or playin' "Pull My Finger," it doesn't take much to make me laugh. More importantly, hit me between the eyes with ribald, sophomoric humor--humor as meaningful as a clown reading Shakespeare--and I'm good to go. Don't give me Woody Allen; give me Cheech Chong and a box of pizza rolls. Which is why SAVING SILVERMAN floats my boat. This flick has a stupid story (a triumvirate of buds torn apart by the girlfriend from Hades, and the steps taken by the two friends on the outside looking in to bust up the romance), over-the-top antics, goofy shtick, and a healthy dose of cornball. But it's darn funny, and as unpretentious as a mongrel using a fire hydrant. This movie reminds me of the best way to ride a rollercoaster: just let go and have fun. Jason Biggs is okay as the nerdy and whipped friend who must be "saved" (probably not much of an acting stretch for him), yet Steve Zahn and Jack Black are superb as the two mentally-challenged buds doing the saving. These guys make a great comedic team; they ought to hook up again in another movie. But as good as Zahn and Black are, Amanda Peet steals the show as the straight-faced, ball-busting girlfriend who won't give up her man under any circumstances (and some circumstances in this film are considerable). As mentioned above, SAVING SILVERMAN doesn't garner any blueblood points, but it serves up blue collar humor in spades. --D. Mikels, Author, WALK-O 
This movie is hilarous!I like the part when someone was doing yoga naked.Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor,language,and thamatic material.Good for anyone 10 and up 
Saving Silverman is my favorite movie of all time. I'm a huge Neil Diamond fan, so this is probably biased, but I don't care. Jack Black and Steve Zahn are hilarious, and this movie is a must-see 
This is one of the best comedies ever made, someone else wrote it sucked and that sean william scott was a talented actor, which shows how much that guy knows. In conclusion, Comingtoyaaaahaaa 
Hilarious movie. This movie made me laugh alot. The part where they break into the house, and Jack Black goes into the kitchen and starts to eat, that cracked me up. Definately check this movie out, its really funny. Itll make you laugh alot. Some of its stupid funny, but most is just real funny stuff. Anytime you have Jack Black in a movie like this, you can expect it to be pretty funny, check this out 
Steve Zahn is one of my favorite comedic actors and is brilliant in this film teamed up with Jack Black. The Duo really steals the show from Biggs, who still is good in what i believe is his second movie. Neil Diamond makes a great cameo appearance that adds to the laugh factor. A must see. 
Saving Silverman is a laughing riot from start to end. After many years, have I seen such an amazing film with amazing performances. Jack Black stands out as the best guy in the film. He can't make you stop laughing. Steve Zahn gives an amazing performance as well. This laugh riot is a great entertainer for the entire family and a great pick for frineds. A must see and a must buy. Go for it. Trust me, you will laugh your bones out !! 
We rented this movie not expecting too much. We like this genre (moron movies). Unlike several eggheads who reviewed this movie, we had no trouble at all following the plot. We just thought this movie was a scream! Lots of idiotic action and the girlfriend from hell. What's not to like? If you like this type of movie, you will love it! Mac McCaule 
I have always loved this movie, and was thrilled to find it on DVD at such a reasonable price 
It ain't rocket science. An A list star, some recognizable character actors, a hot blonde with great legs, snappy dialogue, a wonderful sense of location and just enough violence and action to keep the thing moving. Dennis Quaid plays a generally decent cop Ellen Barkin plays an uptight Internal Affairs agent. Of course they hate each other at first but then fall in love and become a crime solving duo. Neither Barkin nor Quaid are the stars they used to be, so The Big easy isn't watched much anymore. Thats too bad because this is one of the more intelligent and enjoyable action-comedy-romances from the 80's 
Buy it now, folks! You won't see New Orleans like this again for a long, long time. The Big Easy captures the city's lush and dramatic atmosphere, the performances are excellent, and the cinematography is beautiful 
As many reviewers note, New Orleans police drama "The Big Easy" exudes Cajun charm and Big Easy atmosphere enough to make you taste the Oyster Po'Boys and Chicory Coffee! But the fabulous capture of local ambience is not in and of itself what makes this opus a tip-top choice for every DVD library. Big Easy is a fine police drama/romance/morality play in and of itself. Dennis Quaid is a sexy young police Lieutenant named Remy McSwain. he's been a good guy but the toll of little gratuities and favors is adding up. Can he redeem himself to help equally sexy Assistant DA Ellen Barkin solve a police corruption case. A top-notch supporting cast includes Ned Beatty, John Goodman and the absolutely magnificent little role for Charles Ludlam as attorney Lamar Parmentel. Remy oozes oleaginous charm as part of a huge family of cops and firemen. That, his gator obsession (note the props and decor carefully!) just fit so well with the catchy Xydeco soundtrack. Don't miss this film. An overlooked classic of the 80's! 
This colorful and fast moving film from director Jim McBride about an only slightly corrupt cop in the "Big Easy" and the pretty Assistant District Attorney sent to investigate the department is filled with cajun spice and atmosphere. The lines between right and wrong are blurred like a rainy windshield in this lightning paced and very sexy cop film. Dennis Quaid gives a terrific performance as Remy McSwain, a second generation cop who sold out early on in his career, accepting it as the norm but not letting it hinder him from doing his job. When the prim but sexy Ellen Barkin arrives on the scene in the form of D.A. Anne Osborne, he attempts to wine and dine his way out of trouble as the bodies start piling up in an apparent drug war. The charged encounters between Remy and the shy Anne blend seamlessly with some very brutal crime scenes and a lot of New Orleans' music to propel this film at a breezy and very enjoyable pace. When Remy's own corruption is exposed, their relationship becomes more complicated when he tampers with evidence and gets off. But her comment to him that he is no longer one of the 'good guys' causes him to take a serious look at himself. When cops are discovered to be behind all the recent drug trouble, the answers will hit far too close to home. A very unique cop thriller that manages to maintain a light and breezy ambiance throughout, this is one of the most memorable films of its kind. Its spicy flavor goes down easy and makes you crave more. A supporting cast that includes Ned Beatty, John Goodman, and Lisa Jane Persky, offer fine support in this very seductive and one of a kind film you must see. Pick this one up today 
If you like the Big easy as much as I do, then I think this a good way to renew contact with the Crescent City 
This film is a drama in the classic sense of the word: it begins in order and ends in disorder. And it occurs against the backdrop of N'awlins - the Big Easy. You can almost hear the nightly raindrops spattering on the greasy sidewalks. Dennis Quaid is a good cop walking the fine line between integrity and corruption - playing at the edges. Too cute by half. His winning, seductive, boyish smile and easy charm make him a perfect foil for the career minded, straight-laced Assistant District Attorney (Ellen Barkin). But the truth is elusive in New orleans. Things aren't always what they seem and somewhere along the line, choices will be made. Big choices. In the Big Easy. Someone's likely to pay the price. A Big Price. The film starts out light and breezy but quickly turns dark and sinister when the plot thickens and danger strikes too close to home. The leads are engaging and winning. The plot is predictable but engaging. And the mood is dark, like New Orleans herself, at night, in the rain, spattering on the greasy sidewalk... 
A true classic and a definite original for its time. Starring such movie icons as Dennis Quaid, Ellen Barkin, and Ned Beaty, this is the type of movie anyone could enjoy. The Big Easy follows the life of easy-going Lieutenant Remy McSwaine (Quaid) of the New Orleans police department homicide division as he investigates what appears to be an impending gang war starting with a series of murders on some of the most ruthless gangsters in New Orleans. However, straight-laced Assistant District Attorney Ann Osborn (Barkin) sees things differently as she inserts herself into the investigation, looking at police corruption being the cause. But when they put aside their differences they feel a growing attraction to one another, one that allows them to put aside their differences a few times. Despite their growing relationship, Ann doesn't ease up on trying to uncover the truth about the murders. Remy feels the same way, but he can't see why a cop would do all this. However, his idea of police corruption is different from how the District Attorney and Internal Affairs see it as they catch him accepting a bribe. What makes it harder for Remy is that he knows it's illegal, but he and many others on such a take consider it a side benefit to being a cop. But it's this incident that damages his relationship with Ann almost permanently and it takes many revelations on the murders to bring them back together again. This movie is very detailed in portraying the deeds of the New Orleans Police Department that corrupted it for so long. It also works to make Remy and Ann's relationship believable. The mix of a cop with poor judgment and a coy lawyer creates great sparks and it comes off realistic. Both Quaid and Barkin have excellent chemistry and definitely display the best of their acting ability. Barkin works well to show Ann struggling with her feelings. You can see she really cares about Remy but his hand in the corruption weighs heavily upon her mind. And Quaid falls almost naturally into Remy's role, shining his bright smile and showing how much he cares for Ann and for his family as well. This is a definite must for fans of crime drama, but it's like a mix of genres. It's the type of movie for everyone. Don't bother renting it, it's better bought 
Set in New Orleans, Dennis Quaid is a police detective mildly on the take; Ellen Barkin is an insider sent in to investigate the corruption. While she is being prim and proper and going by the book, Quaid becomes neck deep in a murder investigation. Quaid turns out to be small potatoes compared to who the killers are. Parts are fairly predictable, but on the whole it's not a bad movie 
Walt Disney Pictures struck gold yet again (as they've done since 1937, when Walt Disney released the comnpany's first animated feature film "Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs") with another delightful animated family film, a classic alongside "Beauty And The Beast," "The Lion King," "Toy Story" and many other Disney favorites. The story is timeless, like "Beauty And The Beast" and "The Lion King" so I won't summarize it. "Come on down, stop on by. Hop a Carpet And Fly To Another Arabian Night." Be prepared to discover "A Diamond In The Rough." The special features (beginning on Disc 1 and continued on Disc 2), along with the movie, are "A treasure-trove of riches" destined to please everyone. The voice cast includes Linda Larkin, Scott W., Jonathan Freeman, Gilbert Gottfried and Robin Williams. I love this movie. Rated G 
by 1992 and aladdin's release disney was riding high with such hits as "the little mermaid" and "beauty and the beast." disney carried on it's trend with this fun filled adventure.aladdin was truely a great additiion to the disney cannon because of strenght and subtleties. the story is well delivered and blends action, and romance briliantly along with comic relief characters that never seem corny or out of place. that seemlessnes keeps this film from becoming too sereous or light hearted. the animation is strong yet again. by this point disney was beginning to experiment with computer animation and what it could do. that helped the film imensley. the film's animation style itself is highly stylized but it works perfectly here. the music ties it all together and is just as strong as in preveous disney films. all these increadable elements come together to form a solid entertaining film. it isn't disney greatest of their modern four hits, but it holds up nicely and is quite impressive. it is definately, definately worth owning. 
First it was The Little Mermaid, then it was Beauty and the Beast. Now it's Aladdin, another Alan Menken movie. Alan Menken, in my opinion, is a genius. The songs he writes are absolutely wonderfull. Aladdin is a story about a boy who finds a lamp and a genie who can make his dreams come true. I highly recommand this movie. It's full of adventure comedy and music. A great film. Buy it now 
I've known this movie for a long time, but, in fact, I haven't watched this movie before this 2-disc special edition was published. When one day I saw this DVD was on sale in a book shop, suddenly, I wanted to watch it. Then I borrowed a copy of VCD of this movie from a friend, and after I watched it, I decided to collect the special edition, because I wanted to know more about this wonderful movie. What attracted me much were the characters and the music. Why this movie always makes me laugh? It is because of the Genie I think. He is a lively, spirited and natural born humorous guy. He can change into many different things that are all comical. Aladdin and Princess Jasmine are my favorite characters. They're both very bright and inner-directed, a handsome boy and a pretty girl. The air around them is romantic and happy when they're together. Rajar is a cute character, sometimes I really wish that I could have a huge but kind and gentle tiger just like him as a pet. While I'm reviewing a movie, I always think much of its music. Needless to say, "A Whole New World" is very famous to everyone, and I think the pop version is more famous. But I love the version in the movie only, because it's more natural, and makes me feel that this song is very magical. To a real extent, loving Lea Salonga and Brad Kane's voices is the principal reason of loving this song. Lea Salonga's voice is so sweet and pure, and her voice can always be associated with Jasmine's image. "One Jump Ahead" is a good song, the tune is wonderful, the lyric is funny. 2 songs that the Genie sang are wonderful, especially "Friend Like Me", the tableaux of this song in the movie are funny and comical, it was so creative! The bonus features is the most important part in this 2-disc special edition. There are many video that were recorded in the making of "Aladdin". Included the character creation, music composing, story editing and so on. It makes the journey of "Aladdin" more attractive and more magical. And there are some music videos in the bonus features, and a new song "Proud of Our Boy", it's wonderful. Besides, some funny games are in the bonus features. The games are a little childish to me, but your children will love them I think. This movie is one of the most magical and wonderful Disney Classic, so its 2-disc special edition DVD us worth collecting 
Aladdin is total family entertainment. The music is awesome and clever- great voices wonderful to watch. Other classics not to forget about are: Mary Poppins My Fair Lady The Wizard of Oz Chitty Chitty Bang Band The first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The Sound of Music Oliver West Side Story Fiddler on the Roof Singing in the Rain The Wiz Little Mermaid Aladdin Beauty and the Beast Grease The King and I Oklahoma The Music Man South Pacific My Voice Students are always asking me for recommendations so I though I'd post it for all! We can't forget about these great musicals 
I watched this movie with my 4 year old daughter just tonight. It is supposed to be the story of Aladdin from the "Thousand and one nights" also known as "Arabian nights". The problem is that it deviates from the true story in many ways. For example there is no "ring" or its Genie in the movie at all. There are additions such as the monkey turned elephant as well. In fact there are so many other deviations that it would take me a whole day to mention. However to be fair, this is not unique to this movie. Most movies, Disney in particular tend to rewrite master pieces resulting in vastly modified stories. Now this modified story, is perfectly OK by itself and my daughter loved it. There are some clear attempts to make the story appealing to adults. But then it helps to have parents interested! The songs are good and kids love them. As for the politically correct change from the first Disney release i.e. replacing the arab stereotyping, it is not unique. Disney also replaced a particularly offensive (stereotyping of africans) part of Fantasia in their DVD offer. My feeling is that we could all do with less racism and if it means removing offensive scenes and language we should do so. Besides this movie was never the real story anyway and the "non-PC" part hardly contributed anything. After all the value of the movie is not in how many people it hurts. My advise is: If you want the real story, please read the book. On the whole, this is a great movie, just not the real story 
One of the better Disney Classics... maybe the second most entertaining after the Lion King. This is the best plotlines that Disney has come up with (after the Lion King. Overview: Aladdin is a poor street rat and the hero. He falls in love with Princess Jasmine. But evil Jafar is trying to become the sultan and the most powerful person in the world. Aladdin gets the geni and must try to get the girl, and defeat Jafar. Why it is Good Funny THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY!!!!! Geni is Robin Williams. Iago is Gilford Gottfried. These two are sooooooo hilarious!!!! I'm an Adult and after years since I first watched it is still hilarious. My 2 year old neice also laughed her head off. I think that it is one of the funniest disney movies. The comedy is perfect!!! Plotline and Drama This is an amazing plotline. It doesn't slow down. There is no part where the movie drags or you start to feel like the drama is just going on. It moves at a awesome pace where you just keep watching. The story is great. Its original. NOT DULL. SONGS The music is not as great as the lion king. But it doesn't take away from the story or slow it down. I mean there are no musical numbers that the story line stops and the characters start singing. The music helps drives the plots and is funny to. The better songs is the classic "A Whole New World" and "Prince Ali". ENTERTAINING my verdict THIS IS THE TOP ECHELON OF DISNEY MOVIE. IT TRULY IS A CLASSIC. IT IS ENTERTAINING FOR ADULTS AS WELL AS CHILDREN. ITS FUNNY. THE PLOT DOES NOT DRAG ON AND GET DULL. MUSIC DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE MOVIE. THIS IS AN AMAZING MOVIE!!!!! I LOVE IT!!! 
While Disney's early animated films were seen as masterpieces (Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan), there was a long time when Disney's animated features were met with mediocre box office receipts. After The Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, and Oliver and Company (I'm not saying they're bad, just poorly received in theaters), there was a Rennaissance or second coming of Disney films. Starting with The Little Mermaid and going on to Beauty and the Beast (which remains the only animated film to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and probably the only one ever due to the creation of the Best Animated Feature category), Aladdin came soon after. Telling the story of the poor young boy who found a genie and got three wishes, Aladdin is a first for most animated films, due to its inclusion of pop culture references (more on that later). Aladdin is a young thief living in the fictional Agrabah (the tale took place in medieval Baghdad, but due to the Gulf War, this detail was changed). He and his partner-in-crime Abu (who is a monkey) must steal in order to survive, but in doing so must avoid the royal guards who police the marketplace. One day, he runs into a woman who is about to lose her hand for stealing an apple and giving it to a young child who is starving. He saves her and takes her to his home to hide from the law. It turns out that the girl is really Jasmine, the daughter of the Sultan. She ran away from the palace in order to see what life outside the walls was really like. The Sultan needs to marry her off to a prince (the law dictates that she must marry a prince, and she must be married by a given birthday). She is taken back to the palace, and Aladdin is arrested for "kidnapping" the princess. Little do either of them know that Jafar, the Sutan's vizier, is plotting against the Sultan and hopes to get his hands on a lamp which houses a genie. He needs a "diamond in the rough" in order to enter the Cave of Wonders and retrieve the lamp, and when he learns that Aladdin is the boy he's looking for, he has the guards sieze him (which happened when he was with Jasmine). Though he tells Jasmine that Aladdin has been beheaded for his crimes, he later disguises himself as a prisoner and helps Aladdin get out of the cell. He brings Aladdin to the cave and tells him that, in exchange for the lamp, Aladdin will receive a reward beyond his wildest dreams. Though, due to Abu's greed, Aladdin and Abu get trapped in the cave along with the lamp and a magic flying carpet. Aladdin accidentally releases the Genie of the lamp, who promises him three wishes and a way out of the cave. This is where the pop culture references begin. The Genie (who is expertly voiced by Robin Williams) spouts off references, impressions, and jokes at a mile a minute (my favorite of which being a Jack Nicholson impression). He does Ed Sullivan, Pinnochio, Arnold Schwarzenneger, and numerous others. Anyway, from there, Aladdin wishes to become a prince so that he can marry Jasmine. Little does he know that Jasmine has no interest in marrying a prince, despite what the law dictates. At first, she is upset that yet another vapid prince has come to win her, but he eventually wins her over by taking her on a ride on his carpet across the world (it wins her too quickly to seem real, but it will have to work due to pacing issues). After that, she agrees to marry him. This leads Aladdin to reconsider his promise to free the Genie with his third wish, because he fears that he will need his services and help in the future. Meanwhile Jafar tries to find a way to get rid of Aladdin, and eventually he steals the lamp away, turning Agrabah into hell on Earth. While there may not have been any twists (it was fairly by-the-numbers), Aladdin is a very enjoyable movie. The animation is great (while not as revolutionary as it was back in 1992, it is still good), and the songs are some of Disney's best, especially A Whole New World. Furthermore, it can serve as an interesting study in freedom for older viewers. Being free and feelings of confinement/imprisonment was a major theme throughout the movie. And even if the older viewers don't like film analysis, there is still a lot there to enjoy. Aladdin is a great example of how a kids' movie can be for everyone (maybe not as good an example as The Incredibles). It is fun, funny, and very well done overall 
This is the absolute best documentary I have seen to date on political/financial corruption and the brainwashing of the public, with the help of the corporate-controlled and gutless media. This film is required viewing for the intelligent half of the population, as well as the less intelligent half that identifies with their leader (to quote writer Norman Mailer) 
...is other dimwits' idea how the world should be, no wonder it's getting worse. How can anybody believe someone who, having been sworn by the bible, deems his first duty is to fight those who have been sworn by the Coran (or any other superstitious literature), is beyond me. In the end, the only winner will be stupidity blinded by superstition. For a while american governments' politics were submitted only by rulings from United Fruits, Ford, or petrol moguls. Now Microsoft has also power to crush competition by blackmailing governments under the guile of unemployment (which is very untrue, since they got much more people losing jobs than those who might lose theirs in Redmont if Mr Gates was not above the laws). And now, America got a new crusader who wants to go back 10 centuries : just look at was is taking place in Texas, since they feel having support in obscurantist ruling : they now want to reenact the "Monkey Trial" in 1925, opposing sheer blind stupidity against open-mindedness examination. Even if he regards himself as the new "Burning Bush", and believes he's God's speaker, don't beat around the bush, just trash it, if you don't want the whole world burning!!! Straitjacket and cold showers should be adequate.. 
Although my Panasonic DVD recorder/player was unable to "read" this disc, thus viewed it om my computor (a minor inconvienience), I found this to be a serious and well-done documentary...one that we all should see and share with everyone we know. Where "Fahrenheight 9/11" was well-done for entertainment as well as information, this French film-maker created a documentary that delves more into the Bush Family history which is important to know in order to better understand where G.W. is coming from. 
This film is a caustic expos of the Bush administration and their machinations leading up to the invasion of Iraq. William Karel interviews numerous individuals from the CIA, advisors to the president and Hans Blix, the U.N. weapons inspector, revealing a calculated propaganda campaign to sway public opinion to support the Iraqi war. The WMD question is explored at some length and the fact that GWB, Vice President Cheney and Colin Powel knew full well that there was no connection between Saddam Hussein and al Quada, that there certainly was not enough evidence to prove that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, intentionally lying to the American people. What is telling, confirming the Bush administration lied about Saddam Hussein, is a comment made by the president in a cabinet meeting, a year after the invasion, stating he knew there was no connection between al Quada and the Iraqi regime. This, of course, begs the question, if this administration knew there was no connection between al Quada and Saddam Hussein, and there was no solid proof that this regime possessed weapons of mass destruction, why was the country invaded, killing hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Iraqi men, women and children? This film also reveals this administrations incestuous connection to corporations in the oil industry and responsible for building the war machine - Halliburton, (Vice President is an ex CEO) Lockheed Martin, (Mrs. Cheney is on the board of directors) Kellogg, Brown and Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, have exclusive contracts in the "reconstruction" of war torn Iraq. The central "money-connection" is the Saudi Arabians, who spend billions of dollars in Washington DC through various lobby groups, more than anyone else. Strangely, the Bush family and the bin Laden family have been in business together and continue a lucrative relationship to this day. As the bin Laden's and the Saudi's were the only people allowed to fly out of the country during 9/11, shows that the administration at least has enough sense not to bite the hand that feeds them. This is a brave film that reveals evidence of deep-seated corruption in the highest echelons of government. What is mind boggling is that ten years ago, these men would have been dragged in front of senate committees, investigated and brought to justice for lying to the American people, but it seems no one can touch them. Why? The World According to Bush is a serious film without the fanfare and unnecessary hype - it presents the evidence and leaves it to the viewer to decide. A telling film of power and corruption.  
This documentary will open your eyes to the true nature of evil and tyranny. When your tired of being distracted by Martha Stewart, Michael Jackson, and runaway brides, turn your attention to whats really important...the morally shameful and downright criminalistic policies and actions undertaken by our "president" and his hawkish administration. Corruption runs deep and wide and the scariest part is that most Americans remain shockingly silent. Wake up America. Watch this DVD 
It's amazing with all the docu's that have been made documenting the presidency of the Texacutioner how anyone can focus in harder and more precise than what has already been done. This film does. It can't be explained anymore plainly than this. It cannot be put anymore layman-like than this. This speaks clearly to all with ears. I cannot for the life of me understand why so many people support this oaf. This crooked oaf. Who exactly supports putting more money in the credit card companies wallets? Who are these people who wish to not make EVERY effort to cure disease through stem-cell research? What kind of human actually supports the writing of an energy policy by oil companies? What kind of Americans are for the dismantling of the Judicial system, the very system that keeps EVERY American protected from being told what to think, see, hear, and say by any crazy minority? Who actually wishes to let the federal government keep states from re-counting votes cast in a presidential election? Who exactly wishes for the tax code to be slanted heavily in favor of those who are already more than comfortable financially than 90% of the rest of the public? The asleep at the switch Bush supporters who have let the government do their thinking for them, that's who. The Bush supporters who are so intent on keeping power that they will sacrifice the safety of themselves and their countrymen to keep power. The same people who voted for Bush for "compassionate" governing. The same who voted for Bush to bring "integrity" to the White House. Where are these people today? Fast asleep ignoring the world around them and taking solace in stupid yellow ribbon magnets on their SUV's and wrapping themselves in the flag feeling safe with the knowledge that "they hate us for our freedom". They are asleep in the warm light of only 5 people owning ALL the media which is basically EVERYTHING you see on TV, hear on the radio, and read in magazines! 5 people working together to keep the status quo of making sure to not rock the money boat long enough for the people to wake up and see the unethical bahaviouir of these powers that be fighting tooth and nail to stay on top and keep the money flowing in. We're being sold a bill of goods and the American public, as a whole, are blissfully unaware, and we like it that way. we're ripe for the picking. Watch the movie. If you disagree with this, these are the salad days for you then. You are the 10% of the entire population of the US, and screw you, jerk off! You're nothing more than a lucky lottery winner, you work no harder than anyone else 
There are plenty of anti-Bush films and books around. If you only shall see or read one, this must be the best pick. I like Michael Moore very much, but he is not really a political heavyweighter. And i don't think Fahrenheit 9/11 is his best work, it does not mix humour and political insight as well as the book "stupid white men" for instance. It is more like two or three movies in one. William Karel IS a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary. But what a documentary it has turned out to be. Very disturbing insights from informed sources, among them former CIA-agents. It is not usual to hear such plain speaking from "people in high places" just a few years after the events. This film is perhaps not as entertaining as Fahrenheit 9/11, but far more informative. 
Four years ago when this country stupidly sent a corrupt, hideous, half witted frat boy by the name of George W. Bush to the oval office - TO THE WHITE HOUSE - we effectively pointed the proverbial loaded pistol at our own collective head. On election night 2004, make no mistake about it, we pulled the trigger. If after viewing this film you are not outraged, you didn't pay attention. Tom Degan Goshen, New Yor 
Julia Roberts gave a brilliant performance here as Erin Brockovich, a single mother who's temper is about as short as her skirts. When she loses her case against the doctor who caused the car accident she was involved in she somewhat forces her way into a clerical job at the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the lawyer that lost her case. After reading a few files and growing genuinely concerned about a few clients Erin decides to investigate a case involving poisoned water supply that is slowing killing off the residents in Hinkley, California. Julia gives such an effortless performance here that she doesn't even appear to be acting. Everything is so natural, and that can be said for her cast mates as well. Albert Finney is brilliant as the lawyer who's as offset as he is intrigued by his new employee's personality. He perfectly compliments her in every scene they share, and the same can be said for Aaron Eckhart who plays George, Erin's neighbor who falls in love with her and offers her the stability she's always needed and never received. This film, if nothing else, is a beautiful canvas for these talented actors, but acting aside, the script helps move the film along effortlessly and smoothly offering a top notch movie experience that never grows weary or tired 
This 2000 release stars Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. As much as I enjoyed Pretty Woman, that performance doesn't compare to the excellent work Julia did portraying Erin Brockovich. Years ago, Albert Finney gave an excellent Tom Jones (classic movie, not the singer) portrayal. I'm a paralegal and relate strongly to this movie - all the research and paper processing, the concern for clients, the knuckle-biting waits hoping verdicts are delivered favorably. It's a true story making it even more interesting. Erin is a down-on-her-luck divorced mother of 3, just trying to make ends meet. She has a personal injury case after a vehicular accident, and is represented by the attorney who, after her case is lost at trial, becomes her boss (she kinda forces herself into his payroll). While working at the attorney's office, Erin happens upon the beginnings of a major class action suit against a water company that has been knowingly poisoning the residents of a town with chromium, a rust inhibitor. Nasty stuff, that chromium, when ingested. Will Erin and her boss persevere for their clients? The real-life Erin Brockovich plays a bit part in the movie - she's a waitress at a diner 
There have been emblematic films that plainly, justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment. But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one. We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far, the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year. One more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and "Requiem for a dream". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major.  Excellent edition and magisterial direction of Steven Soderbergh. 
When i first saw this movie, i thought it was fictitious, so i thought it was boring. but then when i found out it was real, i was really impressed. i'm not really sure how they were able to document it since at the time JULIA ROBERTS was a nobody. i also didn't know that she used to work at a lawfirm. I mean, i'm not really sure how documentaries work, but why did they decided to make a documentary about JULIA ROBERTS? they couldn't have known what she was going to discover. anyway, i'm really really glad that they did because it was really amazing and touching. And look at all the people who became actors because of this movie! wow. wow, wow, wow, wow, wow 
Watching Julia Roberts play a jobless, skillness single mother whose greatest glory in life was winning a local beauty pageant, might make you wonder what she really thinks. Though Erin Brockovich achieved success far beyond what most in her position would, Roberts is consistently playing down to a station far beneath her own. While not unique in this film or for this actress, its particular noticeable in the contrasts here. Roberts is the only true "welfare queen" that ever lived, the Queen of Hollywood playing a destitute single mother, giving a chance for the "common American" (or at least the lower middle class single mothers out there) to live vicariously through her. Does she actually empathize with her subject or feel only a professional patronizing cynicism, as if we, the peons of life, must watch a film like this to lift us up from our "hum-drum little lives" (to borrow a quote from Jean Hagen)? Cynical or empathetic, Erin Brockovich at least manages to deliver. When it takes flight from reality it is entertaining and when it hits home on everyday realities it is deeply troubling. A sharp reverse in gender roles is deeply evident, with the pedagogically talented boyfriend watching the kids 24/7 while Brockovich goes off to pursue the substance of the film. Once this logistical arrangement is established, the boyfriend's screen time drops off dramatically, and it might seem at times that we are only to be reminded later that, oh yeah, they still exist (how dull), but that is an unfair interpretation. Brockovich's family gets more screen time and substance than the families of the protagonists of any other typical Hollywood thriller would get (Ordinarily we dont see the wife and kids unless they are in physical danger, or unless a sex scene is about to happen). The movie is conscious of its own gender reversal and thrusts the challenge of balancing work and family into the light, tackling the awkward compromises head-on. Indeed, there are very deep though somewhat implicit family values dominating the film, and its to the credit of the scriptwriters that they were able to mix legal thriller and family drama as if they themselves were working parents trying to balance work and home. Certainly a unique film 
Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman." I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones. However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character). Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree). The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel. Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk. Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric. Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium. This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs. Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests. Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and weary attorney who is Erin's boss. The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters. Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience. The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case. Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers. The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant. Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source. Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich. Is the movie entertaining-absolutely. Inspiring- not even slightly. 
What makes Julia Roberts' Oscar winning performance as Erin Brockovich so meaningful is that unlike fellow winners Charlize Theron (Monster); Nicole Kidman (The Hours); and Halle Berry (Monster's Ball), Roberts didn't hide behind makeup or non-glamor to win her trophy. She utilizes her physical attributes and then some in playing the scrappy, but somewhat tawdry, young woman who brings down a corporate giant. Roberts is brilliant in the role and shows a wider range than ever before. She is backed by a wonderful supporting cast including the marvelous Albert Finney as her lawyer boss and friend; Aaron Eckhart as the biker boyfriend who feels cheated in the relationship; Marg Helgenberger as the cancer-stricken client that starts the ball rolling; and Conchata Ferrell as the "krispy kreme" office worker who she spars with. Director Stephen Soderbergh (an Oscar winner for TRAFFIC) wisely keeps the focus on Brockovich's determination and her single motherhood dilemma. It's a very entertaining, and thought-provoking, movie, a showcase for one of Hollywood's modern icons 
This is a great story which has been wrapped in an entertaining sub-story and well acted by all. This is Julia's best work in my opinion. Albert Finney is always a favorite and his role here is absolutely charming. I would highly recommend this film 
Julia Roberts delivers my second favorite performance my first being Pretty Woman well worth the Oscar I love that scene where the guy asks her for her number? Saucy. Julia is at her best here in a story that touches you in a fundamental way and shows that the determination of one person can make a difference. Inspiring!! 
Could fall asleep easily. Reminds me of poly. sci. 101 The Q A session in the end is good. 
This Noam Chomsky speech on DVD is, as usual, enlightening. Mr Chomsky documents the facts, the truths, and his knowledge of terrorism researched over the past years. This speech and the bonus interview with the Harvard audience all point out to to us how easily manipulated each of us are when we passively "believe" what we are told by our government, rather than seeking to "know" the facts (or simply ask, "wait, is that statement true?"). Mr Chomsky explains patiently, that facts are important. Words and meaning cannot be negotiated by idealogical and political spinners. 
Informative, powerful, challenging, stimulating, truthful, stronly recommended to those who are still willing to use common sense and critical thinking when evaulation past and current events 
Noam hates the western world all the while living in america and enjoying the conforts of western civilization. Maybe he should live in a communist country to get some perspective on what his ideas amount to. Some people have told that I dont really know what I am talking about here. I can only recommend them to read what Noam wrote about Cuba. Hope to see you there Noam 
Found this presentation very poor. After reading many of his books prior to seeing him deliver this speech, I was a greatly disappointed. It was a mumbled fumbled repetitive delivery with the most important facts obfusicated with a line like -I think you all know what im referring to here. I suggest read his books they are much better structured and more to the point. I give this dvd one star and repeat- read his books! dont be lazy and expect to get much out of this, I ask myself how can he be an MIT professor with such poor teaching skills, an off (ice) prof ? 
I found it a bit difficult to follow this lecture by Mr Chomsky. It required that I really pay attention and concentrate on what he says ... he is extremely understated with his speech so if you don't take your time and really listen you can miss out on the point he is trying to make. However, when you take the time and truly listen to Mr Chomsky's lectures they blow you away with the simple, accurate info he allows you to see. You start to see yourself as mentally inept while you ask yourself, "my god, that is so simple ... Why didn't I see or think of that?" He really is that good/brilliant. Well thought out lecture by Mr Chomsky that really packs a punch and doesn't mince words. He cleary respects his audience's intelligence and you can learn a lot from this man. 
-Just a note: Get the newer eight dollar version!- After reading several of the reviews it became apparent that I should write one. There are flaws I see with some of the reviews written, I will address them after a quick summary, and cost/benefit analysis. If you haven't heard of Chomsky, read any of his books or seen/heard any of his appearances, this probably isn't for you. I point you to Manufacturing Consent (the quintessential Chomsky DVD about American Culture, media, indoctrination, etc). Whether or not you like Chomsky, this is a good DVD. I'm not going to summarize, (it's already been done), but for the price, this is a good deal. Whether you plan to write a paper on or just want to hear about the state sponsored international terror, hypocrisy, and moral issues in America's past and present; and the future implications of them. For eight dollars this is a great buy. The Q portion of the extras, with fifteen questions, is alone worth the cost. The Q is an hour, with questions from both, people attending at Kennedy School of Govt. (Harvard), and people at MIT. They ask poignant questions with inspired responses from Noam. Now to address comments by reviewers: If you can't handle watching something without constant cuts, mind numbing music and lots of Hollywood glitz: this isn't for you. If you can't handle C-SPAN or a college lecture, this isn't for you. If you like Chomsky, and are willing to watch something that isn't the slightest bit reminiscent of the MTV beach house(like ... uh... what's it called? a documentary!) then check this out. Most people outside of college and the scholarly community are unaware of, or don't think about many of the points Chomsky argues in his books, lectures and public appearances. For that reason many people will dismiss what Prof. Chomsky says outright; however, if you are open to things that go against the "general American consensus": then take a look at this. This DVD looks at some of America's past and present forays in international terrorism. Chomsky presents many well documented facts, he demonstrates his sources, and makes a statement similar to, "check it out and make up your own mind." That's exactly what I suggest you do. I suggest you weigh the pros/cons and see if you think this is worth it. In my opinion, for this amount, this can be a great addition to anyone's collection of doc's. -Just a note: Get the newer eight dollar version! 
once again, chomsky shows he is one of the most brilliant men alive! It's all America's fault! - the evils of capitalism! long live socialism! yet the man is able to publish the same book every six months and charge $14.95 for it BRILLIANT! from marxist to capitalist in one easy printing! 
This is about an actual event carried in the L.A.Times 20 years ago. It's about a tough-as-nails high school math teacher, Jaime Escalante, in a gang-ridden barrio school teaching his students to overcome low expectations, racism and bigotry to become the top calculus class in the country. I'm a teacher myself, and met Escalante back when the film came out. Actor Ed Olmos plays Escalante perfectly. You're watching the real stuff here 
I am a math teacher myself so I have always had a special interest in this film. I think it is very well done and it is very inspirational. However, for anyone who wants to know the TRUE story of what happened with Escalante and his students, purchase the book "Escalante: The Best Teacher in America" by Jay Mathews. The film leads you to believe that Escalante took students who didn't know how to multiply and then in the course of one school year made those same students score 5s on the AP Calculus test. This is far from what really happened. Escalante spent YEARS developing a program and he made sure he had proper courses that led to an understanding of Calculus. There is one other noticeable bit of fiction in the film. The movie portrays it as the testing company (ETS) accused the students of cheating simply because the company was racist and they felt the students at Garfield High School couldn't have possibly known the material. The true story is that some answers on the AP tests from Garfield were noticeably similar. About 12 students made the same exact errors on one particular problem, and that is what made ETS suspicious. So once again, a well done film, and while is it "based on a true story", it is far from a true story 
I received the DVD in a timely manner. The quality of the DVD was good. I have had good service from Amazon. Overall, it was a good experience and a good product 
I enjoy this movie very much . and amazon.com is great to deal wit 
This video provides an honest report on the trials of high school students as well as the ability to overcome racial profiling. A great resource for teachers whom have cultural diversity in their classroom 
I enjoyed most of this movie and applaud its central message: that kids (and people) rise to meet expectations, and that the socioeconomically disadvantaged are not necessarily lacking in intelligence but only in resources and opportunities. However I found the movie not entirely satisfying because it does not really show just HOW Jaime Escalante turned these kids around, other than being creative, charismatic and persistent. As a former teacher myself of high school kids from a similar background as the ones portrayed in this movie, I know firsthand that what Escalante achieved is not impossible but it's not quite so clean and simple as shown here, but is extremely hard grueling work that often entails breaking through a lot of the students' ingrained patterns and applying a lot of painstaking coercion. The director, Ramon Menendez, seems to present a fairly sanitized and glib version that glosses over a lot of the underlying social problems that are endemic to the urban poor while sometimes relying on some stock movie cliches (the tough guy who's really a softie at heart, the big seemingly dumb lunk, etc.). In short, "Stand and Deliver" lacks the kind of rawness, grit and ballsiness that could've made it more than just another well-meaning, triumphant and feel-good movie. It could have been a movie that asks questions instead of spooning out pat answers. It's too bad a real master like Martin Scorsese did not direct this one 
I used this movie as part of my Hispanic Heritage Month (october) lesson in the classroom. We did a study of Jaime Escalante and Salvador Dali. The children really enjoyed the movie. We just watched the classroom scenes (teacher's version of editing for content and time), while I explained what was happening. My class loved it and so did I 
Superbly directed by Menndez for PBS's American Playhouse, "Stand and Deliver" is a cut above most motivational storytelling, because it bypasses sentimentality in favor of a more complex, authentic tone. Olmos is a marvel as Escalante, a brilliant but idiosyncratic educator, and he deservedly nabbed an Oscar nomination. Among a dynamic supporting cast, Lou Diamond Phillips also impresses as the troubled youth who faces a choice between gang life and academic glory. 
This is a great "feel good" movie, but Hollywood altered the story for theatricality. In the film, a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up, in one year, to become calculus winners. There is a good backgroud article at: http://reason.com/0207/fe.jj.stand.shtml that describes how the process took ten years, so that the original group of future-burger-flipping students were not the ones who passed the AP calculus exam. Jaime Escalante (played by Edward James Olmos of "Miami Vice" fame) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time, reaching back to the junior high school that fed Garfield High. The way that the movie was done, however, allows the viewers to see some of the decision-making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them, especially their parents. Remarkably, at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under Escalante's leadership. That's 400 fewer future employees for KFC and MacDonald's. (As Escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student, "So tough guys don't do math - tough guys deep fry chicken for a living?") Eventually, it appears that the Education Establishment won out, driving the brilliant teacher out, and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future. The idea is great, that no student should be regarded as hopeless, and that all should be encouraged to try, but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows. 
Stand and deliver is one of my favorite movies. It's the story of a man who begins teaching at a high school in the slums of Los Angeles, expecting to teach Computer Science. When he arrives what he instead finds is that there is not computer department, and he's stuck teaching basic math to a bunch of social misfits. The beginning of this movie sets the stage wonderfully by showing us the kind of people who inhabit the city as he drives through it on the way to the first day of school. When he arrives at the school we see the students in their natural environment (and a rough one it is). What is a teacher to do?  The protagonist of this awe-inspiring story (Jaime Escalante) is a wonderful example of what can happen when a person chooses to adapt to certain environments and NOT adapt to others. When he's given the task of educating a group of kids that includes some scary gang-member type looking kids, instead of acting like a teacher he acts tough right back (reminding them that they're in HIS domain). Yet, when he's brought into a room with the other teachers and school staff, he goes against the grain. When the school's head advisor tells the principle that everyone is doing their best, he immediately says that he's not. And when she tells the principle that Escalante is asking too much of his students, he boldly tells her that the students will rise to the expectations of their teacher.  This alone makes the movie interesting. But what adds even more drama to situation is the fact that each and every student in the class Escalante teaches has their own peer pressures to deal with. Some students have unsavory friends who would laugh at their taking a class seriously. Some of the students have boyfriends or girlfriends who don't understand their sudden interest in school. And some of the students have to deal with parents who don't understand why their education should come before taking care of their own family.  As the movie progresses Escalante announces to the board that he wants to teach Calculus to his best students, despite the fact that the students hadn't studied any of the prerequisites for the course. Naturally this requires them to study through their summer break, and then six days a week with extra hours! In any teen environment there is always peer pressure. But what happens when positive peer pressure conflicts with negative peer pressure? When our gang-member type Angel first starts the class he is hesitant to get involved because of his rough and tough friends. When Escalante singles him out however, the pressure of the teacher is greater than the pressure of his "friends". Over time this has a tremendous effect on him. Towards the end of the movie, he's riding with his friend and starts acting stupid, and gets his friend a traffic ticket. When the guy becomes angry with him and wants to fight, Angel just walks away. What does this say about him as a person? To me, it shows that whether he likes it or not, he no longer belongs with his old associates, he's now turning into a responsible individual. As I said before, at the outset of the movie Escalante is the one who is thrown into pressure groups. He could become just like the other teachers, or just become uncaring like the kids in his class were initially. What he does instead is nothing short of a miracle. He uses his understanding of human nature, and the natural tendency of people to work better when their thoughts are united to his advantage. His class becomes its own little world, a club for the elite, the strong and the brave. And early on, when one of the students refuses to take a test, the other students quickly turn against her and ridicule her. She then quickly becomes obedient and gets back to work (positive peer pressure was too much for her). The harder the students are pushed and the more is expected of them, the more they feel like a team (how can I forget the scene where a student says that the rest of the class will have a better chance of making it without him?).  The driving force of the scholastic miracle (and this movie) is Escalante. As he himself said, if the students don't have the desire, he will give it to them. And that's exactly what he did. He MADE them want to succeed. He MADE them have the motivation to keep pushing and striving for higher and higher goals. Basically, he educated them on how to be successful and hard-working individuals. People who normally wouldn't have anything to do with each other (computer nerds, homeboys, and rockers) all were united by their desire to achieve and make themselves into something great. They pushed themselves harder than anyone had ever done in their lives, and when push came to shove, they were successful in every way. Every single student Escalante taught passed the exam for college credit. Every one. Motivation is a powerful thing, and sometimes if you don't already have it an extraordinary person can give it too you. Everyone should see this movie 
This is the worst Workout tape that I have ever purchase, the trainer switches moves to quick and doesnt explain what she is doing like she expects you to know before hand what she is about to do. I am personally gonna smash my copy of it. Only reason I gave it 1 star is because the ratings dont go lower 
What's nice about this exercise video is that you don't realize how much time goes by!!! You do a 40 min workout in what feels like 20 min!! The women are all very in shape, but I found that actually motivated me!! (I wanted their abs!!)At first, I thought the salsa dancing would be difficult but it was actually pretty easy!! I have absolutely no coordination and by the end of this video it actually makes you feel like a sexy dancer!! Something I never thought I would feel!! Overall, great video when you are just getting back into the exercise scene! 
I don't usually call any form af exercise fun so I bought this video hoping that dancing my way to fitness might work for me. I really like this video because even though I am not coordinated and I have no sense of rhythm I can actually do this video and enjoy myself in the process. It took me about 3 times doing the workout before I was comfortable with the steps but even if you mess up the steps you are still getting a good workout. Maybe exercisers that are used to an hour of heart pumping, high impact aerobics might find this video a little easy and maybe authentic salsa dancers might think that the moves are not true latin dance but if you are like me and want a fun, fast easy to follow video, this is a great choice 
This DVD was fun to work out to. I enjoyed the music selection 
This is a good workout video to get your heart pumping without you even realizing it. You have to get past the campy set and the over-exuberant teacher to really enjoy. I recommend it. 
Giselle is so cute and energetic it just keeps you going. The workout didn't really seem very much like dancing, it really was just a fun cardio workout. Fun! Fun 
I utilize this tape on those days that aren't scheduled "off" days but on which I really have a hard time gathering the oomph for my usual high intensity workouts. I do break a sweat, but I have dance experience and can embellish moves as needed. In general, I love dance but despise dance workouts, (boring and often annoying), but this instructor is genuine and her choices and pacing are appropriate. Further, she breaks the video down into mini-routines, so if you wanted to, you could memorize the routines and mix and match them to your own music, (she provides counts - mostly 8 but some 4 16 - throughout the video). The background dancers have typical bodies rather than being ridiculously skinny with huge boobs, which is a nice change. Finally, if you do not emphasize your core and hip movements, this workout will be much less effective, so if you haven't danced before and aren't used to posture and breathing, keep in mind that you will need to focus on using these muscles, or your moves will be too sloppy to provide a workout 
This is the worst work out tape i've ever purchased...its a waste of money...there is nothing latin about this tape..and her moves are so repetitive...u won't even work up a sweat However the viva latin rhythm work out was excellent...highly recomende 
I did not like it. I was expecting a bit more of salsa steps instead it looks more like gymnastic. Not good if you know what latin dance means 
I liked this film a lot. The big flaw in this release can be summarized in one word, Disney. It was not the "name" American actors I found distracting, it was the lines the writers chose for the voiceovers. In typical (current) Disney fashion, the script contains colloquialisms that are so up to date, they are already dated. The engineer character is also given superfluous, decidedly feminist lines that are absent in the Japanese version (if I may rely on subtitles for that evaluation). On first viewing the Disney-dubbed English version, I noted that the Curtis character appeared to be a caricature of an American as seen through a Japanese (or Italian) person's eyes. Comparing the Japanese version, I find that Disney injected a lot of explicit Ugly American into the Curtis character, having Curtis deriding the French language or shouting the ridiculous "here comes the American" (both absent in the Japanese version). Curtis is plenty boastful and arrogant (and tall) in the Japanese version, and anyone but a small child would observe he's being portrayed in a certain way. Disney did not help the presentation of this character by laying out his personality for consumption at the fourth grade reading level. It is very typical of recent Disney to spell things out and ruin them, after the movie writer skillfully wove the same message into the script well enough that anyone over the age of 10 with a 90 or better IQ could figure it out. On the plus side, everything said so far. Porco's initial negotiations with the engineer are brilliant (English or Japanese), and the portrayals of motion and old mechanical airplanes make the movie intensely visually interesting. I give the Japanese version a 5 and the Disney-English version a 3 (2.8 is more like it). Luckily, this product contains both. Split the difference and call it a 4. 
I must say that this is not my favorite Miyazaki film but it definitely caught my interest and my imagination still, as this great director always does. I would not say Porco Rosso should be your first Miyazaki experience, but it's definitely one that I'm proud to have in my collection 
You can feel that they makes a great work of research,the places, the things,the people,it's incredible.....one for all, Milan it's like the real city.It's for these reason that i like Miyazaki's works,it's a pleasure relax yourself with amzing tales and fantastic draws 
I don't know anime, but I know what I like. Or do I? The idea of an animated feature about a pig flying an aeroplane sounded a little silly, but I actually found "Porco Rosso" pretty enjoyable. The film, more or less, is about an expatriate Italian pilot of the 1930s who has the head of a pig, thanks to a strange experience many years ago. He's a bounty hunter who battles air pirates and rescues hostages. Even though it's a little tetchy and in need of a tune up, his red aircraft is beautiful and suits him very nicely. The pirates want him grounded and so do the Italian fascists (unless, of course, he decides to work for them). But no, Porco would "rather be a pig than a fascist", and continues to fly the skies solo, feeling sorry for himself in a gruff, quiet sort of way. That all may change soon, though... I'm sure that this film wouldn't have been half as nice to watch if director Hayao Miyazaki wasn't so passionate about aviation and the Studio Ghibli team wasn't so passionate about motion. Though it isn't as colourful and strange as, say, "Spirited Away", it is a beautiful looking film, and has Miyazaki's signature style all over it. It's a film a more light hearted and sparse than his others, I reckon. There's not an awful lot that happens, and when it's often rather silly (especially with the air pirates). My brother was in stitches at some parts, actually. The English dub features Michael Keaton as Porco. I thought it was him, but I wasn't sure until I checked the credits. Does a decent job, catches the surliness of the pig-pilot, but makes him likeable and friendly too. It's good for what it is, light entertainment, and worth a look for anime fans, but if you're just getting into Hayao Miyazaki, I'd recommended seeing a film like "Spirited Away" or "Castle of Cagliostro" first 
maybe because I didn't like Porco. Everything was sub-par for me. Animation is definitely not as good as his later movies. Not enough weirdness, tried too much for the plot. Everything was just too ho-hum. As if he tried to carry the whole movie on Porco's shoulders. But once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and Porco was a pig there wasn't anything else there. 
1992's Porco Rosso tells the tale of Marco, a human WWI pilot cursed to become half-man, half pig. Marco (or Porco) spends his days fighting against sea pirates and evading capture by the Italian Secret Police, as well as visiting the lovely Gina, owner of the swanky Hotel Adriano. Brash American newcomer Curtis (clearly in the mold of actor Ronald Reagan) agrees to fight Marco for honour, and shoots his plane down. A love triangle between Curtis, Marco, and Gina only serves to complicate matters. Marco must sneak into Italy for repairs, where he meets seventeen-year-old Fio, a talented and beautiful engineer. The two work together to rebuild Marco's plane into a sleek, sophisticated fighting machine, and an all-out brawl ensues as the pirates fight for Fio's honour (and hand in marriage). Marco is now torn between the two women: Gina, wife of a former comrade and old flame, and the young, enthusiastic Fio. The ending is left open, but with clues... "Porco Rosso" is the first of Miyazaki Hayao's fables aimed squarely at adults rather than children. There is a lot of smoking and alcohol, off-colour comments towards women, and comic violence. Miyazaki had the chance to spend an entire film dedicated to his love of flying, and the attention to detail of the many planes in the movie is amazing. I didn't like this as well as other Miyazaki classics like "Kiki" and "Nausicaa," but it was an enjoyable romp nonetheless. 
During the first few minutes of "Porco Rosso", I was thinking, 'okay, this is.....different. It's good but I don't think it's exactly gonna be "Spirited Away" or "Naussicaa"'. I should have known better. It IS different, it's not "Spirited Away" or any other Ghibli movie before or since, but it is, in its own bizarre way, just as good. Studio Ghibli seems to be incapable of delivering anything short of true excellence. The title character is a grumpy bipedal pig who flies a World War I-era airplane in the Mediterranean in the years between the two world wars. Once human, Porco has adopted an air of disinterested apathy to cover his feelings, but he finds himself drawn to a group of people in Italy after his plane is shot down by a rival pilot, rendering Porco unable to make a living protecting transport and passenger ships from pirates - some of the most gloriously incompetent pirates imaginable, by the way. "Porco Rosso' is suitable viewing for the kiddies but may be, in general, enjoyed more by an older audience - in addition to the soaring air battles and action-packed climax, there's plenty of romance, dry humor, and subtle political commentary. Regardless, it has the Ghibli charm, and is likely to have something for almost everyone. A truly one-of-a-kind movie (ask youself this: when was the last time you saw a movie about a trenchcoat, goggles and fedora-wearing pig piloting a brightly painted red airplane and fighting sky pirates?) and another jewel in the glorious Ghibli crown 
One of Moriyama's best, featuring first rate animation, story and dialogue. The fist fight scene probably makes this film better for the 10-and-over crowd, but the real audiences for this masterpiece are adults who appreciate beautiful animation, 1930's-style heros, and the sounds of radial aircraft engines. Accurate details rivaling those of Herge's famous Tintin comic book series make this a jewel. The english language version has a few voices that could have carried a little more believable emotion, but this is a very minor complaint and is something most viewers will probably not even notice until the third or fourth viewing. Porco Rosso deserves a top ranking in any movie collection. 
Porco Rosso is by far my favorite Miyazaki film due to its witty humor and the anti-war theme. Althrough kids might not fully understand the movie, none of the content is actually "mature" enough that a whole family cannot enjoy this movie together. The music and scores are fambulous as usual since Miyazaki and Hisaishi combined both their expertise together FLAWLESSLY. I admit, I'm the pickiest person when it comes to voices matching personalities, but I really can't complain about the dubbing for this movie. It is actually enjoyable and believable as opposed to some dubs for other Miyazaki movies. The script follows the original quite closely. That makes me happy. Good Job! The only thing I had a problem with was that they did not use the original for "Les Temps des Cerises" and the ending theme. I liked the voice of the original singer (Tokiko Kato) more so then the one they picked (don't know who), but the new one is not bad either. Many might think that the ending is a bit of a blur, but that's Miyazaki's signature (i.e. watch end credit of My Neighbor Totoro and Nausicaa of Valley of the Wind). Miyazaki never does sequel of his films, which I fully agree with since somethings are better left unsaid and left to the imagination (which is a theme in most of his movies), but he does give hints throughout the movie on the ending. As for the actual ending, figure it out for yourself : 
have watched a couple of times and the wit of this movie stands out . The quote about being pig rather than facist still makes me smil 
The acting was decent for the young guys and the movie while predictable was very enjoyable to watch. I would buy this on DVD. Some of the scenes were actually laugh out loud funny 
Teenage hormones are at peak level in this nice little German film 'Sommersturm' or 'Summer Storm' and the result is a set of mini-crises that tumble young people all the time: first sexual attraction, the ambiguity of close friendships, the trials and lessons of first sexual encounters, and the manner in which teenagers survive their sexual decisions amongst their peers. Director Marco Kreuzpaintner and writer (with Thomas Bahmann) set this attractive coming of age film on the playing field of crewing, a sport that demands full attention and intense cooperation from every team mate. Two teams from Bavaria, one of boys and the other of girls, take off for a summer camp training session where they encounter another crew from Berlin, a crew that just happens to be composed of gay young boys. The Bavarian boys' crew team is lead by two long-term friends - Tobi (Robert Stadlober) and Achim (Kostja Ullmann) - and while their friendship is strong, Tobi is discovering that his feelings for Achim go far deeper. The two share stories about their girlfriends - Anke (and beautiful Alicja Bachleda-Curus) and Sandra (Miriam Morgenstern) who head the girl's crew team. At the summer camp Tobi's feelings for Achim deepen and the influence of the team of very handsome young gay boys on the opposing team only serve to heighten the tension. Tobi eventually has an encounter with a particularly tender and understanding Leo (Marlon Kittel) and as the questions begin to arise a violent storm makes the entire group flee for cover. The manner in which Tobi comes out to his team and to Achim is the very tender dï¿½nouement of the story. The storm raging in Tobi (as well as in other members of the team) settles into the aftermath. Some viewers may find this film too explicit for general viewing but for this viewer the encounters all around remain tasteful and touching. The director seems to be telling us that the 'first experience', whether that is gay or straight, is or can be traumatic as well as fulfilling. The cast does well: there are many very beautiful young boys and girls who play their roles with a natural simplicity and allure. For a young director (only 29 years old and this is his fifth film) Kreutzpainter seems to have a solid future. Grady Harp, September 06  
(.....just listen to the breathing........)  Cute......caring......and collected (at one with himself), the "out" and self-accepting 'Leo' (a wondrous Marlon Kittel) so knows who he is and so knows where 'Tobi' (an amazingly expressive Robert Stadlober) is coming from. Tobi is so......lucky to have Leo for his "first-time." And speaking of that time in most all our lives, this film gives us a "my-first-time" gay love scene which tops all others in the lengths to which it goes......at least in a movie with such youthful characters. It's tender and caring at the same time it's feverish and arousing. Just listen to the breathing......if you think there can be any intensity and turn-on missing from what Kittel and Stadlober bring to us in their dock-side love making scene, you'd have to be deaf, as well as blind. Again, just listen to the breathing......to the sounds of "catching breaths and sighs" (or TURN UP your system, will ya!). Would you say these guys were caught up in what they were doing, or not?  While the film's main relationship, between Tobi and Achim, has probably been a life-long one of fun and childhood loving/caring for one another, we watch as things begin to go terribly wrong when "another kind of love" starts rearing up, as part of this pair's growing up. We come to see that a straight Achim is too free and easy (with his feelings) to be just a friend to someone who's now discovering he is gay and in love. Achim, of course, is not be blamed for being who he's been all along; it's just that so much of who he is becomes misinterpreted by Tobi. I like this movie for its credible acting so much I'd award it an easy 6-Stars. PS--If anything at all disappointed in this work, it was the director's failure to give us, at film's end, a "boarding-the-bus-home" scene in which Leo and Tobi could say their goodbyes. It's inconceivable to me that Leo, so deeply affectionate of Tobi, would fail to take the time to do so. Obviously, we can expect little to come of their relationship, since a seemingly younger Tobi has a goodly amount of growing up and finding himself yet to do. However, I think of T. as being very aware of what he owes to Leo's help in making him much more comfortable with who he is. He just wouldn't have departed without a thank-you to Leo....something that would have been important for us to see.  PPS--Director Marco Kreuzpaintner sure gets the "teen angst" thing right, pulling an awful lot of it out of his young cast. But, then, at 25 or so when shooting, he's only about 5 years older than they. Looking at his bio-pics elsewhere on-line, it's easy to see how he, himself, could have handily assumed one of these attractive young player's roles.  *** 
This is by far one of these best gay-themed films I have seen since "Beautiful Thing" (released in 1996) - and one of the best films (of any kind) that I have watched since "Crash". You will laugh out loud, and cry as you feel the agony Tobi endures while coming to terms with his sexuality. Tobi (played flawlessly by Robert Stadlober) is the leader of his rowing team, and looked up to by his teammates for leadership. When his team is up against another rowing team comprised of an all-gay team, his inner feelings are realized. Tobi deals with his feelings and love for his best friend Achim, and eventually deals with the complications of coming out to him. All the while dealing with confused emotions for his girlfriend and a new boy he meets on the opposing team. The film is genuine, well-directed, well-acted and goes head-on with the painful emotions most younger people must face when trying to understand their sexuality. THIS STORY IS REAL! And proves once again that we truly cannot help who we fall in love with. Love is about following your heart - it's about people, not the sex of the individual's involved. The movie hails from Germany, and is in German with English subtitles. Even with having to read the film to understand it, the talent of the young actors shines through. Not only was I impressed by the story, even the movies scenes and settings were delightful. Kudos to here! Films, Genius Products and Liberation Entertainment for producing this movie. It's a shame Hollywood USA can't (or doesn't have the courage) to produce this quality and style of film 
Summer Storm is certainly one of the finer coming out films. The cast is excellent and the portayals have an emotional honesty that is often lacking in gay cinema. However, there are flaws that keep this from being a 5-star film. Some times the director chooses to avoid conversation and confrontation that would have added to the story. Some shots are heavy-handed with symbolism. Finally, the lead character is a selfish one and never apologizes for the emotional and physical pain he causes. This, though, is much like real life and so is a sad element that was probably intended. Otherwise, a film worthy of being on any gay man's shelf 
This film was significant in Germany because Robert Stadlober is a popular young actor and band member there whose coming out in the character of Tobi was unsettling. Certainly Kostja Ullmann as Achim, his buddy and secret love, is cute enough to win many hearts. And his pretend love interest, Alicja Bachleda-Curus as Anke, is sweet and beautiful enough to convince nearly anyone that being gay is NOT a lifestyle choice. When another rowing team bold enough to call themselves the QueerStrokes (which actually exists) shows up, Tobi gets to see the spectrum of gay characters, from manly Malte to effeminate Nils; and Marlon Kittel as Leo sure takes in an eyeful of Tobi as he bides his time. Seeking refuge from a raging storm (and from an increasingly stormy relationship with Achim) in a closed hostel building brings some closer together, and drives others apart. There isn't much new for American audiences in that there have been a number of equally well done coming out films here, but Summer Storm rings true because it is at least partly autobiographical for director and writer Marco Kreuzpaintner, and Stadtlober and Ullmann certainly have chemistry together to spare as mates. In fact the whole crew seemed to be having a really good time. The film ends with Tobi arriving home from the summer rowing camp a changed boy. Stepping off the bus and facing his front door his stern look changes to a faint smile. A small touch, but a reason Robert Stadtlober has won awards, and why the film will win aclaim 
The songs on this DVD are very clear and the best collection of ABBA songs around. The videos overall are comical since the steps and production appear so scripted. None the less, the videos are very entertaining if you are a true ABBA fan 
$10.97. Free shipping. 35 great tracks. Wonderful! Since I haven't been to an ABBA concert in over 25 years, this was a real trip in a time machine. What else could a fan want? Check out the bonus picture gallery too. A video scrapbook included for free. ABBA fans, this is a must. 
This exactly what the title says, It's a comprehensive presentation of ABBA songs with excellent photography. I'm glad I bought it 
I am generally not a fan of rock/pop music, though I do have my favorites. ABBA is right at the top of my list. Yes the sound on this DVD is dated and the video's look like early prototypes, but unless you are in that .00003% of the world's population who cannot stand ABBA, you absolutely need this collection. And at the price (currently $11.00--Amazon), you need to order it today. Great fun! As a bonus, these videos, especially "Mama Mia," will make the ABBA knock-off performance in _Muriel's Wedding_ even more enjoyable. 
This DVD is a must for Abba fans. The videos are in chronological order so it is great to see them so young in "Ring Ring" and to watch them mature video by video. "Take a chance on me" is my fave but they are all awesome showing sides of Anna and Agnitha you will never see elsewhere! Also, the photo slide show alone is worth the price. Do yourself a favor and "take a chance" on this DVD!! 
This collection of music videos just makes me smile and feel warm. The video concepts are low tech (Agnetha and Anni-Frida sing at each other, facing 90 degrees away from each other or into mirrors) but they are so earnest and the music so upbeat (even when they are singing about the break up of their repectives marriages) that I couldn't resist singing along. The DVD is worth the purchase alone just to see the progression of the women's hairstyles from poodle perm to sleek flat ironed to cranberry colored mullet with a headband 
I am writing this review for those not yet familiar with the music of ABBA. I am old enough to remember them in their heyday, but was not into the music of the 1970's at the time. I became an ABBA fan after having the chance to see "Mamma Mia" twice in New York City. I bought the CD that goes with this DVD and I was hooked with their very singable peppy lyrics. If you are not familiar with their songs, give their music and this DVD a chance and you will find yourself becoming pleasantly addicted 
Almost all these videos are exceptionally good and I don't think they look dated. I think these ABBA videos looked good then and look REALLY good now. They are watchable and aren't flashing images like what MTV has been playing the past 10+ years where the MTV "diva" women look like retired porn actresses and the men like ex convict metal rappers who are never shown for more than a secord or two and thank God for that. The ABBA women still are cool to look at in these videos. Excellent videos!  
There was one other reviewer here who was definately right. "ABBA: The Definative Collection" on CD is really all you need. ABBA is great music. I don't know any female singers who can match their talent and energy when they sing. However, these videos are nothing impressive. Lasse Hallstrom should only just be mentioned for making these mediocre videos. He certainly deserves no outstanding praise. You would think that it would be exciting to watch these girls sing these songs. But these girls don't look like they are expressing the energy that you would expect to see with these exciting songs. If I were allowed to mildly exaggerate just a little, in many cases here, it looks like we are just looking at a photograph, and they creatively made the lips move. They look very stiff, and perhaps a little bored, and if they are dancing, they just seem to be making only a half-hearted effort to just sway to the music. Don't you think that "Dancing Queen" should have had some talented expressive dancing? As a video, the energy just isn't here. They look like they filmed the video just after waking them up. They must have edited out all the yawns. The girls are beautiful, of course, but these videos are just not that interesting. And since these songs are only available on this DVD as 2.0 stereo, having the CD of these fabulous songs is a great deal more of a bargain. Because the sound quality is what you would want to improve on if you're going to listen to ABBA's music. And it wouldn't hurt them if they tried to be a little sexier. There is no sensual teasing in any of these videos. But, yes I know, most of these videos are made long before the MTV video age. But, regardless, every ABBA fan should have this video collection. However, I get more out of ABBA when I just shut my eyes and listen to their beautiful songs. I think their most impressive song is "Chiquitita". It is a perfect song! Beautiful guitar and orchestration, and the girls hit some fabulous high notes, and with pristine synchronized harmony. But again, the video here, is just weak and unimpressive. "ABBA: The Definative Collection" on CD is good, but you really should check out the 4 CD box set of "Thank You For the Music". All their best and more are in this collection, and what's more, the fourth disc has some excellent rarities from their entire career span. On the fourth disc, they have a 22 minute collage piece called "Abba Undeleted", that is just fabulous to listen to. They ran a bunch of unfinished songs together, mixed in with some of their session talking in their native tongue, and some instrumentation samples and some cute laughter. Within this collage of many songs, there is a song in there called "Just Like That". I really do wish that they would have completed and released this song as a single. I have no doubt that it would have been their biggest hit ever made. Believe me, if you don't buy all these albums on CD separately, than you, at least, should have their 4 CD collection called "Thank You For the Music". 
I know Gary Moore Is not the greatest on this dvd. I bought it was not very happy.Then I seen another dvd by Gary Moore called Ballads Blues 1982 -1994.Also on the dvd was live Blues with BB King. Since I love blues Gary Moore BB King.It was a Import only a few sellers were selling it.I bought one when It came I put it in my dvd player.This dvd of Gary Moore with BB King blew me away.I went back on amazon to see if there were any more left.They were all gone for about 2 or 3 months.Was told the dvd Is rare hard to find.After keeping my eyes open for a while.It was for sale on amazon again bought 2 more.I did not know if the dvd would be available again.Its a piece of history to own for Gary Moore BB King fans 
Blues-Rock guitar players rarely come any better than the criminally underappreciated Gary Moore. If you love hot guitar playing and have never heard this man before, this is the DVD you need in your collection right away! In this dynamic 1990 performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, we see Gary Moore taking his place alongside Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, and Eddie Van Halen as one of the most POWERFUL guitarists in the world of rock and blues! It is a shame that a guitarist of this calibre is only marginally known here in America. The electrifying solos that dominate this performance show that Gary could easily blow most guitar players right off the stage! This show captures Moore in his prime, right at the point when he switched his style from heavy metal to blues-rock. Most of the songs here are from his excellent 1990 album Still Got the Blues. One of the highlights of the show is a hot performance of "Texas Strut" where Gary pays tribute to Stevie Ray and Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top with some nice impersonations of Gibbons and Vaughan. Another highlight is the special guest appearance by blues legend Albert "Ice Man" Collins who delivers a fine version of the beautiful blues masterpiece "Cold Cold Feeling". Albert sticks around for several more songs too. Gary delights the audience with three encores and finally ends the show with the haunting and searing guitar instrumental "The Messiah will come again". If you care anything about electrifying guitar solos or powerhouse blues-rock music, buy a copy of this sucker and turn it up!  
Having been a Gary Moore fan for about 8 years I was thrilled to see the release of this DVD, and since he doesn't come stateside very often to play live, this was a real treat to see him play. His mastery of guitar is unsurpassed by anyone. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who loves great blues and rock riffs galore!!! 
Buy this DVD if you want to here the best in live blues, a guitar players, Player Gary Moore is a tone machine with a heart and soul. If you play guitar or are thinking of picking one up to learn get this DVD you will never have buyer remorce, you will enjoy this over and over again... Thanks Gary You are keeping the blues guitar alive and well... Notice that on the first song Gary is playen a Heritage H157 made by the guitar builders in Kalamazoo MI they are the same ones who built the first Les Pauls in the fifties. check out Heritageguitar.com and wolfeguitars.com The rest of the show he is playing a Gibson Les Paul, and a Strat. The strat just dont get after it like the Heritage H157. Buy this one its a good one...great DV 
This guy is the best folks! If you're thinking that this is all just slow blues material your very wrong! Gary shreds on every song with conviction. This is the best blues performance i've ever heard 
Gary came out of the shadows for a lot of listeners with his blues albums . The roots of rock can be found in this music and Gary wrote a classic blues tune of his own as well - Still Got the Blues . It was like he had been given a second chance - he certainly grabbed it with both hands , as he does on this recorded evidence . He has a good band here and plays very well . The direction is solid and shows all the players to good effect . If you are a fan of blues or rock guitar played with a lot of passion , then this disc is an essential purchase 
This dvd shows how great Gary Moore really is- this guy just blows!! Makes me want to throw my guitars away, and make coffee tables out of them!! Vintage Gary Moore! 
This DVD shows Gary Moore at the apex of his career which has since gone down the hills.It is still great to hear the note-for-note live version of 'Still got the blues'. The instrumental 'The Messiah will come' is awesome.It should go down as the best rock instrumental of all time. Too bad, Mr. Moore has not been able to replicate his success although his CD 'Stormy Monday Blues' is worth listening. Abu Bakar, Malaysia 
Excellent music and video; if you like the blues, you'll love this collection 
I'm a guitar player of sorts and have been a blues fan for years. ....and have just recently discovered Gary Moore! This DVD is a must have for blues fans and guitarists alike. How good is it? Let me just say that when I first watched this, I thought I had died and gone to guitar heaven! There are many different opinions as to what a "great" guitarist is. I don't know about anyone else, or who gets to say who the "best" is (if there can be such a thing today), but Gary Moore just has to be in the top ten! Why? It's his tone! The sounds he pulls from that Les Paul! His blues phrasing is excellent and refreshing. Incredible note bending and sustain. His version of The Stumble is a masterful demonstration of blues phrasing and a great tribute to Peter Green and of course, Freddy King! Yes, there are the various King influences, but.. .his way of interlacing his phrases with the most searing blues guitar sound that I've ever heard is nothing short of amazing. Still Got The Blues For You is perhaps one of the best blues songs ever written! This whole DVD is blues/rock at it's best. If Gary had not gone into blues, he would have always been a great rock guitarist. What sets him apart (and above) the rest of the great rock guitar players is his ability to grind out the blues. Not everyone can play blues like this. You have to FEEL it--not play it! And boy, does Gary show you how he feels! He draws every ounce of emotion from every single note he plays...especially on "The Return of The Messiah"-- I think Gary Moore has done something very few top rock guitarists can do---create a new sounding blues form with a hard rock edge to it..tough to do with so many "blues" artists around! Get this DVD! It will rock your socks off! It's great and so very cheap(it's actually a steal at this pice)...and the delivery service was fast hassle free...ordered it on Thursday..at my door the next week on Friday 
Micheal Moore made me vomit while watching this movie. America would be a better place if he left here, which he should because he obviously doesn't appreciate everything that his country does for him. His extremely one sided argument has no historical value, and it a piece of brainwashing propaganda that he made in attempt to try to convince more people to hate that country that gives them so much 
Republocrat zombies on the march Heil Bush they chant with glassy eyes Stomp out freedom Subvert the Constitution for their corporate masters Force their fascist god-book down everybody's throats Stare at the tv, it'll all be ok they say Turn off your mind Become infantile like us Soulless neo-con automatons Mindless Flag wavers Slaves of the Dark Lord Bus 
Michael Moore's stunning documentary on the attempt of conservative thinking to distort the liberal point of view is riveting. Moore tells it like it is to the distain of many misinformed conservatives who lead perfunctory lives at best. It is well researched and not slanted as many detractors would have the viewer believe. It is very unbiased and objective in its presentation. 
I am not sure where to start with this movie, or this persuasive visually essay. After all, that is what it is. Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a "1 + 1 = 3" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is "If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie." As for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie. I want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America. As for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think? I suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right? Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought. In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want. Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people. In conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President. 
We saw the movie in the theatre and loved it. The DVD we just purchased was horrible. They chopped out so much of the movie it made it un-watchable. It is only good for a coaster under my drink now 
I'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about Christianity. By now, thanks to this film and the book of the same title, most individuals interested in Christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus. That being said, I will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film, and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses. As a movie the Code leaves much to be desired. There are gaps in the story line and overlooked pieces of evidence in The Louvre museum by the police that no respectable law enforcement agency would fail to detect. For example, Langdon and detective Neveu, after successfully evading Captain Feche in the museum, strike a series of clues (writings, bloodstains, keys) that the entire investigatory team analyzing the crime scene failed to uncover. Langdon and Detective Neveu fail to ask each other seemingly obvious questions that- if answered- might end the movie immediately or take it in a whole new direction. Ian McKellen, a fabulous actor of extraordinary talent, lacks complete credibility in this film. So what went catastrophically wrong? Well, it wasn't the book or its author Dan Brown, who has been selling copies of the Code faster then they can count them. And although the performances were at best questionable, by themselves these are not enough to sink the movie. The most obvious answer as to why the Code is so deficient is Ron Howard, the director. Mr. Howard simply lacked the vision and forethought to successfully and credibly present The Da Vinci Code in a manner believable (as a film, not history) to the audience. I think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings were captured by the mystery and romantic luster most conspiracies are imbued with, and had a pre-formulated supposition of Jesus and his relationship to Mary Magdalene 
When I first heard they were going to turn the Da Vinci Code into a motion picture I was disappointed. It would made a much better mini-series, and I still believe that; however, hats off to Ron Howard (director) and Akiva Goldsman (writer) for making a film that captures the true essence of the novel. What they chose to leave out works and the main storyline remains untouched from the novel. I also wasn't thrilled when I heard Tom Hanks had been cast in the lead role of Robert Langdon, and while his performance was good I still think he was too old for the role. A man in his middle to late thirties would have been a better choice than the aging, pudgy Hanks. Regardless of this small gripe The Da Vinci Code, as a movie, was very good. Even though I've read the novel upon which it is based twice, I still found myself on the edge of my seat as I watched the film. if you liked the novel, you will like the movie 
Holy Mother of Mary! How do you describe a movie that asks you to "seek the truth" where the "truth" puts one of the foundations of Christianity into question? Well, in a nutshell, I'd describe The Da Vinci Code as a classy whodunit with a religious twist. Tom Hanks again proves to be one of the best actors in Hollywood by bringing Dan Brown's character Robert Langdon to life. Rare is it that a film adaptation of a novel is as good as the book. And The Da Vinci Code re-confirms that axiom. But The Da Vinci Code delivers. It's entertaining. Thought provoking. Controversial. Suspenseful. Thrilling....It has all the main ingredients of the book. 2 and a half hours is a bit long, but kudos to Ron Howard and the producers for not editing out key details just for the sake of time. In fact, even at 150 minutes the film adaptation comes up a bit short on explaining the significance of a few of the details that would put the story into a more clear perspective. But overall, it's an enjoyable movie for open minded movie goers. Is it fact or fiction? That's for everyone to decide for themselves. It is indeed a philosophical idiom fielded to the public under the guise of a Whodunit-mystery. 
I read the book before I saw the movie. I am a committed, and devout catholic Christian also, but I never read the book or saw the movie as anything more than exciting fiction...I think all the bashing and alarmism from the religious right was "overblown by the media and many in the Christian community who gladly mined the book and movie themselves for profits...(witness all the "anti-DaVinci" books, movies and audio tapes.) If you are SECURE in your faith the book and film should not affect you. It didn't for me...it actually led me to read more of the Bible and the patristic fathers of the Church. As for the film, well, the book was probably one of the "best" I've ever read. I expected to be disappointed by the movie, but "was not". I thought Tom Hanks and the Cast were GREAT. Don't miss it! Unless of course, you feel it is offensive...As thinking adults we can and should all decide that for ourselves. Atreides  
My review can be summarized as a well recommended movie that is worth at least a rental. But the movie may be worth buying since its release is a blockbuster for the Holidays and has been deeply discounted. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and I would have given it a 3 and a half, if possible. The reason why it is not a four but still a strong three is that the movie was enjoyable and was able to keep a certain amount of suspense throughout but is not something I would watch over again. The movie moves quickly enough and, with out giving anything away, doesn't play the "Hollywood" card very much. The acting and visual elements were done well. The bonus DVD has some interesting behind the scenes value, especially because the film was done in some very historically significant locations. 
Both the dvd and the movie are quite good and interesting, and I watched it with interest. There was a lot of controversy, chasing and mysticism, so if you are into such things you will probably like the movie as well. 
"The LOGO network presents Noah's Arc, which is a show about four human beings dealing with human issues. Each character reminds you a little of yourself and/or someone you many know. It's about four friends, Noah, Alex, Ricky and Chance. Noah is a screenwriter who has fallen in love with Wade, who is also a screenwriter, but happens to be straight (so he claims). Alex works at an HIV clinic and is in a seven year relationship with his partner, Trey (who works in a hospital). Ricky is the owner of a Melrose Avenue clothing store, who is also the promiscuous one of the group. Chance is a college professor who has moved in with his partner, Eddie and his daughter Kenya. All four characters have an equal part to this wonderful story about love, comedy and drama. Patrik Ian Polk is the brain child behind this show, which is a spin off from his cult classic "Punks." This is (in my opinion) the best show on television. The DVD is absolutely worthwhile. It has commentary from the cast and creator, audition footage, the original pilot episode and tons more features. The show is not for everyone, and it doesn't claim to be, but if your into a show that has all the elements that an entertaining show is suppose to have (love, comedy and tons of drama), I'll guarantee you'll be hooked on Noah's Arc."   
I am a customer that just searches through the TV shows to find new and interesting show. Well I saw this show and decided to order since I never heard of it before. I think its a really smart and funny show. I fell in love with it and was hooked after the first episode. If you like trying out new things Noah's Arc is for you 
I love Noah's Arc! The guys are hilarious and so sexy! Every single episode is well written, I wish the season was longer 
I can not tell you how much I have enjoyed this series. I expected it to be kinda lame but it is actually like the drama that goes on daily in most of our lives.I also loved that it had a mix of characters and it wasn't all based on their sexual escapades but issues that gay men go through daily. I hope this seires continues and gets better. I am anxiously awaiting season 2. 
I'll Make this short I could not have made a better purchase. I waited over 8 months for the series to come on DVD and it was worth ever second of waiting. I cant seem to take the discs out of my DVD player. Waiting now for season 2 
I really enjoy the series. Specifically because it is based on the lives of four homosexual black males, which is something unheard of on "Americas's" television network - A gay soap series! Even though African Americans have portrayed homosexual roles on television before, this series almost makes that fact taboo, in the sense that it illustrates the quote on quote everday life of multiple homosexual African American men. I think the plots are very dynamic and the cast is as well. Being that the series compares to much of reality, there can be predictions based on a viewers personal experiences, and in the same breath, there can be suspense. I am very proud to see all of the support not only from the cast, but more so from the viewers. Considering the ratings and popularity of the series, I would have to say that America may be changing just a little. Less than 30 years ago an interracial couple on television was considered taboo... Now we have Noah's Ark. 
I am a fan of Noah's Arc. It is an African American Queer as Folk. Its ground breaking and a delight. I like the synergy of the actors. However, my only problem with it, is the limited amount of time devoted to an episode. If Patrik Ian Polk wants this to really progress he needs to take it to 1 hour and add more depth to the characters. Its good but it can be better. You will definitely have a good laugh :) 
Excellent on DVD as it was on Logo.. actually better because you get to see more. The commentaries are nice because you get to know how the scene was set up, and what the actor was thinking. If you haven't brought this DVD then what are you waiting on? I got a good deal here on Amazon, the price was right and well worth it. Can't wait for the 2nd season to be out on DVD 
It would be nice if black gay characters were neatly mixed in with the likes of a Queer As Folk and shows of the like. Since they aren't, Noah's Arc serves as a nice alternative. I was prepared to hate it, but it's nice to see actors who despite varying levels of acting ability, make a truly valiant and earnest effort to bring a voice and three dimension to the lives of gay black men. I rented it and watched the whole thing and fell in love with it's premise of friendship and personality dynamic. I subsequently bought the series and am looking forward to the next season to be released since LOGO is unavailable where I live. My hope is that Noah's Arc will continue to be a hit and reach audiences outside of the "expected" demographic 
I was very disappointed with this film. I had hoped to learn about the "Birth of a Nation" and "prenatal" life in the region. But the entire film is about postnatal fighting. The film is appropriate for people who find fighting to be glorious - for people who like to keep score of battles and casualties like some kind of sports game. This ugly film depicted the entire society as being barbaric. In fact it sanctified the barbarism as being something heroic. Surely the beautiful people and the rich culture of this region deserve more than this. Surely the viewers deserve more than this History Channel pandering. 
the most beautiful miracle of hshem took place on may of 1948. israel became a nation once again. for 2000 years israel has been displaced and been scattered through out the nations of the world. this is the most touching,heart warming,and gut renching you will ever see on film. makes you want to sob with so much joy and relief to see the holy people of G'D coming back home to the promised land of avraham, yitzhak,and ya'akov. biblical prophecy has been fulfilled. yehoshooah is the gratest miracle, his life and ministry, his death, and ressurection. his whole life mirrors (reflects) exactly what happened too ancient israel and the jewish inhabitants. also vice versa israel mirrors the agony, pain, and death and ressurection of our beloved masheeakh yehoshooah. this movie makes me proud to be jewish, proud to be israeli, and joy in my heart that yehoshooah,the anointed one,and his father in heaven, the holy one of israel, made this all possible that israel would be a nation once again. against all odds israel is still a nation surrounded by arab enemies who want to destroy our country and our people. it is sad to say but true that there are christians who like the arabs feel the same way about us. yet against all odds israel is a nation and a miracle too. bruch hshem (bless G'D) and todah hshem (thank G'D) i know i do every day. i know this film will inspire people.anyone who loves freedom will love this inspiring miracle that came true and was well documented on film. after the agony, suffering,pain, and death of the holocaust joy came afterwards in may of 1948 that joy came when israel became a nation once again. sorrow comes in the evening and joy comes in the morning i have read this in the psalms of king david. the holocaust was the evening and the nation of israel was the morning when joy came to the people. 
My kids 8 11 just cannot get enough of this movie. The story line appeals to them, as does the music and the characters. My younger daughter watched it 3 times in one weekend... 
I got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic -- the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college. Good grief. Since when is a musical ever realistic?? Especially one that is geared to kids. Hello??!! It's not supposed to be realistic! If you expect realism, go elsewhere. But if you want to have some fun with a great message not-so-subtly woven in, then watch this movie. Kids love it (mine do along with anyone else I've talked to), and the message is just terrific ~ it's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc., no matter what anyone else thinks. I love it! I can't even begin to say how much better this is than "Grease," the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be "happy." Relax with your kids, go get some popcorn, and have some fun with the Wildcats kids from "Highschool Musical. 
This is a great family movie, my son and my niece really enjoy watching the movie. I really recommend this movie to familyies with children 
My children (ages 6 and 11) absolutely love HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. My son's drama club is preparing to perform it this spring, and he's very excited about trying out for a part. I enjoyed watching it as well. The musical is set in a fairy tale high school, but what musical isn't a fairy tale? Puppy love and teen rivalry ... all done in a family-friendly Disney way. Walt would have been proud 
Ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house. 8 women, every one of them with their affective lacks, their tribulations. Little miseries, sorrows and disillusions. Each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered Marcel. The admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage, with a sublime red carpet that remind us Bergman in Cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo) expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film, plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses. A must-see! 
Seemingly a French take-off on the classic English Mystery Play format this delightful farce is actually a perfect proof of how great and sexy, women of all ages are (especially French women). Starring: Catherine Deneuve, Virginie Ledoyen, Ludivine Sagnier, Isabelle Huppert, Danielle Darrieux, Fanny Ardant, Firmine Richard, Emmanuelle Bï¿½art 
A previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values, however, even though there are elements of the risque in the film, the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all. I thought that the plot, the scenery, the songs and everything else was all great. It is a French musical whodunnit but one that doesn't take itsself too seriously. Whoever wrote the bad review shouldn't take it so seriously either (besides, it's ridiculous to rip on a countries birthrate as if it is part of the artistic value of a movie, so he should have ranted somewhere a bit more appropriate.) My favorite characters were played by Denouve and Huppert (both of whom are amazing actresses in their own rights) and all of the twists and turns kept me entertained, even though a bit of suspension of disbelief is required. Then again, it is a musical, so disbelief should be left at the door 
Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid 
The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness. Nor even, for that matter, for titillation. When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why. Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played. "Eight Women" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies. Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange. By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience. 
Having stumbled onto this film being played on TV late last night and given that Emmanuelle Bart was in this, I was immediately hooked into watching it. As has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinma francais. Deneuve, Bart, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert......the list goes on. And being that the story revolves around these 8 women ( yes I know but there was really no other way of putting it ), it keeps you locked in. What I found fascinating were the songs. Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes! The basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry. It's that good! Just simply superb. There's nothing else to add 
This farcical "who done it" is funny, absurd, campish, and silly all at the same time. Starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the French cinema, 8 femmes reminds me of similar tongue-in-cheek "who done its" such as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and especially Neil Simon's Murder by Death. Adapted from the play by Robert Thomas, which accounts for the stage play feel to the production, this one begins--as a proper murder mystery might--with a murder in a well-appointed house out in the country. Somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion. While Neil Simon made fun of detectives in Murder by Death, and Agatha Christie made fun of murder, period, here the fun is on the players themselves. What follows, as all point fingers away from themselves, is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about. The scandalous revelations, including interracial lesbianism, same- and heterosexual incest, etc., are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties. (Note Suzon's pink/orange pony skirt.) To quote a line from the film, "it's a sad family affair" played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight. Yet, there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film. Strange. In another sense this is a celebration of some of the French cinema's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs. Catherine Deneuve heads the cast as Gaby the wife of the murdered. She looks stately, beautiful and more than a bit spoiled. Danielle Darrieux at 85 steals a few scenes as the mother, Mamy. Isabelle Huppert makes herself into a neurotic, dotty old maid named Augustine while Emmanuelle Beart plays Louise, the sexy maid. Fanny Ardant is Pierrette, Gaby's scandalous sister-in-law. The cast takes turns doing lightweight song and dance numbers which tends to fluff out the production in a sweet fifties-ish way. In a kind of gender joke, no men appear in the movie, although we do see the back of Marcel (Gaby's husband) a couple of times. You will not be able to guess who done it, but I will not tell you why. See this for Danielle Darrieux, one the grande dames of the French cinema whose film credits go back to 1931--yes, 1931. She has a lot of fun in a juicy part 
Yes, this murder mystery is twisted and dark, but also wonderful to watch. All the characters (with the possible exception of the father) are so intriguing and bizarre...and they tend to break out into song at the drop of a hat. What a nasty family, but one can't help being sucked into their vicious yet humorous little spats and heated debates. They put the fun in the word dysfunctional, without a doubt. Beyond the wonderful characters is the beautiful scenery. True that it is primarily shot indoors, but the colors are stunningly vivid and bright. Maybe it is in contrast to the darkness of the plot, I don't know, but it is certainly a feast for the eyes. The story itself is pretty good, and not difficult to follow, but the interactions between these outstanding characters are absolutely priceless and make this movie one you should not miss. 
8 women is a good musical/ murder mystery with humor, light heartedness and mystery. It combines a bunch of the best French actrices, and an enjoyable plot. A real guesser until the end 
I absolutely loved this movie. It was so funny and light hearted. Craig Ferguson was very good. It is just a good movie to watch if you need a little uplift 
This is a delightful film. A very funny British comedy. Craig Ferguson, who wrote the script and co-stars, is one very creative guy. If you haven't seen it, check out the Late Late Show on CBS, which he now hosts. He is the funniest guy on late night tv, in my humble opinion. I've shared the Saving Grace dvd with a few friends and they have all loved it. Just sayin' 
This is a fall-off- the-couch funny film, and one you might as well buy, because you are going to watch it again and again for the silliness and comfort. For Craig Ferguson fans, it's a must -own. Tcheky Karyo fans will chortle as he pops up yet again where least anticipated. Newly widowed Grace (pertly played by Brenda Blethyn) finds her dissolute husband has left her nothing but debt; creditors and re-possessors now besiege her lovely Cornish seaside home. As she seeks solace in tending her greenhouse orchids, she ponders how to get out of the financial quagmire. For distraction she charitably tends to her feckless caretaker (Craig Ferguson)'s ailing personal-use cannabis plot, and a joint venture blooms. As Grace and Matthew modify the greenhouse, cultivate the crop, and go to market, hilarity, as they say, ensues. The villagers - all characters we wish were in our local pub - are perfection as they feign ignorance of the entire enterprise, while quietly lending unseen support to their beloved neighbor. No one is as he or she initially seems, and the various `reveals' in the subplots are charming and delightful. There is much 70's style stoner humor, but with an updated, wonderful, and uniquely British twist. Obligatory "locals inadvertently get stoned" sequences are not only original in their construction but, somehow, innocent and sweet. The ladies and the corn flakes scene is certainly one of the finest pieces of physical comedy ever put on film. And as the story progresses, it evolves from a tale of potentially puerile marijuana mishaps to, instead, one of the power of love and redemption as Grace and Matthew each find their salvation in the unfolding of a future neither of them foresaw. The ending is pure bliss, and an absolute upper. Get it. You'll be delighted. 
This movie has it all, especially for baby boomers of the early 1970's. Blethyn, as a betrayed widow is priceless and Nigel Ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks. The English scenery is charming and Blethyn's loyal village friends top off the movie's touching humor and happy ending. I have given this DVD as Christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too. A MUST OWN 
This is a truly funny movie. The main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is. This is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night. It's a good buy for your DVD collectio 
This is a must see movie for lovers of British comedy. This movie had me in stitches. In short, the plot of the movie is about a widow trying to raise money to pay off the debt her husband left her. How does she go about the task? By growing pot. Lots of laughs to be had. 
This is the very best series I've ever seen. It is addictive in the best possible way 
I LOVE everything about this movie. It has a way of showing how people will help each other, even if it means going to extremes (I don't want to give away the movie plot). It has it's laughs and tears and frustrations. It was through this movie that I discovered Craig Ferguson. I highly recommend it. It has a happy ending too 
I loved this movie right from the start. Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn are wonderful together, and some of the scenes of little old ladies geting (unknowingly) giggly on "tea" are just a hoot. I'd always liked Craig Ferguson as Mr Wick on the "The Drew Carey Show", and it's nice to see that there is so much more to him than just that character. 
What could be better than watching grizzly crimes in the sunny state and not watching the increasingly repetitive Law and Order? Not much except watching Galactica Seasons 1 and 2. Some would say that L has no lost touch and that may be true. However there is a very limited number of changes from one show to the next in terms of plot twists (like it was grandma that killed the father or it was the kid that comitted patricide). All of the crimes are gritty and realistic instead of fighting over warrants and legal mumbo jumbo. CSI Miami RULES!! 
I really did give this a chance but I can't say I like the show. It focuses more on the "police" aspect and less on the science, which differentiates the CSI series from most of the other garbage out there. I know David Caruso has his fans but I just can't appreciate him in this vehicle... 
Tightly constructed plots and likeable characters make CSI Miami my favorite of the CSI franchises. The series did not quite reach its peak until the second season, but season one is still high-quality entertainment. There is an occasional bad episode with plot holes and protagonists acting out of character, but CSI Miami is still easily one of the best crime dramas out there. Even people who do not like CSI often like CSI Miami. Those who get annoyed by the wisecracking cops, bizarre storylines, and techno-wizardry of CSI might find CSI Miami to their liking. The spinoff is more about developing the main characters and telling a fast-paced story where every plot element is resolved. If you can forgive a weak episode here and there, one too many buildings that blow up the second after Horatio runs out of them, and the fact that the writers had obviously not yet worked out all the details in season one, then check out this DVD set. I received it from my brother-in-law for Christmas and watched the whole series in a couple of weeks. Extras include several documentaries on the making of the show that will interest die-hard fans like myself 
who in the world decided david caruso was a good actor? i've never before watched such a cardboard, two dimentional, boring portrayal of a charactor in my life. 
Although the Miami series is not as good as the Las Vegas series it is still fun to watch with interesting story lines. However, I think it is kind of weird the way the coronor talks to dead people. Also David Caruso picks up on to many things that the alledged MD seems to miss all the time. Still enjoyable viewing 
I was quite the skeptic about this series from the moment I saw "Cross Jurisdictions." As an avid CSI fan, I was outraged that Anthony Zuiker and Jerry Bruckheimer were looking to turn their winning formula into a franchise, and spin it off in Law Order fashion. I believed that sure, it worked for Law Order, because each series was different than the original. Each dealt with different areas of investigation and prosecution. But to use the same crime-scene investigating formula over and over, just changing the cities around, did not appeal to me whatsoever. That was four years ago. Now, as CSI: Miami moves into its fourth season, I have become a fan. Where I once was annoyed by Horatio Caine (his penchant for removing and replacing his sunglasses as well as his constant hands-on-hips stance), I began to like his character; the gentle way in which he treated the victims, his passion for solving cases and putting the bad guys away.... not to mention his obvious chemistry with MDPD's resident "Bullet Girl" -- the lovely Southern belle, Calleigh Duquesne. The Horatio/Calleigh chemistry was what spurred me to purchase season one, and I am so far very pleased with the purchase. Other Horatio/Calleigh fans should consider buying season one, as all the great "H/C" episodes are contained therein: "Kill Zone", "Camp Fear", etc. I still don't like the way Alexx Woods speaks to the cadavers in her autopsy theater. As a future pathologist, it just makes me roll my eyes. Otherwise, this was a worthwhile purchase. I guess you could say that the skeptic has become the believer. 
I Love CSI. I didn't think there was an episode I missed over here in the UK. But having started to watch the first series last night I realised there is alot I had missed. I am really really pleased with my purchase. I would like to send a big thank you to Amazon!!! The only thing I could say is that I didn't know about the customs charge. I wish there was an option on Amazon to click on that would tell you the customs charge for the items you are going to buy. It does warn you about custom charges and to check, but I didn't as I thought DVD's would be fine. I will just have to use Amazon.co.uk from now on to avoid. But I am still thrilled!! 
This delightful Italian comedy, shows how Rosalba, an Italian hosewife, taken for granted by her family, who has lived her whole life in Pescara, Italy ... takes a vacation from them all to visit Venice, Italy. There she begins a new life with a zany group of characters who become her friends. She finds pleasure in simple everday life activities. She takes joy in spontaneously responding to the new experiences this vacation has opened for her. She meets a waiter, who provides her with a room to stay in when her funds are low.

I watched this movie on a whim and found it to be one of the best I've seen. The story is great, I love the characters, I loved the ending. I was glad that the people in it looked "real", unlike Hollywood movies. Other reviews go into detail on the plot details. I will say no more than I love this movie people I have loaned it to have loved it also, with very few exceptions. Just expect the dialog to be in Italian, though this makes no difference in the quality of the acting or the story 
I admit it. I love a sappy movie, the more Kleenex's the better. I was not disappointed with this one. This is the kind of movie that just calls for buying a few bottles of good wine, some great cheese and fruit and some crusty Italian bread, and inviting over some good friends. I admit I was a bit put off when I realized it was subtitled in English but spoken in Italian, but it didn't take long to get used to the subtitles, and the Italian language playing in the background of my reading only added to the feeling of the movie, not detracted from it. If you are at that age when it feels like life is one big rut, and you long to do something wild and adventurous, then you can live out your fantasy in this movie. The other reviews will fill you in on what the movie is about. All I can tell you is I watched this one and immediately ordered it to add to my collection, right between Falling in Love with Meryl Streep, Bridges of Madison County, Pay it Forward, and Shirley Valentine. Get it. Unless you are a husband who can't figure out why women act so loco around fifty, you'll love it 
I loved this sweet movie about a housewife who is so taken for granted that her family accidentally leaves her at a rest stop in Italy. The lady, Rosalba, goes on her own vacation to Venice and, among a lovely group of people (a lonely Icelandic waiter beautifully portrayed, an eccentric holistic masseuse, a sweet muddling plumber/detective, an anachist flowershop owner), rediscovers her passion for the accordian, life and the importance of not being distracted from what is of lasting value. 
This light romantic comedy could be described as a chick flick for those a bit older and wiser than the target audience for most current Hollywood movies in this genre. Like its predecessor "Shirley Valentine," it follows a married woman as she escapes a housewife's life and finds another more to her liking. So marginal in her own family that she gets left behind at a tour bus stop, and acting on a combination of impulses, she takes a vacation on her own in that most romantic of cities, Venice, and meets there (among a comical assortment of characters) a man who steals her heart. The leisurely pace of the story and the gently comic humor are just right. Difficulties are eventually resolved without great effort, sometimes in unpredictable ways, and you relax into a feel-good world where kindred spirits meet and live happily ever after. Goes well with a bottle of Italian wine - shared, of course 
I continue to be astounded at how carelessly Amazon reviewers throw around their 5 star ratings. This movie is overlong and not especially comedic or romantic. The main character (or the actress who plays her anyway) is appealing, but her motivations to start a new life aren't convincing or justified. Her "romance" with the waiter is ludicrous and the ending is contrived and predictable. It actually took me 3 days to see the ending because I just didn't have the patience to view this from beginning to end in one sitting. IF you are a patient, die-hard romantic with 2 hours to kill, I guess you might enjoy it. I am not and I did not 
This is a beautifully unpretentious Italian romantic comedy with some strong performances from a cast that includes one of my favorite actors, Bruno Ganz. Ganz plays Maigret in the recent Franco-German TV series which was such a hit on the continent and which needs to be seen in the USA. For me, this movie had even more charm than the recent crop of good English romantic comedies such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, About A Boy and others (all of which seem to star Hugh Grant and an English repertory cast). If you found their mixture of reality and comic fantasy attractive, you'll love this movie, too. Although my Italian isn't profound, I didn't have any trouble with the subtitles. It remains to be seen if the American remake can capture this light-hearted movie's tone 
A quirky story of a woman in an unsatisfying relationship who takes a vacation from her middle-class family and finds working class love. It's sweet without being syrupy and full of odd characters who add extra fun 
I liked but didn't love the first two MI films. The first was artsy but somewhat convoluted and not well-paced. The second was exciting to the extreme, but bloated, pretentious (e.g. the signature John Woo doves) and lacking any sort of subtlety, as we've seen in other Woo films (e.g. Face/Off). MI:3 feels completely different than its predecessors, thanks to the writing and directing of JJ Abrahms, the creator of "Alias" and "Lost." You can see his style all over this film. The best way to describe MI:3 is this: The first half is like a really, really good episode of "Alias," but with a $50 million budget. The second half is like a really, really good episode of "24", but with a $50 million budget. If you like both of these exciting TV shows, I am pretty sure you will like MI:3 a lot. I know Tom Cruise has lost of lot of folks' goodwill, with the couch-jumping hysterics, his totally out-of-line comments about Brooke Shields' post partum depression, and other high profile screw-ups. It would be totally understandable if you didn't want to bother with his films anymore. But I respectfully ask you to cut him a little slack, just for 120 minutes, just long enough to enjoy this film. It's worth it, trust me! 
This first disc on all editions of this movie on DVD includes a making-of featurette that should more than please the casual fan of the film. The second disc, exclusive to the Special Edition, goes deeper into just about every aspect of the production, I just wish they'd lower the amount of mutual "pats in the back" and "Tom does all his stunts" a bit. I guess my favorite "Mission" would be the first but all of them have great things going on for them. As action films go, they really belong at the top of the crop. the best thing going on for MI3 is Ethan Hunt's supporting team which for once work together the way they used to in the old series. I have a hard time understanding the cold shoulder audiences have given Tom Cruise over his couch-jumping thing, sure, it's hard getting excited about a Hollywood star wanting to marry for the third time but as celebrities go nowadays, it's not even worth mentioning it. This reminds me the time when James Cameron joked about being "king of the world" after winning an Oscar and people becoming bitter towards him. I guess some people don't like to see others being too happy with their lives. If Cruise follows some religion which to some of us sounds more than a bit loony, at least he hasn't done anything to attack mine like all those involved in the Da Vinci Code. At any rate, don't let the mediocre box office results of MI3 discourage you from watching it. You can see a real effort to make an outstanding film in every scene 
The great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes.The plot is easy to follow and all is the action and I think JJ abrams did a great job as director.This dvd is worth looking 
Considering all the bad press Tom Cruise and this film got earlier this year I wasn't expecting this film to be all that great. I mean, by the time you get to the third sequel of film there is rarely anything original left. Granted, this film is not the most original of plots, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, what a great job J. J. Abrams did, and what a great cast the film had. It was much better than I expected it would be. As you watch the film, you can definitely see J. J.'s "Alias" touches all over the place. There were even a few times when I wondered if Sydney Bristow was going to jump, which would have been SO cool. Tom Cruise too a lot of crap for this film, whether that was deserved or not due to some of his antics I don't know, but he was very good in the film and it keeps you attention from start to finish. If you're looking for a great action film that is also beautifully filmed and well acted, M:I3 is your film 
Tom Cruise's third (and his last) Mission is an action thriller that works on so many levels. It works since J.J. Abrahams directed this like man version of Alias. It works as part of the Mission Impossible film trilogy&lt; It works as a taut action adventure thriller. It works as a vehicle for Tom Cruise. It is not your father's Mission Impossible...it starts at a point towards the end and works back. The amazing thing you are drawn into this complex piece. The puzzle that this movie is sometimes gets overwheming there are a few missteps in the action and the ploting, However Cruise and compant shines in this twist and turn script with so many red herings. I will say Phillip Seymore Hoffman is a calm bad guy which works against Cruise's hot and cold action man. Ving Rhames is so under used in MI3. Michelle Monaghan is a star who shined as Cruise's love interest. it is a good action flick for those who crave action Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD 
This is, as most critics agreed, the best of the trilogy. Abrams' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish, including a few twists along the way. I was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film. The only thing I DIDN'T like.... the short pause in the middle of the film, probably for a change between the dual layers. VERY annoying! 
It had one of the stupidest music scores that I havd heard in a while. Sounded like something reserved for a B-Movie. But thankfully, this only lasted during the second action scene: The assualt on the wharehouse. The rest of the movie was awesome. A 5-star movie with a 1-star music score that seemed quite adolescent. Anyway 4 shining stars 
I first found out Hannah Montana when I realised I saw Billy Ray Cyrus, thinking it was someone else at first. Thank goodness I was wrong!!! I am quite older than being 13, (almost 30) but I loved Billy Ray Cyrus when he first came out in early 1990's, and still do. Now that his daughter Miley has her own show and an awesome voice, I not only do I get to see and hear him again, but also his own daughter following a similar career as he has. I knew I had to buy the dvd, not question there. It's a piece of my past, when I was a teen, but it's a great way to remind myself that life is not always about work. It tells me to be a kid at heart, and laugh every now and then!! 
I absolutely love this show. I'm probably a little older than their target audience (I'm 23) but I can't get enough of this show. Miley is cute -she has the cutest facial expressions, and there's something about her that just makes her so fun to warch. She isn't the best actress or the best singer in the world -she's young and can only get better though; and still I just can't wait for the next new episode. The show is funny in a way that sort of reminds of I Love Lucy; the way she always gets herself into situations and tries to get out of them in the funniest way. Like why didn't she tell the boy in "I can't make you love hannah if you don't" that she couldn't go to the Hannah Montana concert with him instead of trying to do the flinstones and be in two places at once? Not to mention rapping for him? doh di doh di doh. :) The songs are good too.. upbeat and I think they all have a good message. Parents might like that. They might also like the fact that family is an important aspect of Hannah Montana. Her father is also her manager and is like a best friend to Miley, and her relationship with her brother is like any other loving relationship between a brother and sister. -meaning they fight alot but are there for each other when it matters. I also love the fact that Miley does get the best of both worlds 
Can't actually review this yet since it is on pre-order but I can say that we enjoy the show. I am the mom, and I find the show is entertaining, one of the best on Disney Channel. Nothing objectionable ever, and the actors are well cast and work wonderfully together. We just saw Miley Cyrus as Hannah Montana in concert with Everlife and the Cheetah Girls, it was the last show for Hannah Montana to be on this tour, and Miley's show was excellent. She is amazingly professional at such a young age, and has a lot of charisma and talent. We will be purchasing this DVD, and we already have the soundtrack with bonus video dvd on pre-order. YES at 91 minutes it IS POSSIBLE to have up to 4 episodes and still have room for a short interview and bonus footage. I know because I studied TV production though I chose to work in another field after college. The Hannah Montana episodes are shown during a 1/2 hour time slot, however when you deduct the opening and closing scenes and all of the commercials, you are left with about 18 minutes of actual show. Even if there are 3 episodes plus the bonus episode, that is only 72 minutes, leaving almost 20 minutes for the interview and bonus footage. 
I love this show I have seen every episode so many times now when I watch it I say all the lines with them. The bonus episode will most likely be Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free (which I have already seen 6 times, I downloaded it) I can't wait for this to come out I already have the game, and have been to 2 of her concerts, so I am going to be first in line with both the CD and DVD. For thoes who don't already know there will be 3 episodes + the bonus one. This is my favorite show, and if you haven't seen it yet you should watch it, or if you think it won't be good at least give it a chance. ~Sophi 
Being a big fan of horror and scray movies I consider this movie to be a success. As it succeeded in doing what it intended, it scared the crap out of me. I would say it is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen, those Japanese sure know how to scare people. The storyline is actually quite good too, and while the acting isn't quite inspirational, it is quite good by all involved. The movie making is of a high quality and all up, this is a very good movie, well worth buying and watching over again 
This was not very good, in my opinion. The Ring scared the bejeezus outta me. This was not scary. Two weeks afterwards, I still find my mind wandering about one thing...why the heck didn't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room? If I walk into my house and see a half-naked boy meowing and hissing at me, I'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin 
Since "Ringu" Japanese horror movies are all the rage here in the US, but mind you, not all of them are actually any good, and what works for Japanese audiences does not necessarily translate well to American moviegoers. For that reason Hollywood studios occasionally remake Japanese horror hits to give them a Western feel, as was the case with "The Ring." The same happened with "The Grudge," a movie whose original played very well in Japan. Unlike "The Ring" which hwas completely westernized, with "The Grudge" Columbia Pictures took a more restrained route. Hiring the same director who created the original film, leaving its location in Tokyo with a cast consisting mostly of Japanese actors, the filmmakers added only a few Hollywood actors to create an American feel. I was curious to find out if they succeeded as well as "The Ring" did. I found "The Grudge" to be an thoroughly enjoyable and tense film hat kept me on the edge throughout. The sinister undertones of the film, the sound effects, the strong visuals and of course the stingers, all make for a first rate horror film, much better than most of Hollywood's fare of recent years, though you have to be open to the somewhat different Eastern sensibilities the film plays upon. 
The Grudge is the American remake of the Japanese horror film. What's different about The Grudge is it's non-linear story line. At first you think it's three separate stories, then just two, and finally you realize that your seeing interspersed storylines from the past and from the present and they meet at the end of the film -- filling you in on the curse and what's happening. (Think Momento and Identity) The scariest part of the story, and it is pretty creepy, is that because of the curse born with the first murder kills indescriminately anyone who enters the house. Not immediately. Not in the same way. No matter what you do, you can't outwit it. If you were in the house, it's got your number. The scariest thing is most of the people involved were innocent -- they had nothing to do with the original killing, when seeing the ghost while shocked, they tried to help. Yet, still they died. There might have been a way to avoid the curse but unfortunately, it didn't get carried out. There's no CGI/FX -- everything is low key and creepy. I'd almost say this is more psychological horror than monster coming to get you horror but never they less -- you'll probably end up sleeping with the lights on and wondering if you should evere go into a house you don't know anything about again 
According to The Grudge, there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. It's a "stain" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred, and it will kill everything it touches. All I can say is if that were true then the movie-going public better hope I never die in a theater. The audience at this movie was probably the most obnoxious crowd I've ever had the displeasure of watching a movie with. Talk about being in a powerful grip of rage. More on that later. Jump scenes rule the day here. That's right, this baby is stocked with jump scenes! If you're having a hard time deciphering my complicated terminology, then let me explain that a "jump scene" is one in which something startling happens to catch you off guard and makes you jump in your seat. Some people think jump scenes are cheap ploys to get a scare from the audience, but they're really well done in this movie. And they're manufactured frequently and shrewdly enough to keep you in a constant state of unease. Unfortunately, when most moviegoers get scared they like to scream and then laugh and talk about it for 2 minutes afterwards. If you're gonna scream then scream. But then SHUT UP and WATCH THE MOVIE! This ain't a comedy and it certainly isn't a coffeehouse, so quit killin' my atmosphere. Some of you might be a little agitated to know that The Grudge does follow some clichï¿½d horror movie conventions, such as a character investigating a creepy noise in a dark attic with only a cigarette lighter to illuminate the way. And of course, one character has to slowly follow a strange figure that shouldn't be there in the first place. But it's forgivable. Keep in mind, characters aren't necessarily supposed to know they're in a horror movie. I'm sure we've all explored strange noises before, except rather than a horrific, disfigured ghost producing the noise, in real life the sound is usually coming from Uncle Larry's bathroom excursion. Never underestimate the horror of a night out at the Taco Bell. Comparisons to The Ring are inevitable, so I'll just say that I personally feel The Grudge is the creepier of the two. This is a movie that's heavy on atmosphere and freaky imagery. The Japanese ghosts creeped me out even more than the time I caught some pervert staring at me in the men's bathroom stall back in my college days. Lucky for him, he took off before I had a chance to demonstrate what happens when a person is caught in a powerful grip of rage. But The Ring has the better story and a much better ending. The Grudge does a great job of keeping you guessing. You never really know where it's going, and since the story isn't linear you really have to pay attention. I know a lot of you have the attention span of a goldfish (about 9 seconds, you just learned something today, thank me later), so this may be problematic. I think it works fairly well, but one of my complaints is that near the end everything is wrapped up and explained rather quickly. As a result, I wish the movie had been longer. A longer running time could've produced more in-depth character development, a more clever way to explain what was going on, and maybe even a better ending. And there's my biggest complaint. Why do so many horror movies feel the need to use the I Know What You Did Last Summer-esque "look, there's gonna be a sequel" ending? Come on, how about some closure? It's similar to if you're waiting for me to close out my review in a witty and funny fashion, but instead, for some reason I just decide to end the review in mid sent... THE GIST If you're looking for some Halloween entertainment, then The Grudge will give you some good jumps and surround you with creepy imagery. But I strongly recommend that you see it at a time when there won't be a big crowd because I know I would've enjoyed the movie a lot more had I not been surrounded by a lot of stand-up comedians who felt the need to crack jokes at the most tense and inopportune times. Folks, this is a horror movie. Tension and atmosphere are a big part of it... I look forward to watching the DVD in peace and quiet one day where the only idiots I'll possibly be surrounded by will be friends and family. Rating: 4 (out of 5) 
WOW. That's the only thing I can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews. I admit, the very first time I watched the Grudge with my father NEITHER of us thought the movie was scary at all and couldn't understand its success, but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night I REALLY began to see how frightening the movie is. Probably contains the same amount of fear as the original Exorcist, another movie that's really effectively well done. You HAVE to watch the Exorcist and the Grudge at night to get the proper effect. The Grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story. I say "pretty interesting" because the storyline isn't the best, or the easiest to understand. Just interesting enough to get the job done. The Grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little. In fact, this is probably its strongest point. Every time something scary happens, you see just a "little bit" of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect, which is *very* important if you want to effectively scare someone. If the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn't have scared me nearly as much because I would have gotten used to seeing it. The boy appears, and then he's gone. Not giving away too much REALLY works with this movie. You see, to really scare me you simply CAN'T put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you HAVE to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable. The Grudge works *extremely* well it this area. The fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the Grudge allows me to give the film another compliment. I'm telling you, the scene with the woman inside that building by herself (well, except for a security guard) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone-chilling excitement. I *loved* this scene. I was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her. The scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was *awesome*, and the scene a few moments after this happened where she DID see something in the shadow was ANOTHER awesome display of bone-chilling brilliance. There's a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie. Freakin' AWESOME! Excellent pacing and suspense makes the Grudge a true horror classic, in my opinion. I've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and I'd easily put the Grudge right up there as one of the best. People today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary. Remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the Exorcist was the scariest movie of all-time? I wish everyone agreed that the Grudge is a total classic, and that the Ring is another excellent one. 
Don't believe the hype. This movie sucks. Nothing happened. The ghost of a boy and a lady showed up every now and then,then the movie ended. I'm not one to usually complain about or laugh at cheap effects. I actually think that the so called low buget 1980s movies look a lot more realistic than todays CGI. But I just had to laugh at the sound that the ghosts made. I imediately reconized it as a sound I used to make with my mouth all the time as a wee lad 
well, this movie was typical. over the passed few years the fast and the furious films have seemed to do a decent job giving an insider look to the current up to date car enthusiast scene. however, sometimes it is very unrealistic. i'm assuming for the sake of action. people seem to forget that it's just a movie. the action scenes are indeed far fetched, but they make the movie watchable. i don't know a TON about cars, so i can't really say if the movie was accuaretly displayed there or not. the plot was dry, like the other 2 of the series, but how exciting of a plot can you have with the amount of action and skilled driving packed into the movie. acting wise i was slightly over impressed. i could have done with another main character, though he did put me in the mind of a young paul walker. i could have done without zachary ty bryan in the beginning. maybe that's just because the only other place i've seen him is home improvement. besides it being unrealstic, yet action packed. i have came to the conclusion that if you are into cars, it's worth a watch. i wouldn't recommend BUYING it, but renting it would be worth it. 4 stars 
It really doesn't matter too much that almost every scene in this film is so far beyond believable, for this is not a movie that's designed to make sense...it's designed to keep the audience in its seats, and in that sense this movie soars. Like the two films that proceeded it, `The Fast and the Furious - Tokyo Drift' is a high octane rollercoaster ride littered with fast cars and fast women, and for its target audience (teenage boys) it hits every mark just right. Now I am a huge fan of the first film, and a minor fan of the second. I had absolutely no expectations for this film (I thought that the previews looked lame, and no one from either of the previous films was making an appearance, well, Vin is in the last 30 seconds but that doesn't count) so when I watched it I was increasingly impressed with how much I was enjoying myself. I'll point out first off that I was much relieved to see that Zachery Ty Bryan was only in the first few minutes of the film and that his character was not explored throughout the film...I can't stand him. That aside, Lucus Black (Friday Night Lights Jarhead) does a great job here as Sean. Lucus is a much better actor than the overrated Paul Walker (sure, he's got great abs but his acting ability is below B-Grade) and actually made his character interesting. Sung Kang was also very good as Han and Brian Tee was believable in all his irritating bad-boyness as DK. Bow Wow takes the place of Ludacris and Ja Rule before him as the rapper-guy side kick, and he does an alright job, but he just doesn't really fit here (Luda was by far the best of the three). Nathalie Kelly plays Neela, the girl Sean is fighting for, and she is amply hot enough to vie for attention. Sure the plot of weak and the relationships are unbelievable, I mean who can honestly say that they feel a kingpin to the Japanese/Chinese/Oriental (whatever it was) Mafia is going to agree to have his nephew and some stranger race to squash their beef? But, like I said, it doesn't have to make sense, it doesn't have to be believable. `The Fast and the Furious' franchise have done quite well for themselves giving the growing young boys of the world exactly what they want, sleek fast cars coupled with hot young tail 
The third installment of the movie line based on high performance cars woven into a world of corruption and crime shines compared to the first two. Perhaps the reason I liked this one so much better that the story has a little more depth, a little less cheese, and isn't quite so focused on the actual street races that take place. "The fast and the furious: Tokyo Drift" takes us into the world of street racing once again, but instead of beating us over the head with this overblown sub-culture (c'mon, the last thing I have respect for is some kid who is obviously spoiled as he does not work yet has tens of thousands of dollars to dump into a Honda car so it can have a bunch of accessories that themselves, are overpriced) it concentrates more on the Japanese culture and how out of place the lead character Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is when he arrives there. The movie also does a good job of keeping it simple by introducing the "drift" technique as opposed to showing wanna-be adrenaline junkies on some suddenly empty street in So-Cal trying to see who can beat whom to the finish line. Sean is a high school aged kid with a history of incidents involving illegal car racing. After a final crash, he goes to live with his father in Tokyo who is stationed there with the Navy. Despite putting strict rules on him, it's quickly becoming obvious that you can't stop Sean from racing, which usually is started over some mouthy competition over a girl. Sean soon finds himself over his head as he crosses paths with a man who is the "king of drift" (Brian Tee as D.K.). He also finds out these are not Americana dirt roads that have some gravel for leeway, and ultimately makes a fool of himself at his initial race while desperately trying to figure out the timing and skill it takes to cause the car to drift (essentially getting it into a partial spin by adjusting the brakes viciously and the gas liberally). This installment of the "Fast and Furious" series is again, much more believable than the first two. Gone is the supreme bravado and empty glamour from wanna-be bad boys. Its replaced with a better plot and tight script that is not over the top but still suspenseful at every turn. Brian soon finds himself in over his head as D.K.'s girl is someone he finds that he cares about, but by then he's in deep working with one of D.K.'s associates, who is ultimately going to get everyone in a ton of trouble. I've never liked low riders, let alone the phenomenon that seems to surround the modern day racers. For that, I was happy to see a good old American muscle car come into play in the movie, showing the boys what real cars used to be made of. The racing scenes at night along the winding cliff roads are marvelous and have a good cinematic appeal to them, as well as some of the more drab, parking garage stunts which always give an appealing crash here and there. After a multitude of lawsuits after amateurs (lets face it, if you want to start talking real racers, look up A.J. Foyt or Emerson Fittipaldi) were actually trying to reproduce the rush they got from watching this stuff (and killing dozens of innocent people in the process) I was surprised they were even able to come out with another installment. A guest star that was present on the original will make an appearance at the end of the movie, only to my disappointment. Tokyo Drift works because this time they actually worked a little on the storyline and surrounding sub-plots instead of throwing Vin Diesel tough guy quotes at us for 2 hours. Lucas Black does a great job with some humor as he plays the part of "Southern Country boy gone to Tokyo" quite well 
While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie. This movie was just plain stupid. They should have kept this film story in the states. Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time. I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan. So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students? Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do? Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment? I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese. Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet. The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful. Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here. Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture. Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students. There would be nothing further from the truth. Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here. Not by a long shot. Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant. The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states. 
After buying the original "The Fast and The Furious" I found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it. However, I can now say I am a fan of the trilogy (all 3 films are good). Lucas Black is simply The Man and gives another great performance here. Bow Wow does a surprisingly good job as well. Car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie (which I am neither). This is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy 
The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is about a 17 year old kid named Sean played by Lucas Black. Sean loves cars and he loves to race them but it's too bad he can't get away from the police like Brian O'conner (Paul Walker) because he's already been caught twice and is on his way to a third strike. Sean ends up wrecking his car in a race against a high school jock who was racing to keep his girlfriend. Sean gets caught and instead of going to jail he goes to Tokyo to live with his father. What you have here in Tokyo Drift is a new beginning for The Fast and The Furious series. Vin Diesel is no Oscar winning actor but he made The Fast and the Furious good, you can't lie and say it doesn't need him. Since Diesel won't come back and even with help Paul Walker can't give the film what it needs why not change everything but still keep the idea of being Fast and Furious. The film seems to be trying to start something new just like the original film being the first of its kind. The only material I've been able to view Japanese drifting is in the anime Initial D and this film. Both show different views on the style of the people who drift in Japan. One similar thing is that everybody's cocky and sure of their skills and everyone lives and breathes drifting. I have to tell the truth because I truly think this film is up there with the first one, I'm not saying it's better but this nicely done and has an original story just like the first film. Although the cast may sound weak I had a little faith in Lucas Black and little faith in Bow Wow. Bow Wow is actually a talented actor and does a nice job supporting Lucas. One thing I hated was that the writers just had to add the hot girl that is in the middle of two guys. She has to choose between the guy she is supposed to love because his family saved her life and the new guy she's supposed to hate because he's an American. You think that people would get tired of that stuff by now, when will someone surprise me with something different. In the first Fast and the Furious it was Brian chasing Toretto's sister, in the second Brian was chasing Monica (Eva Mendes), and now you have Sean who's chasing Neela. I have plenty of positive things to say about this film. I really liked this story even though it was getting too close to being another one of those teen movies. I love the drifting and the way it was filmed; I had doubts about the whole drifting idea. I thought drifting would be fun to do but boring to watch and I was wrong because it was hot. The slowed down scenes to show just how close these cars come to hitting the wall and spinning out of control is amazing. What I loved most about this third film is that there is a perfect blend of action throughout the film. There's not too much talking and not enough action or too much action and not enough of a story. The city was beautiful, lots of lights, cool buildings, and plenty of color. The characters are all written well and actually have deep stories. There's not as much NOS used and not as much speed as the first two movies but this movie is still very exciting. I don't think I can stress enough on how great the drifting is and how beautiful the cars are. Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is entertaining and hopefully there will be more from the series like this one 
I mean, nothing made sense in this movie and it literally made my head spin. Nothing but fast cars, severly underweight h00chies, and plenty of rock/hip music. It was like watching an extremely long music video. Sean is supposed to be in high school, but as old as he looked I guess he was on the 10 year plan. On top of that, he talked like Forrest Gump. In order not to go to jail, Sean moves to Japan to live with his dad. Sean was able to find himself a crew real quick. And if he and his friends were suppposedly in high school, how come they had so much time to race, fix cars, and go to parties? Shouldn't they have been studying for entrance crams? If it wasn't for Bow Wow and Vin Diesel (small part at the end), I never would've watched this waste of a film

X-Men, X-Men United and X-Men "The Last Stand" are simply spectacular! The cast,the characters, the special effects, the story, the action scenes,and everyhting else seems to work to make these movies the best movie trilogy ever!!!.I have seen lots of movies in my life, but nothing compares and comes close to X-Men. 
In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a "cure" is found that makes all mutants human. Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such is the view of the mutant self-proclaimed leader Magneto. In the final chapter, Magneto fears that the "cure" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way. All three movies are suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in these films. New mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in X3). Special effects are 5-stars. If you've not seen any of the movies (or all of the movies) in the trilogy, this 3-pack is a great opportunity to see a classic tale in chronological order and own a classic 3-part tale in the genre that belongs in any sci-fi fan's collection. Hugh Jackman is excellent in the tough-guy roll as Wolverine (we like you better as a tough guy, Hugh); Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) are all spot-on too. And Famke Janssen is Phoenix whose character is key to the trilogy. Beast is in X3 too, actually played by (to my surprise in the rolling credits)...Kelsey Grammer! Now there's a real mutation! All in all a very entertaining 6 hours of movies here. X fans won't miss these, and you shouldn't either if you're into the action, sci-fi or fantasy genres. 
While it'd be impossible for any films to do justice to Marvel's legendary team of super-powered mutants, I really feel that these films are almost as good an adaptation as we could have hoped for. The casting was strong, the action was solid, most of the characters were portrayed memorably, and the stories largely stayed true to the spirit of the X-men. The first film felt a little rushed due to the sheer number of characters introduced, but all things considered it was a very enjoyable film for both the uninitiated and old-school X-fans. Hugh Jackman was spot-on as Wolverine, the most iconic X-man and arguably the hardest to cast and Famke Jansen was a fantastic Jean Grey for at least the first two films. Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellan (Magneto), and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique) also delivered outstanding performances playing their respective comic icons. The story was a nice update of the comics and followed Rogue's induction into Professor X's school for mutants and Magneto's first big terrorist attack on mankind. All-in-all, a satisfying start to the series. The second film really kicked the series into gear and introduced more of our favorite X-men, including Nightcrawler (whose opening sequence was the highlight of the film), Pyro, and Iceman. The story involves Wolverine's past and the government's attempts to control the ever-growing mutant population. The result was one of the greatest comic book films ever made that firmly cemented the developing series as one to watch. For some ridiculous reason, at this point the powers that be decided that the third film would be the last. This was a bad choice that made no kind of sense, upset the films' fans, and severly hurt the quality of the third film. Ah, the third film; a mixed bag to say the least. The plot deals with two classic storylines involving a cure for mutants and the legendary Dark Phoenix. My personal list of complaints is a long one, but I'll just hit a few in this review. "X-men: The Last Stand" tries to cram two movies' worth of material into one film that is too short to begin with. The introduction of the Phoenix was obviously forced and no care was taken in this storyline which is one of the all-time classics in comic history, and the result is several pointless character deaths and gaps in logic, like why an all-powerful entity is content to hang out at an aging terrorist's side and just look menacing for most of the story. The series' former darling, Rogue, is reduced to a brooding plot-nuisance, has no real influence on the story, plus she never gains the fantastic powers she obtained in the comics that made her such a powerhouse of a character and a personal favorite of mine. On the other hand, more classic characters are given parts such as fan-favorite Kitty Pride and Collossus (both of which had cameos in X2), Angel, Multiple Man, Beast (played nicely by Kelsey Grammer), and the almighty Juggernaut (whose battle with Kitty was as awesome as it was unexpected). But as many characters as there were that made it into the three films, there were so many great ones that were reduced to either tiny, unnamed cameos in the series, or forgotten altogether. No Gambit, Emma Frost, Sinister, Apocalypse, Scarlet Witch, or Havok to name just a few. Furthermore, the final film's resolution in extremely unsatisfying and leaves little doubt that this franchise as we know it is dead, though they do leave us a glimmer of hope. There are talks of Wolverine and Magneto spin-offs and possibly a New Mutants project; promising ideas, but hardly a substitute for the ensemble we know and love. Still, in the end, I really did enjoy X3 as a film as it did have several great stand-up-and-cheer moments; it just upset me as a fan of the comics and as a fan of the the movies because there wss so much more that could have and should have been done with this series. In the end, whether you're a fan of the comics, the cartoons, or just a fan of sci-fi or fun movies in general, you really shouldn't miss out on these three movies. The series is full of memorable characters, fantastic battles, sly humor, references for hard-core fans, and, of course, the classic X-men social commentaries about discrimination and the importance of both individuality and cohesiveness. There doesn't appear to be much in the way of special features from the first two films on this edition; but for about $10 a flick, I'll let it slide since it is still a hell of a bargain. Highly recommended set 
X3's action was bland at best. The choreography was horrible and Ratner didn't shoot it well at all (the entire movie included). The pacing / editing was horrible, characters were killed off and not given justice (nor onscreen deaths in one instance...a real sin), and the story was rediculous. The 1st two movies would be the only reason to buy this box set, the 3rd was a disappointing P.O.S. that was rushed just so Fox could make their money. Had they waited and let Bryan Singer direct and gotten good writers such as David Hayter (who wrote the screenplay for the previous 2 X-Men movies), then X3 had plenty of potential to end on a solid note and conclude what was IMO the best superhero movies. The worst part of X3 was the fact that they couldn't follow simple continuity set up by the 1st two, it was honestly rediculous to see onscreen. You're better off just buying the 1st two dvds in their 2 pack, X3 is barely worth the disappointing view 
All the X-men Movies are good on their own, i would take a half point of the thrid becuse Brian singer didn't finish his trilogy. But The last movie served as a great place to showcase Wolverine and i see it as a great little action Flick so i give it the five stars sit back and enjoy 
I saw this movie twice, the second time knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives. Explains why we are where we are, and makes you part of the harmony. Is love as simple as teaching someone to bike? Think about it. If there are no rules against it, this film should be renominated for Oscar. 
This is a beautiful film that makes you cry and laugh and at the same time. Although one could critisize that it uses certain klischees and stereotypes we all know that if you open your heart things like that can and do actually happen in "real" life. Overall very inspiring, I love this film! P.S. Bless all who resist it's magic... ; 
This is definetly one of the best movies of all times. No effects, no show, just the opening of souls and minds of normal people. The music is is just a perfect frame for a perfect picture 
This is the first movie I've been to where at the end I wanted to stand and applaud. I think the sound of the choir at the end had such an overwhelming physical affect I was physically and emotionally moved. I felt as if all my cells were hopping. After I saw this film I heard a physician on public radio talking about 'sound therapy' and the ways in which music, song and sound can heal the body. 
This review focuses on various human-emotion topics of the film rather than details of the storyline: I sobbed from a spiritual/soul epiphany sparked by this film. Films like this that dig beneath the surface of human experience are once in a blue moon. It demonstrates a sincere belief in the good of people- it speaks the message again and again that one's best is all anyone can ever do. It serves to humanize all members of a society, regardless of their actions (referring to battered woman and husband). It is a story of a group of individuals learning to listen to one another and harmonize- the choir is a metaphor for the grander society; an indispensable lesson for the well-being of our world. It is about release of judgment and fears. A beautiful film! If you enjoyed Life is Beautiful (Roberto Benini) or Together(another Swedish film)- you may really like As It Is In Heaven 
I saw this movie at a relative's house in Sweden and loved it. Very funny and fantastic music. Wonderful to see northern Sweden and a choir develop like that. Nominated for the foreign language film Oscar a year ago or so. Whenever it becomes available in the US, getting it. Worth seeing. Transfer this film to US format fast 
First of all, it is important to understand that we never went to the moon. The Apollo project was a hoax. I won't try to prove anything to you in this review, but I will recommend the documentary film, Astronauts Gone Wild. In the film, the film-maker confronts eight of the living astronauts who claim to have traveled to the moon. It is clear from their reactions (especially Buzz Aldrin's) that they did not go to the moon. Buzz Aldrin comes very close (in my opinion) to actually admitting that it was a hoax. Judge for yourself. I am giving this mini-series (From the Earth to the Moon) a five star rating because it confirms without question in my mind that we never went to the moon. So it is a must see for anyone who is looking into the Apollo Hoax. Don't get me wrong. This is a very boring mini-series. So far, I've only watched the first three episodes (disc 1). I literally fell asleep during all three episodes. So it took me about a week to watch them. But this mini-series is important because it brings up important questions. Here are a few questions that come to mind: Who in Hollywood knows that the Apollo project was a hoax? Is Tom Hanks a criminal for making this film, or is he just another person who has been fooled into believing that we really went to the moon? Is executive producer Ron Howard a criminal? Who should be investigated? Who should be arrested? In light of the fact that the Apollo project was a hoax, it is reasonable to guess that the crew of Apollo 1 (Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee) were murdered. They were probably murdered because they knew first-hand how absurd the idea of making it to the moon within the decade was. They were, most likely, being silenced. This is a reasonable theory. Episode 2 in this mini-series deals with Apollo 1. After watching this episode, I am convinced that those Apollo 1 astronauts were murdered, and this film is intentionally trying to cover up the murders. So the big question (if this theory is correct) is: Who (in the production of this film) needs to be investigated and arrested for trying to cover up the murders of three astronauts 
I too have both the original and this 'signature' editions of this great production, so I did the comparison test. There is indeed vertical loss of picture in this "widescreen" version. It's been cropped. The picture quality still remains quite good however. The fact I have both versions should tell you how highly I regard this show. Even though the episode on Apollo 13 is quite lame, this series remains a remarkable achievement, the very best thing to come out of Hollywood in many long years. But if there is indeed a true 16:9 version, this isn't it. More marketing hype 
In previous reviews the aspect ratio of this DVD set is often mentioned. I have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong. It may be true that the series was shot in 16:9 and I remember seeing it that way on Belgium TV, but this is not that version! When watching these DVDs it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong: the top of people's heads are frequently cut off, sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible. I also own the Dutch DVD-set of this great series which has 4:3 aspect ratio, no extras but very cheap, less than $10,00. Comparison showed that the Signature Editon used the 4:3 version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a 16:9 version. Again, if the series was originally shot in 16:9 than this is not that version! Shame on you HBO for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called Special Edition 
I watched and loved the series when it originally came out on VHS. A chance to meet Neil Armstrong and John Glenn this year prompted me to take another look. I consider this work the best mini-series of all time, which is perhaps biased, as I have read extensively about the space program and have been a big fan since attending a ticker-tape parade for John Glenn as a young boy. Both fans of the Apollo program and general movie watchers who enjoy human drama and have even a speck of interest in the historical aspects of Apollo should be well satisfied. Tom Hanks pulled together an exceptional work, as his team hit the highlights and the details at key moments, with enough other offbeat and background moments to add to the entertainment (one that comes to mind is Pete Conrad's instructions to his team to do their business before they headed in for the lunar landing). The score fits well, and the occasional pop number reminds the viewer how (unfortunately) long ago these events were. Given that Apollo 11 is only around the midpoint of the series, Hanks was up to the challenge of maintaining momentum after the early climax. Focus shifted from the flights themselves to alternative themes. Apollo 12 highlighted the free-spirited Pete Conrad and the luckiest moonwalker of them all, Al Bean. Apollo 13 obviously could not re-do the movie that was relatively new at the time, and remains popular. The summary was reasonable, with the emphasis on the career conflict among the newsmen just OK, and probably the weakest of all the segments. Apollo 14 had the return of Al Shepard, and 15's episode was a solid detour into the rise of scientific objectives and the change in astronauts' thinking. Once again the astronauts showed their exceptional talents, and another part of the gigantic support structure showed its value, besides the usual Mission Control crowd. The Spider/Apollo 9 episode and the Apollo 8 episode may be my favorites. Apollo 11 was of course well done, but I am so familiar with the landing and its issues, that it was unable to surprise me much. However, the connection of Apollo 8 to 1968 and Apollo 9 to the creation of the LEM were both clever and solid storytelling that wonderfully mixed the technical and personal. Kudos also go to the story about the wives in the 11th episode. The families largely disappeared after the early segments, with the exception of Apollo 13, and Hanks was smart to round out the series with another round of human interest. Feel free to watch them over an extended period, sampling them occasionally. The episodes stand on their own quite well, or in groups 
Some customers have complained that this version has been chopped from the original. This is untrue. The original was shot in widescreen, and then cropped ("pan scan") for television broadcast. The first release of the DVD set included all of the episodes as broadcast, in the television aspect ratio. What you get here is a remastered version of all of the episodes, restored to thier original widescreen aspect ratio. The listing on IMDB does not list what the show was originally shot in, but only what it was originally produced in. This is definitely the definitive version of the series 
I will try to keep this short and sweet. I watch this series at least once a year to restore my faith in humanity. This is the sort of stuff that makes grown men weep. It is unbelievably powerful and moving. It is - without exception - my single favorite thing ever committed to film. This series is why I bought a DVD player. Enough said. 
Kudos to Tom Hanks for bringing a genuinely lavish production, historically based (and accurate) dramatization about the Space Race, and during Project Apollo, how the NASA eventually beat the Russians to the Moon. A fitting tribute to the famous JFK speech with a personal introduction from Mr. Hanks at the beginning of each episode, this DVD series will bring an almost spontaneous swell of American pride to anyone who watches it. The historical story lines, writing, actors' real people history maker protrayals, set decorations, stirring theme music and production qualities, are all truly terrific. A lot of previously heretofore unrevealed, behind the scenes, manned space program trials and tribulations go beyond merely the highlights into much deeper detail. This is movie making at its very best for both contemporary American history buffs as well as space afficionados with a penchant for all the technical aspects of Apollo. Well worth the DVD boxed set price for this superlative, albeit "TV" miniseries, the newly re-released, "Signature Edition", in High Definition (widescreen format) with DTS sound audio transfer, promises to be even better than the original. Come the third week of each July, this will be the only thing to watch on anyone's home theater system, as a traditional annual event, with episode #6 reserved for the 20th day of that month. This is the day in 1969 of the incredible first lunar landing, which should be a National Holiday to celebrate when men first set foot and saluted the American flag on the Moon. BRAVO to Tom Hanks and HBO for bringing us a fascinating story of for which ALL Americans can take great pride and enjoy for years to come! 
First off, let me say that the mini-series itself will probably never be equaled. It is truly spectacular - realistic, engaging, and thorough. I have to say, though, that for the huge price, I expected more from the extras. The two featurettes were great, but why not include the entire live broadcast of Kennedy's 1961 speech? I could get the transcript from a variety of sources and not have to pay for it. The same is true for the list of famous astronomers. I felt ripped off when I saw that everything else was just text and some still pictures. I don't buy DVDs to read or look at still art. That's a waste of the medium 
I am truly a "Johnny come lately" here as I just brought this mini-series and saw for the first time just very recently. I must say that I was totally impressed by the entire series. I have read many hypes about this mini-series. Many have wrote that this mini-series is perhaps the best ever made for TV next to the Band of Brothers. For once, the hype is true. This mini-series traced in twelve parts, the history of the Apollo space progam. The men and women who made it worked, made it happened along with disasters and mishaps. Outside of one episode, all others relating to the Apollo programs appears to have a great deal of historical accuracy. I have read the previous review about the widescreen conversion. I think there's a merit to that but I wasn't thrown off by it that much to make a difference to me. For me, it was the story that totally engrossed me. Another thing I like about this mini-series was that it didn't try to compared with movies like the Right Stuff or Apollo 13 but instead work around these two movies. Thus, if you watch Right Stuff, Apollo 13 and this mini-series, you will have a definite visual understanding as drama can have it, of United States entire space program until the end of the Apollo missions. The mini-series come highly recommend, almost a mandoratory viewing of any Americans who still can take pride in what we can do and accomplished if we put our collective effort into it 
According to the Internet Movie DataBase this miniseries was originally filmed in 1.33:1, so that means that the signature edition is reduced from fullscreen to widescreen for modern theatre-style TVs. That means a lot of the picture has been removed. In my view this is a fatal flaw. If you want the real version, get the older DVD set, as (in my opinion) this one doesn't have enough extras to recommend it even for people who own widescreen TVs. UPDATE: Recently I purchased the Signature Edition of this miniseries as my old one was badly damaged. So I had the opportunity to compare the two side-by-side. I immediately put a sample of both the old and new DVD episodes. Contrary to a later reviewer's assurances that this DVD set was filmed in 16/9 ratio, and that it was cropped for the original TV airing, I can now state with absolute certainty that that is not the case (or if it was, this edition has suffered a further cut, giving the viewer even less image - at least vertically - to watch). The Signature Edition is definitely a cropped version, as it showed a distinct loss of image at the bottom of the screen in the clips that I chose to compare. This does not apply to the titles, which have been re-done for this edition, and are an improvement for those of us with big screen TVs. It may be that the miniseries was filmed in something like 1.66:1 as it may be the case that in the horizontal plane some image has been recovered, but if it was filmed in 16/9 (1.78:1) the Signature Edition does not reflect that. Also, this DVD set has some very apparent visual flaws that are not evident in the original DVD release. During the special effects sequences (during spaceflight etc.) there are often visible horizontal mismatches on the film. These happen with almost every space sequence and are very distracting indeed because the eye is naturally drawn to the flaw. To be completely fair there's no way I can tell whether this is a DVD flaw, or if it's due to the transfer from my DVD player to the TV - but it shouldn't be there and I don't experience this flaw with any of my other DVDs. So my warning still stands. This is not the definitive edition of this miniseries. The original DVD release is the series as it was meant to be seen (uncropped vertically). The Signature Edition shows less image and a poor quality image, and the visual artifacts make the spaceflight sequences virtually unwatchable, especially on a larger screen. Needless to say, I returned this DVD set for a refund. In my opinion it is sub-standard. If this series was indeed filmed in 1.78:1 the definitive edition has yet to be seen on DVD. I would like to see such an edition in the future - perhaps remastered and enhanced for 16:9 viewing and perhaps in a HDTV format so that it can really be appreciated on big screen TVs 
I guess I am in the minority here. I happened to think that "In Dreams" was not only a very good film, [and disturbing] but very different from so many other thrillers. As for the cast, they are all top-notch, contrary to many other reviews. Claire Cooper (Annette Bening) portrays a mother of a young girl, and Claire also happens to be clairvoyant. She begins having dreams of a child that is about to be abducted and killed. She implores her husband to contact the police, and they dismiss him and her as just another nut-case. However, the Dreams she is experiencing are her own daughter. She does not realize this until her daughter is abducted and murdered. She attempts suicide after learning of her daughters death. Moreover, she is taken to a psychiatric hospital for observation. The Doctor is portrayed by Stephen Rea. The serial killer is Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey Jr.). And his childhood was not a very pleasant one. He also is able to reach into Claire's dream, and she into his. As she begins to experience more and more of her visions, and connection with the killer, she decides to help the latest victim [a young girl] who has also been recently abducted by Vivian. This film is not for everyone, and I give a lot of credit to the director, and more importantly the writers for coming up with something new, even if parts of the film are flawed. I would recommend at least renting the DVD, to see if you like it before purchasing, however I felt it was a very surrealistic and extremely well done thriller. And as for Annette Bening, she is terrific as Claire. [Stars: 5+ 
In Dreams is an extremely surreal movie shot in beautiful colors and unforgettable imagery. Quite shocking and violent, the scenes will stay with you for days after viewing this. Annette Benning gives a top notch preformance she IS Claire!!!!And Robert Downey Jr. gives a chilling preformance as Vivian, the confused villan.Highly reccomended nail biter...just wait until the climax at the end on the bridge.. 
Movie: *1/2 DVD Quality: **** DVD Extras: *** Don't be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members; "In Dreams" is without doubt THE career low for director/screenwriter Neil Jordan as well as actors Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and even Robert Downey, Jr. (who's made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career). The film aspires to be a psychological mystery-suspense-thriller in the vein of "Psycho" and "The Silence of the Lambs", but is completely undone by a cut-and-paste script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters; uninspired direction; shallow performances; choppy editing; and a grossly ineffective musical score. Only one scene in the movie is played convincingly, and that's the one in which Annette Bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally; pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion, Bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie. Unfortunately, that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other 97 minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile. In terms of technical quality, the DVD presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable. Picture quality is clear and sharp; the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots, but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers - I was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that I didn't stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question. The DVD extras are so-so: thumbnail cast and crew Biographies that mention much better movies; several lackluster screens filled with "Production Notes"; and finally, the Theatrical Trailer, which is probably the best thing on the disc because it's short and features quick flashes of the film's visual highlights. "In Dreams" is not recommended viewing, even for those viewers who enjoy bad movies for their camp value 
What a wonderfully bizarre thriller this is! Annette Benning's performance alone makes it worth watching - but there is still so much more. The story is so unsettling you never quiet get your grip once the film starts moving. From the opening credits - where a ghost town becomes submerged as a reservoir to the jump-out-of-your-seat ending, this one is a real keeper. The photography and set pieces are absolutely beautiful and do much put the viewer in Benning's head. A wild, frightening trip 
Somehow I feel that if this film had been even stranger, it may have been more critically popular. Had it not bothered with as linear a storyline and just followed the dream-logic plotlines it may have been hailed as a David Lynch-like fairy tale nightmare; add more violence and it could be a Dario Argento film. But instead we have something by Neil Jordan, who gives this film more wonder and magic (albeit dark) than anyone else could. I think it's a great film. See, it's called In Dreams, not In Logic. Its surreality is its strength, staying visually spectacular at all times and boosted by an absolutely great performance by Annette Bening. I think the plot contrivances are almost subversive; OF COURSE there are moments of coincidence because that's what happens in dreams. Moments of opportunity or clarity (claire-ity?) arrive for our heroine and she takes them in stride. The film's general feel is continuously reinforced by the eerie flooded dream village in the reservoir, and the fairy tale orchard. This is a Grim tale alright, but its beautiful, trippy and saturated in atmosphere. Killer ending too, closing a disturbingly satisfying thriller by a masterful director. Highly recommended for those who like to dream 
I ordered two DVD's the third and fourth seasons of All in the Family after I had received season's one and two as Christmas gifts. The DVD's came within three days after I ordered them. The quality was was excellent, the only diffence between Amazon DVD's and the store brought DVD's are the price. The person who gave me the gifts said they paid about $9.00 more per DVD. Thanks Amazon 
In Mike's Appendix,the episode where Archie says Doctors wear masks is because they steal from people,when they operate 
I can't begin to tell you how happy we are to have purchased these DVDs'. We will treasure them forever. We are disapointed though that the remaining seasons are not available. We wouldn't hesitate to complete the series. Thank you very much. Greg Gerno

The #1 Nielsen rated program from 1971 to 1976, All In The Family is quite simply one of the greatest television programs in history. Inspired by The Honeymooners and The Flintstones, All In The Family features its own loud-mouthed, opinionated blowhard sporting a hidden soft and sensitive side. Like Ralph Kramden and Fred Flintstone, Archie Bunker fulfills his role to absolute perfection, and the result is TV magic. Well-written and outright hilarious, All In The Family broke ground in the 70's with its willingness to tackle all the social issues and societal taboos of its day. Topics included racism, bigotry, sexism, homosexuality, death, and other namby-pam, socialist and liberal-feminist ideals (or at least that's how Archie would put it!) A titan among television sitcoms, All In The Family spawned a pair of shows which topped the ratings in their own right - Maude and The Jeffersons... Carroll O'Connor plays the role of Archie Bunker, the titular head of the Bunker household. Loud and crass, Archie freely dispenses his bigoted remarks and ignorant comments from the living room of his Queens, New York home. Joining Archie is his loving and ditsy wife Edith (Jean Stapelton), his beautiful and progressive daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), and her ultra-liberal husband Mike (Rob Reiner) whom Archie refers to as "Meathead". As Gloria and Mike's modern ideas clash with Archie's old school beliefs, all hell breaks loose in the Bunker household, but the Bunkers don't spend all their time arguing as they're inevitably held together by the immutable bond of love... The All In The Family (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere "Archie and the Editorial" in which Archie ardently defends his anti-gun control views on a TV editorial show, only to be held up by a pair of muggers wielding a gun when he leaves the station. The incident causes Archie to transform into a gun control advocate... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include "Lionel Steps Out" in which Lionel Jefferson takes Archie's niece out on the town (peeving Archie who believes whites and blacks don't mix), and "Mike's Appendix" in which Archie and Gloria fight over the credentials of female doctors when Mike is forced to have an emergency appendectomy... Below is a list of episodes included on the All In The Family (Season 3) DVD: Episode 38 (Archie and the Editorial) Episode 39 (Archie's Fraud) Episode 40 (The Threat) Episode 41 (Gloria and the Riddle) Episode 42 (Lionel Steps Out) Episode 43 (Edith Flips Her Whig) Episode 44 (The Bunkers and the Swingers) Episode 45 (Mike Comes Into Money) Episode 46 (Flashback: Mike and Gloria's Wedding: Part 1) Episode 47 (Flashback: Mike and Gloria's Wedding: Part 2) Episode 48 (The Locket) Episode 49 (Mike's Appendix) Episode 50 (Edith's Winning Ticket) Episode 51 (Archie and the Bowling Team) Episode 52 (Archie in the Hospital) Episode 53 (Oh Say Can You See) Episode 54 (Archie Goes Too Far) Episode 55 (Class Reunion) Episode 56 (Hot Watch) Episode 57 (Archie is Branded) Episode 58 (Everybody Tells the Truth) Episode 59 (Archie Learns His Lesson) Episode 60 (Gloria, the Victim) Episode 61 (The Battle of the Month) The DVD Repor 
Nothing beats this show. Archie was recently rated the number 1 television character of all time by Bravo for a reason (Edith was number 12). Highly recommend since the re-runs that are seen on various TV stations are chopped by about 2 1/2 minutes a piece 
I am a diehard AITF fan since it first aired so I don't care about extras or digital remasterings. What is being shown on the DVD includes the footage that hasn't been aired in thirty years because it was trimmed out so they could show more commercials in syndicated reruns. This series was a seminal piece of television history. In the current political climate of hypersensitivity and political correctness a series like this could never be produced and it is a sad commentary on how low American culture has declined. I don't know what is holding up the DVD releases but I would snap up the entire series plus ABP in a boxed set in a second and I wish that is how they would just release this series 
I love AITF. Always have. And was very excited about the fact that 'it' was going to be available on DVD. It was - as most of us know - a 'landmark' TV show. It changed TV. But what a shame. The picture quality of the DVD is absolutely horrible. NO better - in fact - than the VHS tapes I have of the show. [that I taped myself] And what excuse is there for no 'extras'? Compared to other 'complete seasons' - like the 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' or 'Here's Lucy' [among others] the AITF is a disgrace. Even the box it comes in is done on the cheap. Without question - AITF should have been [at least] digitally remastered. 'All in the Family' is a 5-star show. 'The complete third season' is a 2-star effort. [at best] I have no idea what the first and second season are like - but I already feel as though I've been robbed - and am not about to make that mistake again 
Yes, Everyone Loves Raymond can't hold a candle to All in the Family...from ANY of the 9 seasons. If you are some young kiddo who has never seen an episode of All in the Family, please try to catch it. This 3rd installment in the series took TOO LONG to get to the market and doesnt have enough extras. Why doesnt Sally Struthers do commentary? You figure she would have the time. The shows look and sound great. The 'subtitle' option is hilarious with the way they represent Archie's 'Bunkerisms'. I will buy all the seasons when they eventually come out. This show should be run on prime time network television to remind everyone what QUALITY really means. 
If you know U2 at all, you know that they are one of the most successful rock bands of all time, and their concerts are always amazing. This DVD is great in that it doesn't edit out alot of the flaws and Bono's little speeches in between songs. Adds to the authenticity of the recordings. The big thing that's pretty annoying about it would be some of the awkward cuts made to blend both days of the concert into one on the DVD. The other thing is those stupid shots of Bono's hands that come up way too often. Other than that, it's worth buying. The last encore is the greatest. One by one the band members leave the stage, while the others are still playing. Excellent 
This was delivered quickly - in excellent condition -- thank 
I have been a U2 fan since the mid 80's. If you are a dedicated fan and enjoy watching music concerts on DVD, then U2 - Vertigo 2005 is a must buy. The DVD is very entertaining with Bono's storytelling, U2's performance in Chicago, and the crowd's response. You will not be disappointed and possibly break a tear during the final encore. 
From a serious U2 fan's perspective, the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs. The bonus material is cool, the sound quality's great, the visuals are always impressive, but it's the SONGS that are the real attraction. As it should be. Two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album BOY, four in a row from the all-time masterpiece ACHTUNG BABY, and nearly everything from their Grammy-sweeping triumph HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB. I also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums. Good call! Also, Many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments, such as Running To Stand Still (a perfect hybrid of the Joshua Tree and Zoo TV versions), Elevation (longer, better build-up), Bullet The Blue Sky (check out Edge's extended blues jam in the final minutes), and Original of the Species (acoustic piano ballad). This was the first major U2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list. For instance, when I saw them they played Miss Sarajevo, Stuck In A Moment, Gloria, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, Instant Karma, Until The End Of The World, and others not represented here. Here's hoping they release at least one more Vertigo Tour DVD... 
The 2 disk version is really only for die hard fans (like me) - same goes for the recently released Zoo TV DVD set. However, anyone else who even vaguely likes U2 will find the single disc versions excellent. It's typically U2 and basically enjoyable to watch. The sound and picture quality is good and you get what is esentially a U2 concert (seemingly unedited) with Bono up to his usual antics and the band playing as well as they usually do - althogh I'm sure that some tracks will have been taken out to fit the DVD into the required space. Enjoy 
Reviewer: G. M. R. JOSE "GRAZ" - See all my reviews  If you enjoy their music and had the chance to go to one of their Vertigo Tour concerts, you'll love this video. I have a few friends that follow U2 just as much as I do but couldn't go, and every time one of them asked how did the concert go? We watched the video. There are things that words can't explain, so It's great to have this video, so that I can transmit the emotion and excitement of being there. Everyone who has seen it has enjoyed it from start to finish. To me is a great video (political rant included). Peace!! 
I disagree with the opinion of those reviewers who found the editing/photography of the concert captured in this DVD to be lacking. As a matter of fact, I felt the video was even more interesting as a result of it. I got a feel of being in the stage with the band, very close to them as I was watching it, which is not an experience you can typically have even while attending the concert. Musically, the concert offered an assortment of material, both old and new, to wet the appetites of most U2 fans, plus it accomplished what I've never felt at a U2 concert before: a sense of intimacy with the guys in the band and the audience that is odd for an arena show like the United Center where the taping took place. Overall, while not the most innovative show by U2 ever (that would have to be the Zoo TV Tour video), I highly enjoyed it and recommend it 
I work as an editor on high-end projects (mostly commercials and music video's with a couple of well regarded concert DVD's and award winning short film work to my credit) and I have to say that the editing on this disc (and the previous 2, to a lesser extent) demonstrates a real lack of sensitivity to the material. There is an epic quality to U2 in concert. Each song is its own experience... its own mini event; and instead of letting the power of that experience unfold naturally and organically... letting the music/performance tell its own story (and what a story it is!) the editing imposes itself on the music and the performance(s) and the effect is that you are taken out of (or at least not fully drawn into) the marvelous natural flow of power that is U2 live. All 3 of these DVD's are worth having simply because the band's brilliance in concert mostly transcends the poor editing but these discs COULD have been truly amazing documentations of almost religious experiences had the director/editor gotten out of their own way and really understood and felt into the event(s). What a shame 
The acting, writing, and complete look of the film are completely fantastic. Everything is fantastic, but Jim Carrey steals the scenes, in a very good way. Every time he is on the screen, he is pure Jim. The character he plays on the movie is as if it was written just for him, he fits is role perfectly. The scenery in the movie is very dark and gloomy, which sets the perfect tone for the film. The costumes; suits and dresses, all look great and the entire things comes together very nicely. Overall, this is a must see for fans of Jim Carrey. If you love a good movie, you will love this. Like I said, this role was made for JC!! 
Both of my daughter's read the entire series of books [so far] and I decided to treat them to this film when it was released. Or was it the other way around. Anyway, suffice it to say, I was more than pleased with this film. The devious Count Olaf [Jim Carrey] was a true joy to watch. And the laughter from my daughters was more than worth sitting through the movie. I really enjoyed the film, and let me tell you, children as well as adults will enjoy this film! On a visual level, the film is absolutely stunning: sort of a Tim Burton influence. I really liked the part of Aunt Josephine [Meryl Streep]. There is a hilarious part with her and Count Olaf as she is about to be let go on one of the boats. (I'll let you viewers watch this part, as I don't wish to spoil it for you). And the house Aunt Josephine resides in at Lake Lachrymose has a surrealistic and eerie look to it. Just great! If you have not seen the film, then rent it or buy it. I found it to be hilarious and as much fun for adults as well as children. I really do hope they make another one: as the books continue for quite some time. I believe the first three books were the basis for this particular film. I would like to see more misadventures of the Baudelaire children with their nemesis Count Olaf, I don't know if there will be, but it would be great. And how about the end credits? Best I have ever seen: A work of art in itself. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed--especially if you have children. 
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, the movie, is an adaptation of the first 3 books in the Lemony Snicket's printed books. The movie plot is very much the same as the story of the first three books. #1 - The Bad Beginning #2 - The Reptile Room #3 - The Wide Window In the Series of Unfortunate Events isn't a happily ever after kind of story. There are three regular children: Violet, who loves to invent Klaus, who loves to read and Sunny who loves to bite Violet is the oldest, Claus the middle child, Sunny is the youngest. The book "The Bad Beginning" is the basis for the first part of the movie. The story begins when the Baudelaire children are informed by Mr. Poe, a banking accountant, that their parents have just been killed by a mysterious fire, and thus begins a series of search for a suitable guardian and a safe place to live. The siblings closest member to their parents is supposedly Count Olaf, only he's not nice. He's exactly the opposite and he plans to steal the immense fortune left by the Baudelaire parents. In The Bad Beginning, things, well, begin badly for the three Baudelaire orphans. And sadly, events only worsen in The Reptile Room. As the siblings move in with their new guardian Professor Montgomery, they find he is a reptile scientist. In a room with many different reptiles, there's a newly discovered reptile that he called a deadly, dangerous snake. But it's not really dangerous at all. Later Montes get a new assistant and it is Count Olaf in disguise. Of course something terrible happens to Uncle Morty after that and Count Olaf again tries to kidnap the children. In the Wide Window, Mr. Poe places the children with a distant relative, Aunt Josephine. Aunt Josephiine lives in a house on the edge of a hill, a house that is very literally above Lake Lachrymose, a lake infested with Lachrymose Leeches who would eat a human if they smelled food on them. Aunt Josephine is as eccentric as other relatives have been. She's a total grammar freak and so scared of every thing that the children have to live in a cold house and eat cold food because their aunt is afraid of accidents with fire. When Aunt Josephine meets Captain Sham who (who is Count Olaf in disguise), good fortune turns bad. Aunt Josephine dies and the apparent cause of death is jumping through the wide window in the living room, leaving the three children to Captain Sham (who is Count Olaf in disguise). As the orphans try to figure out a way to escape from Count Olaf, they discover their aunt is still alive and in hiding. So they set out to find her and convince her to come back. This eventually leads them out onto the dreadful Lake Lachrymose where Count Olaf and the dreaded leaches catch up with them. While the books leave much to the imagination, the visual effects and stunning backdrdops of the movie are well detailed, in contrast to the often sparse details in the books. 
I'm not very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than Harry Potter. The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round. The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but "Lemony Snicket..." entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!). There's a lot of CGI here but not to the point to annoy you, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performance to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles. The great cast is completed with respectable names (Luiz Guzmï¿½n, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, Cedric the Entertainer...) in small roles. Sublime film. It's funny, it's interesting, it's creative! I recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art, if you like Jim Carrey, and if you like unique plots, highly recommended for all type of audiences! 
This movie is based on the first three books in the series of thirteen very short volumes. A lot of people, who apparrently hadn't read the book(s) say Jim Carey basically played himself in the movie, but this couldn't be further from the truth--he played the part perfectly. I'm not a big Jim Carey fan, but think he does get a bad rap for no apparrent reason. The last big criticism of him was for Cable Guy--in which he actually played a serious role. I suppose Cable Guy was a comedy, but it was a 'black comedy' and this movie is much the same. Sure this movie (and the written story) is funny, but it's also in that Harry Potter (or Peter Pan, or Alice in Wonderland, or The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, or many other much greater and confirmed classic 'children's stories') stream of being a good story for children that's not the traditional 'happily ever after.' It wont give your kids nightmares or bruise their fragile sensibilities, but it might fire a few more brain cells than other childrens stories which strain themselves not to cross those lines parents draw in our V-chip American society. Put more frankly, your kids wont turn into serial killers because they watched or read something that wasn't completely innocent, puritanical, or childish. Bottom Line: Because the movie really turned me onto the books, I'm glad I saw it. I also think this is a great performance by Jim Carey, from whom we normally expect only silliness. 
I saw this movie before I read the books. The books are much funnier, and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film. Still, I liked the film and especially Baby Sunny. I thought Jim Carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions (as always) brought the character to life. I think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film, the essence of the story was captured, and is entertaining. But I do recommend reading the Series before or after watching the film 
This is Carey at his best. This movie is hilarious and the special features are awesome 
A delightful little movie based on a series of delightful little children's stories (with, maybe, a bit more bite than the average fare). Of course, it won't be for everyone. A Series of Unfortunate Events is about the three Baudelaire orphans who are shuttled from foster home to foster home pursued by the evil Count Olaf. A laughable, over-the-top villain determined to capture the orphans' family fortune. This movie takes the first three novels of the series (purported to be 13 books in all, plus an "autobiography" of the "author") and blends them wonderfully into one tale (sticking the 2nd and 3rd into the middle of the first book). It brings the tales to life with delightful scenery and excellent casting. Jim Carrey brings Olaf to life. And, YES, he is "overacting" but he is absolutely true to the character in the books. He is perfect in his role. Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep have great turns as well. If you're a fan of these books, you likely won't be disappointed. If you've never read them, you may like this movie too, just know that it's a little stylized and "over the top." In the end, it's a lot of fun, and not that's not such an unfortunate thing in a film 
This is an excellent film with Freddie and Julia. They made a great combo! I have been searching for the dvd for a while. Now, I finally have it in my hands!! 
With so many good acters in this film you would think this would be a good film.Its a rubbish love story.It had a few good songs and thats why i havwe giving this film 2 stars.This movie is not worth watching 
I love this movie. It is a modern day romantic comedy that anyone will enjoy watching 
If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in "Arrested Development". Watching this movie for "Prinz" and "Stiles" is counterproductive. Not only have the actors "failed to make the best" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences. Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming "singer-songwriters", and "stop paying attention" to their college plans. Much like the "Friends" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a "time porn" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides "mature romantically" and "find themselves". A movie for history's circular file 
I'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of this movie. I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it, and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance... all in all, this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back. The performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends. To be fair, this movie does face several major obstacles. It has the misfortune to depend on the "acting" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher. It fails on all counts. I do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the "teen" movie sub-genre, under which some would place "Down to You." (In fact, "Can't Hardly Wait" is one of my favorite movies.) I simply hate BAD movies, and this movie is a true abomination. If you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all means, buy this DVD. If, however, you value your sanity, then please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away from this movie 
I Love Romantic Movies And This Is The List Topper On All Extents Of Cute Movies. I Love Julia Stiles. She's A Great Actress. Every Hopeless Romantic Should See This 
Many of these shorts on this DVD (as well as the other DVD's in this series) have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these DVD's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you'll see on the cartoons 
Plot: A mafia lawyer commits suicide. But before he does, he forces 11-year old Mark Sway (Who lives with his brother and mother in a trailer park) into the car. And so he tells Mark secrets about where Loisianna Senator Boyd Boyette was buried. Since Mark's little brother has a stress syndrome (he can't see anything scary), Randy Sway had to go to the hospital. Ever since his father was divorced, he tends to believe that lawyers are morons (at times, they can get in the way) and gets his info about courts and judges on T.V. Mark meets Reggie Love, a woman lawyer who used to have a drinking problem; at first, he doesn't trust her. After many pelts by F.B.I, mafia, and annoying reporters (already sick of Elvis sightings), Mark has to trust her. Positives: Mark is told by Reggie that he can't lie, or he'll be just like them (mafia). As such, the mafia in this movie are seen as a bunch of criminals. Even though Mark was threatened by a very nasty mafia "dude", he tries to tell the truth, he didn't tell about where Boyd was buried. Many scriptures from the bible are written in cells and there is a picture of Jesus in the hospital. Though Mark can be a pest at times, Reggie tries to help him because she cares about him. Negatives: For those people who don't like cursing, there is a moderate amount of cussing in the film. 1/3 of them comes from Mark Sway's mouth, which disturbed me a bit. Mark also gives a mafia guy the middle finger secretly. Mark disobeys his mother by going in the woods and therefore, getting mixed up with all this. Mark got his info about an affair like this on T.V, and he claims that he saw a guy having his legs blown off because of the witness protection program (on T.V, though this isn't shown). Due to medication, Mark's mother fights the F.B.I at one point, though you have to watch to find out. Funnies: In the hospital, "Elvis" complains about his guitar. The way Reggie deals with Mark at times can be humorous. Conclusion: If you can take the negatives, then I highly recommend this movie. Though, I'd like to say that you shouldn't buy "The Client" To anybody younger than thirteen because even though violence is rarely seen. 
A mixture of well-developed characters, seemingly inescapable situations, mystery, thrilling action and truly scary moments make this film a solid piece of work. The seasoned and talented cast add the spice that makes this a tasty thriller for any fan of the cinema. Emotion spills effortlessly into every corner of the film, spreading 'human' moments everywhere. There's never a dull moment 
The is an excellent movie packed full of fine actors and a plot that grabs you immediately and doesn't let go. The young boy who stars with Susan Sarandon is an excellent actor and plays such a strong and admirable character of not only a boy his age but of any age. A movie I will want to watch again 
I enjoyed this movie because it had both suspense and entertainment in it and an excellent cast. I highly recommend it 
It's been years since I'd seen The Client, but I found the performances of Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones as adept and entertaining as ever. Bradley Whitford was playing Josh Lyman long before West Wing, and it was fun to see him in this film, and funny to think he's been playing with or near Mary Louise Parker for years! (They seem so young and ageless.) This is a great film to watch when it's grey and cold outside because it's always warm and pretty in Memphis in this film 
Kids will be kids! Within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive, honorable and brave. These raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of "love." Risk becomes only the next step. Susan Sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength, courage, wit and willingness to go up against the BIG, tough bad guys with all the money and power. Tommy Lee Jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power "fools. 
I saw this movie a few months ago on an import dvd. I do have to say, the movie was great.Brad Renfro plays Mark ,a rebelling boy, who knows something that he don't have to know. Susan Sarandon plays a lawyer who helps Mark. She did it great. Tommy Lee Johnes plays a Lawyer who want to ask Mark what he saw. You must watch it.. 
brilliant Surandon is captivating Tommy Lee Jones is ruthless in his role the movie has some funny scenes touching and sad scenes and is just an all out powerful movie This is one powerful drama movie with a bit of humor at times it's really sad what happens at the beginning. but the ending is great. I love the cast. the director adapting the movie from book is great. not an easy book to do an adaptation to. the young boy who plays Mark is very stylish in his role. you can figure out what I mean by that if you want. I saw this in 11th grade in my American Legal Systems class and got hooked on it. yesterday bought it on dvd and will watch this one over and over again. it's really a classic drama. 
I teach high school Economics and show this video to every class. I have seen it myself over 50 times and still love it every time. It is great for students to see what corporate giants have to go through to get where they are. I point out subtleties in the content- at the time we had no cell phones, answering machines, remote controls... I also love to point out the "stupid corporate guys" who had no clue or foresight. The philosophical differences in the 2 corporations is amazing. Don't know how accurate the details are, but it makes for a good dramatization. Not only that, the the music is outstanding. 
XLNT background of the early years. I'm sure that people who are finally getting fed up with the PC world will have a lot of fun with any of the Apple's. The movie is a must see 
Several aspects catapulted me into this movie with a mesmerizing intensity which caused me to watch it several times, and to know I'll continue to do so periodically. The strongest draw to this work of art for me was to the performance of the actor (Anthony Michael Hall) playing Bill Gates, which he did with such exquisite skill that he made me feel he had captured the essence, the quiet radiance, the charisma, maybe even the core, of that larger-than-human persona, more brilliantly than I've seen done for any other characterization of a "real-life-person" on film. In fact, each of the key actors in this film went beyond the level of outstanding, in seeming to capture his/her character in a primal essence. The voices and mannerisms of Gates, Jobs, and Wozniac, have stayed with me with such a synaptive strength that I can hear and see them any time my thoughts go there. The actors didn't stand alone, however. They were supported with awesome perfection by the book's balanced storyline, and the art and technique of the film-making, which was executed so naturally as to be baseline effective without the viewer noticing the designs and efforts toward effect. There was no overwhelm of design; only the feel of it. There was the being one with the language of film, which overtook whatever reality had been playing prior to the first millisecond of the movie's motion. (For a bare bones of additional detail about film-making technique, feel free to see my review of the DVD of the movie, Suspect Zero.) Each time I re-view my copy of PIRATES OF SILICON VALLEY, I'm left with an intense curiosity about how true to reality it seemed, and about Gates, Jobs, Wozniac, and the other characters "takes" of this rendition of who they were and what they did. A few reviews have helpfully mentioned visiting Wozniac or Gates web sites, and noted that the movie was described as being generally accurate. If anyone has any added information on Gates or Jobs specific comments on this movie, please consider beginning a Forum in the Customer Discussion section on this page? To be fair, maybe I should offer a few backup details for my over-the-top praise above. Here's what I see so clearly, even now, in Bill Gates as shown in PIRATES: I see him regularly pushing the bridge of his glasses up to a clearer viewing angle; I see the direct, open-eyed gaze of this ancient, wise soul working within a child's free-flowing, anticipatory mind. I see his continual eagle-eyed expression, his intense curiosity and constant calculation. It appeared to me that, for Gates, as portrayed by the actor in this film, computers are not machines; they're kindred spirits. And I don't mean that as an insult. Steve Jobs was also shown in his unique ways of gazing, studying whatever was in his presence; his ways of speaking, and of flickering continually from a sun-splitting smile to a deadly scowl. Moods. He was a full course STUDY in them, at least as dramatized by the actor who portrayed him. Then, of course, there was the most obvious of the many film techniques used so beautifully, that of posing the head and shoulders of Bill Gates on a large movie screen in the background, with Steve Jobs standing in a full-body pose, live, behind a podium, below the huge, two-dimensional, yet ominous presentation on the screen. Yeah, Big Brother was alive and well, ever ready, ever in the background of Jobs' motions, with no loss of strength or imposition. And yet ... And yet ... Bill Gates came across as a hero, to me, along with everyone involved in this landmark expression of part of the evolution of human brain cell enhancement. The way these two cultural giants were played against each other, in storyline and through the art of film, was an accomplishment of the type of simple genius which, in some ways, goes beyond even the great gifts of the Einstein's among us. There is so MUCH art, angst, and significance in this film, I doubt its makers have seen every angle and facet of it. This is something. This is something. I don't know, exactly, if the film intended it, but each time I come away from this movie, I see all the people in it as nothing less than heroic. Yet, the movie clearly brought out actions and behaviors which I could not condone in any other context, in fact, which I might condemn. However, I rarely mark something with a negative triple six; as soon as I think about picking up a single stone, the smudges on my vest begin growing. Very purposely, that chagrin situation was exposed here. This movie captures and holds not only high entertainment with heavy drama and deep comedy; it also expresses: Irony, Anomaly, Paradox, Dichotomy, Dilemma, and more. I seek words which mean: "The containment of opposites within a single framework, containment of a long enough duration for the duality to do the Hegel-ian thing, the ultimate growth sequence of Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis." Yet, these two opposing elements will not synthesize, except separately, so the Thesis, Antithesis, Thesis, Antithesis seems to be in an eternal loop, which somehow enhances life and growth rather than diminishing or draining it. If I attempt to analyze this movie much further my eyes will cross and my brain will ... will what? It won't melt down ... it won't shut off with "does not compute." What it will do is slip irrevocably into a Gordian Knot at the base of a Universal Labyrinth. Bye, bye. Don't go there. I have more work to do. Thank you Bill, Steve, the makers of THE PIRATES OF SILICONE VALLEY (see the credits on this page), and the authors (Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine) of the novel, FIRE IN THE VALLEY, upon which this movie (made for cable, TNT, in 1999) was based. I could almost say the film went as far as Gates and Jobs (and their associates, friends, and families) took us, as a race, as a species, as an intriguing culture in a sentient Universe. Maybe it's not achieving warp drive capacity which first brings a species to the attention of aliens at higher levels of consciousness and accomplishment (as Star Trek has so lusciously dramatized). Maybe it's achieving what all the above, and the ripples from them have done. I can't understand why the debut of this movie didn't bring on First Contact. Or, has it? Where are the X-Files? Are they SLEEPING?? Chust Kidding! What would you expect from an author of a sci fi and a paranormal mystery series who periodically reviews Amish mysteries? I, myself, am an Anomaly, a Dichotomy, ... and some (though not a "sum") of all of the above. Linda Shelnutt 
I enjoyed this movie when it first aired on TNT, and only recently got around to buying it. As others have said, it's a reasonably accurate portrayal of the beginnings of Apple and Microsoft. Though, Pirates really shows its age today. Keep in mind that when this was made in 1999, there was no iPod or OS X, and the iMac hadn't been available long enough to show any sort of turnaround for Apple. Also at the time, Microsoft's plagues of security vulnerabilities and missed product deadlines were rarely published in mainstream media. So with all things considered, it's interesting to see this again, with today's perspective. As far as the DVD goes, it's pretty sparse on extras (a 5 minute clip of Noah W. and a trailer), and perhaps more disappointingly, is displayed in 4:3. I can't complain too much for a made-for-tv movie, but you don't really get tons of value for what this disc costs 
This is a pretty close account of how our technology (of today) started. I too watched this movie when it came out on cable (TNT) and enjoyed it. I would say this movie is about 85-90% accurate at the time when Microsoft and Apple came about. Very good acting from all actors. If you are interested in how the two giants started, this is the movie to start with. This movie is a keeper 
This was made for TNT in 1999. It never ceases to surprise me how good most of the cable movies are and this is no exception. Noah Wyle plays Steve Jobs and Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates. I don't know how much of this movie is true. It's based on a book. Still, it was entertaining and I'm guessing most of it is fact based. Jobs and Gates are two very different people in personality. Jobs seems more creative and Gates more logical. Both are power hungry and will get it by any means. Lots of subterfuge. But Jobs bothered me more because of the way he treated his girlfriend and his daughter by her. I couldn't understand how he could be so cold toward them. Especially considering his own background. I don't want to reveal too much in case anyone chooses to watch this film. Anyway, I do recommend this. It doesn't matter if you know much about computers or not. It's about how they built their empires and them as people. 
if you are interested in computer history and the fight between microsoft and apple still very hot today this is a must have dvd 
This is an excellent movie, one of the best made for tv movies I've ever seen. Its close enough to true for me and has the benifet of being very well acted and dramatized. Noah Wyle does a phenomenal job as Steve Jobs, followed by Anthony Michael Hall's suburb potrail of Bill Gates. All the roles are well acted and the actors bare striking resemblances to the actual players involved. If you are interested in the computer industry at all I highly recomend this product (as well as triumph of the nerds) 
This movie is a bit anti-Microsoft-most movies root for the underdog after all-and plays up Steve Jobs wackiness, but overall it's solid. I've watched it many, many times and even though it thumbnails the events rather than covers them in detail, I enjoy it. Also recommended: Triump of the Nerds, the 3 hour documentary about the same period that was made prior to this 
I've been wanting to watch this for a long time and finally got the dvd. This is a story of personalities and egos and visionaries...both Noah Wyle and Anthony Michael Hall do an exceptional job of becoming the computer world's most iconic figures. Equally enjoyable are the actors who play Steve Wozniak, Paul Allen and Steve Ballmer. This could easily have been a mini-series...worth watching! 
This DVD exposes the Ultimate Warrior as 25% postitive and 75% negative. I do believe that Jim Hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis. Just another case of a wreslter who couldn't seperate himself from the character, and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges. The only thing that bothers me is that Jim Hellwig wasn't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions. He was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact. Jim Hellwig declined, used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit. This guy did make an impact in the wrestling world, but it was too shortlived. Fans can chalk it up as a cool memory, but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with Flair, Piper, Hogan, and the most respected of all The Undertaker 
If you liked the Ultimate Warrior at all during the late 80's, you will like this DVD. It may be a one sided account of the Ultimate Warrior's tenure, but it still is one of the better made WWE documentaries. Super fans of the Ultimate Warrior will be disappointed with the views, but fans of wrestling will find it informative and entertaining. 
THIS DVD IS SO FUNNY. I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, U HAVE TO GET THIS DVD. IT SHOWS HOW MUCH OF AN IDIOT THE WARRIOR REALLY WAS, HOW MUCH TALENT HE DIDN'T HAVE, HIS TERRIBLE MIC SKILLS, ETC. THE EXPRESSION "MILLION DOLLAR BODY, 10 CENT BRAIN" FITS HIM O TO WELL. BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF GOOD MATCHES, I MEAN, GRANTED THE OTHER GREAT "ACTUAL" WRESTLERS PULLED HIM THROUGH THE MATCHES 
This is a must-have DVD, not only for wrasslin' fans, but for all of mankind. You will learn the ways of the WARRIOR and hopefully learn something about yourself as well. 
This DVD is hilarious.. Ultimate Warrior was a pretty cool character but legally changing his name to the Warrior... That is downright weird. christain is too funny in his impressionation 
I have mixed feelings about the content of this DVD. Growing up as a young teenager in the early 90's, the Warrior was my favourite wrestler. The music, the frenetic and almost spastic ring entrance, the Incredible Hulk-a-like style inside the ring... Coming some years after his fall from grace and seeing he had a web-site (www.ultimatewarrior.com) I eagerly logged on to see what he was doing these days. The impression I got was that the man was a complete lunatic who had been possessed by his character like Linda Blair was possessed by the Devil in The Exorcist. His posts on his web-site are like an ever so slightly toned down version of his gibberings on promo slots during his wrestling days. One gets the impression that the man got bored of real life so made himself believe he was his character and wrapped himself up in a fairy story where he was the central (and only) starring figure. He could certainly have had a better claim to the "Narcissist" gimmick Lex Luger ran during the early part of 1993. This is the impression we get from his contemporaries who are interviewed on the DVD too. Jim Ross, Ted Dibiase, Bobby Heenan, Vince McMahon, Jerry Lawler... All line up to castigate the Warrior and tell stories of how stiff his performances were, how little technical skill he had, what a self-centred egomaniac he was, and how selfish and ignorant he could be. I would have been horrified and outraged at this character assassination and instantly suspected another McMahon speciality screw job (a' la Bret Hart) if it wasn't for the fact that this was the exact same impression I'd gotten from the man's own disjointed, ramblings on his web-site. I don't doubt for a second that most, if not all, of these highly entertaining anecdotes are true. Having said that, I am left with no doubt that Vince McMahon is also an unprincipled liar and an opportunistic screw-job artist. The way he talks about the faults of others breaks the known bounds of hypocrisy, considering he is capable of being the most dishonest, conniving and unprofessional man in the industry. Him criticising the Warrior's ethos is like a skunk complaining that a dog stinks. McMahon has a brilliant brain for wrestling and its various angles, but as a human being he is worth nothing. Doesn't detract from the fact that he's probably telling the truth about the Warrior here however. Having said this, the Warrior is still my favourite wrestler of all time and this DVD not only gives you the career commentary, but five of his most memorable matches as an extra: his WWF debut against a "jobber"; his under 60 second IC title win against the Honky Tonk Man at Summerslam 88; his WWF title win against Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania 6; the WWF title defence against Rick Rude at Summerslam 90, and the thunderous career ending match against Randy Savage at Wrestlemania 7. (The last one being my all time favourite Warrior match and not containing the cuts and rewinds the WM 7 VHS video had.) The wrestling content of this DVD is great, especially for us nostalgia lovers and especially for actual fans of the Warrior. Say what you like about the man (and I obviously have done) but the wrestler was great fun and captivating to watch. The interview content is also captivating and fun. The newer and younger guys (Christian and Chris Jericho - to name two off the top of my head) are all enthusiastic about the Warrior and recall his days with great enthusiasm (they never had to work with him mind you). Seeing Christian's impression of a classic Warrior promo is side-splitting. If you're a fan of wrestling back in the early 90's, then go ahead and get this, you won't regret it. If you were a fan of the Warrior himself, then this DVD is probably worth sacrificing one of your internal organs for 
This film is based on a concept that has potential - a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things - but it doesn't deliver. Clearly, the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us, but he pretty much drops the ball right there. Usually with this sort of plot, you are at least given the illusion that *someone* knows the answer and what's more has some clue about what to do with it as well. There's no such suspension of disbelief in this one, nor even an attempt at such. Adding injury (if you count eye strain) to insult, the whole thing is shot in grainy B with annoying MTV-style jump cuts. In the awards for Obnoxious Splash Films of the Year, this one takes the cake, but not the Pi 
With a reference to Jewish mysticism, this black and white movie perfectly highlights a psychotic world of a talented mathematician attempting to unlock world mysteries "Chaos" (see: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32NUR740CAUFR/ref=cm_cr_auth/104-6854701-1987133?ie=UTF8 ) is much close to resolve. Although mixing a Hasidic community with the Wall Street sharks might usher into unwelcome parallels, I like authors' depiction of New York environment -busy streets,sub,neighbouring- very much. 
Pi is a film that will most likely stay with you long after you watch it. Darren Aronofsky (Requium For A Dream) created an entertaining experimental film with Pi. A very dark movie (aside from being black and white) with a great techno score, and extremley bizzare scenes and images. Pi is a great movie, but I dont think it's so deep and powerful as some reviews stated. There was a few things that went wrong with Pi that I wont go into, but as with most filmmakers making no budget films all their mistakes suddenly become artistic expression. Anyway if you enjoyed Eraserhead or similar films like it then you cant go wrong with Pi 
Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie! It took me more than a dozen views to start figuring out how everything was connected. What's with the bugs? What's that stickey stuff in his mainfraim? How are his breakdowns and paranoia connected to his work, and what is the quite white place he ends up in? All the weird stuff is chaos slipping in between the seams, chaos which he thinks he's fighting against... at first. Max had a thread of a connection to the great infinite divine, that which human beings are not wired to see. He does see it though, glimpses at first, then the whole thing. It almost kills him. It's the classic Iccarus story, except that Max survives and finds happiness at the end. I disagree that the end is a 'cop out' or incongruous-- it is the cumulation of every frame of the film... it is the point! He looks at the leaves blowing in the trees, *doesn't* see a pattern, can't see a pattern, doesn't want to see a pattern-- and, for the very first time, he smiles. Why isn't it perfect? I would have like to see more actual math. The concepts are there, but the details aren't. Not a big deal. "A Beautiful Mind" put a lot of effort into putting real math into the plot, and I like that. Also, some of the details didn't connect. For example, the 'name of god' (216-letters long), and the 216-digit number his computer spits out before dying, wouldn't necessarily be connected. The system they explained indicated that different numbers of integers would represent a single letter in Hebrew. Like 42 would be a letter, and 2 would be different letter. So, the number of digits wouldn't really equal the number of letters... Darren kind of painted himself into a corner there. He wisely chose not to make the punch line of the movie a complex number theory proof, and I didn't even notice (much less become annoyed about) this detail until viewing #15. Up until then, every time I saw it something different would finally make sense. Thus, five stars. I'm inclined to give five stars to any movie that makes me think longer than the credits roll, so this one should get many many more. 
When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done. Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off - "A Beautiful Mind" 
This movie was really on track to be an earth shattering experience for us sci-fi geeks. Here's why: *creeped out techno music. not creepy and etherel in itself...but creeped out in the sense that everything is angled and black and white in contrast to the driving beat. it's incessant, and a great effect. Max's voice-overs add to the overall creepiness. *fantastic concept. brilliant, really. every pattern can be graphed. What if you could graph the pattern of nature and discover a secret "formula" to life? Max is in it to win it for the sake of knowledge...not $$$. Great stuff. *tons-o-suspense. the movie really builds up well. almost too well, as my one negative comment will show. you will get a really strong sense that SOMETHING of major importance is going to be revealed if you keep watching. *tripped out lead character...complete with hallucinations, quirkiness and the obligatory disdain for normal human contact. we're talking visions of brains that shriek and vibrating walls. The lead character is great...if not a little contrived at times by the actor. I mean, he's getting revelations to the meaning of life, the universe and everything by the swirling eddies in his coffee! YES! But, i only gave PI 4 stars for a reason: *the letdown. i mentioned that this movie makes you feel like it's building up to something so grand that it may even aid you in your own life. I mean, i was right there...hook line and sinker. But i was left on the line at the end. The ending isn't bad...but it seems like a cop-out. Max solves the problem by drilling a hole in his skull. No more special gift...no more math at the speed of thought...no more secret formula or mystery. Dang, i was disapointed. I tried really hard not to be, because the movie had me so enthralled...but I didn't get the "wham-bam" experience i was hoping for at the end. HOWEVER! I would HIGHLY recomend you checking it out for yourself. I've spoken with a lot of folks who totally disagree with me and dig the ending. Great addition to your underground sci-fi. Pick it up! ste 
The main character is a paranoid, out of order, lock in, mathamatician that never stops calculating. But hold on, there's more to the story. This guy is also an envelope pusher. When the movie starts, we realize that his character is not all together there. He has frequent headaches and nightmares. Could be due to his condition: when he was a little boy he stared up into the sun for a dangerous amount of time. the doctors say that his pupils dialated to the size of pin holes. But that's not what the story is about. The story is really about a set of numbers. No one really knows what it is. One says it's random computer junk. Another thinks it's part of a code. One thinks it could help figure out the stock market. A group of people think that it is a code for the actual name of God. The real insanity comes from just knowing that the code exsists. That's what the character goes through. If it is not a numerial code for good . . .could it be a numerial code for evil? Full of intrigue, suspense, and an interest in math. the movie is in full black and white. Really wierd camera angles as well as some messed up scenes. Soundtrack is also weird, like from the twighlight zone. Rent it, if anything else. Enjoy 
I must really commend the guys who put "Pi" together in that the subject matter is quite interesting. There were parts of the story that became obscured in the editing (I suspect) such as the role of the beautiful neighbor (Shekinah?) and it is never clear why our hero's double was standing opposite him on the subway platform with a bloody hand -- at that point, it became more of an self-concious artschool style film instead of focusing upon telling a story. The use of music in the film was almost a complete waste, it just did not work well. The creators needed to incubate this more, IMHO. I enjoyed the film best when it was telling a story, especially without the use of special effects. Still, it is an interesting film to see 
We have all wondered what would happen if the Alien and Predator met...head-to-head. This movie answers that question very well. No cheesiness. We have watched this movie so many times we have lost count, and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest. Great Saturday evening movie 
Until Alien v Predator, the best human/alien interaction was Danny Glover's encounter with the alien/hunter in Predator 2. It was a down to Earth (no pun intended) face off between the hunter and the hunted. But humans are predatory by nature... we love the hunt, the kill, the challenge. The aliens never stood a chance. Alien v Predator now introduces the acid bleeding aliens we all got to know and love from that series of movies, faced against these safari specialists with humans thrown in as a bonus. Some one fire up that grill! It's the perfect set up... three races of creatures all pitting their ability to survive against the other. No surpises though... the bad guys lose, the middle guys get a trophy and the humans win... for now. Just don't leave it this way for too long though. We need another episode! 
What a challenge ! To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as ï¿½ The Old Curiosity Shop ï¿½. So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonn 
I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5. In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films. The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series. It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it. I think they could pull off one more film. Ripley's a great hero. This movie was pretty bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects. I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien. Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money. The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent. Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement. This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
I don't care what people say, I got it right off the bat, what the movie was about I joy it as well .. Alien Predator .. kids,it worked just fine for me .. you got to love .. Predator ..kicking butt .. those cool look Aliens. It's fun watching I'll enjoy, years to come .. Calling Spaceship Earth .. Thank for the trip Thanks for dropping me at back home. Based more on Comic Books "Alien Vs. Predator" .. not so much on passed Alien Movies or Predator Movies. 
Theatrical Version: I thought it was stupid that they didn't stick to the R rated gore that the other Alien and Predator movies have, but thats ok. You get a fair ride that includes many refrences to the movies, but just doesn't deliver the excitment that Alien and Predator gave you. 3/5 Unrated Version: Not as gory as Alien and Predator but a big improvement over the theatrical version. The cuts are gorier, the chestbursters are gorier, and the dead bodies are more disgusting. 5/ 
I am laughing at those 2 star reviews saying how AVP is destroying the Alien and Predator legacy because of its nonexistent plot. All I am going to say is this: go back and watch Alien and P1 again before passing any judgment. I did recently. Both has even less of a story than AVP. Both would be receiving mediocre reviews if released today. Those 2 star reviewers are comparing AVP to how they remember Alien and Predator. Memories are doing a real number on them. The only thing that AVP lacks is originality. However, the story will continue. AVP1 sets the stage for sequels. We should wait and see how it develops. Meanwhile, enjoy the incredible CG and action sequences. In short, AVP is an awesome 90 minute thrill ride, that I am willing to take again and again. And for the record, Paul Anderson is a great director. Check out his "Resident Evil 1." As another side note, James Cameron ranked AVP as the 3rd best among the 5 Alien movies, after "Alien" and his "Aliens" 
This was a real eye opener. Due to Californias stringent air standards the auto makers were forced to enter into a venue that they were not happy with and ultimately would see the demise of. How sad to deprive the United States of this functioning technology due to the governments and auto makers refusal to support it (both with infrastructure and legislation). 
In a film that will make you angry and disheartened, director Chris Paine explores the ominous confluence of big business and government and their efforts to get rid of the electric car, which ten years ago, looked as though it was going to set the automotive world on fire. The reasons behind the electric car's disappearance include corporate collusion and greed, governmental spinelessness and oil company propaganda. This does documentary does an excellent job of laying out what actually happened. When General Motors terminated all leases of its fleet of fast, sleek EV's - the vehicle was never made available for purchase - the company ended up sending them to the crusher as Honda, Toyota and Ford also would pull their fleets off the streets. Determined to find out who ultimately was responsible stopping production, Paine cleverly structures his movie like a murder mystery, lining up the list of suspects and then methodically going through them. In addition to the car companies and obviously the oil companies, who have grown accustomed to selling nearly 3 billion gallons of gas a week, fingers are also are pointed at the California Air Resources Board, which backed off of its original Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate under pressure from the auto industry and the Bush Administration (go figure). While Paine, himself a one-time EV1 lessee, is unabashedly partial to the promise of electric-car technology over petrol, he includes interviewees who don't even agree a crime ever occurred and they argue that there was just lack of demand which ended the scant supply. Of course, oil companies ran ads claiming that the electric car was an environmental hazard and the public was just too shortsighted to see through the lies. Later, the oil companies and the car manufacturers bought the rights to the electric car battery technology. And as Paine gathers such converts as Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson, Peter Horton and Alexandra Paul who talk about the advantages of having the car and how great it actually was, we see the gradual collusion of corporate and government interests gradually unfold. Who Killed the Electric Car? makes a compelling case that the current discussion of hydrogen cell technology, as the successor to the internal combustion engine, but the movie also makes the point that hydrogen technology isn't nearly as efficient as electrical technology. The hydrogen cell is still decades away from being perfected, whilst the electric car was close to being practical - the cars were actually on the road! And although the film ends on an optimistic note - with the current popularity of hybrid vehicles - it's still upsetting to see all these new clean electric cars - a hope for the future - being crushed, mangled and shredded. Mike Leonard November 06. 
I saw this movie in the theater and I thought it was quite an eye opener. Some may say it shows an imbalanced view in favor of electric cars but what happened to kill the electric car was anything but balanced. The movie shows how car makers put a technological wonder on the road; a car that meets 90% of our motoring needs with little maintenance and no more trips to the gas station. It tells a story of how the car's inventors, with help from the oil industry and their combined influence over government, systematically raised doubts rather then educating on the virtues of the ground breaking technology. It left me sadly realizing that a player in the beleaguered US car industry had a head start against foreign competitors but eagerly wasted it 
I drove the EV1 for five years, so some might say I am not exactly objective on this subject. Be that as it may, this movie utterly demolishes GM's lame propaganda that nobody wants to drive an EV. GM fully *intended* the EV1 to fail; while it may have cost a billion dollars to develop, that was small potatoes compared to the value (to GM) of destroying California's zero-emission mandate and keeping it from spreading to other states. Despite extreme scarcity, highly restrictive lease terms and nearly non-existent advertising, the EV1 became an unexpected success. The unbridled enthusiasm of its drivers, splendidly depicted in this movie, so embarassed GM that they eventually recalled and destroyed every EV1 with a vindictiveness that stunned even those of us who thought we harbored no illusions about GM's motives. The EV1 may be dead, a victim of corporate greed and short-sightedness. But no one who has ever thought seriously about the subject can doubt that the EV will return; the only open question is *when*. Hopefully this movie will remain as an inspiration, and help make that day sooner rather than later 
This movie shows the travesty of the combustion engine, and the pity of the demise of the brilliant EV1 Electric Car. A fun movie for any thinking person who cares about the environment -- and a frustrating one too 
What a movie! Like Super-Size Me, An Inconvenient Truth, and Fahrenheit 9/11 , this one pulls at your intellect and gut to see many heros and villains, and expect justice. The premise? GM and other car manufacturers were making fully functional, 100% electric cars less than a decade ago. Then, with the California Air Resources Board decision to withdraw the requirement that 5-10% of cars sold in California pass the zero emissions test, and a possible behind the scenes conspiracy with a variety of players promoting the California Fuel Cell Partnership, the EV-1 and other electric cars die, literally. Hundreds of fully functioning cars were smashed and shredded. Zero of these original cars are on the road today. Zero! They had all been leased, and the auto companies called them all to car heaven, even though the folk leasing them offered cash to keep them. Do not let a single politician be elected without clarifying their role in this debacle. Never let your concerns for global warming, human health, and national security be held ransom by the gas and automobile cartels. It's up to you 
This movie exposed some serious problems with industry and government alike and demonstrated why we have made so little progress in reducing our dependence on oil. But it actually also exposed the general apathy that allows these problems to continue. As with the electric car, the movie itself did not generate much interest. Notwithstanding, it is a really interesting movie. It ties nicely with the title of "Who Killed the Electric Car?" by looking at the suspects which include: Car Companies, Oil Companies, Consumers, Government, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), Battery Technology, and Fuel Cells. The actions of GM in scrapping the electric car and destroying its remnants make it look sinister. And there appears to be a serious conflict of interest for a number of government officials who have had positions in the oil and auto industry. One interesting point in this movie is whether Fuel Cells will be really ever be viable. It raises the question as to whether the hype about Fuel Cells is really a diversion by the auto and oil industries to delay any real progress in developing a battery powered electric car which can effectively compete with gasoline powered cars. The movie questions the motives of the California Air Resources Board in eliminating its Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate, which required 2% of the vehicles sold in California to be emissions free by 1998 and 10% emissions free by 2003. Unbelievably, the Chairman of the California Air Resources Board subsequently became the chairman of the California Fuel Cell Partnership--which makes his actions that ultimately eliminated battery powered electric vehicles appear to be an incredible conflict of interest. This movie is thought provoking and easy to watch. Hopefully it will help inspire the comeback of the electric car. At least one small company, Tesla Motors, is now making a highly road worthy (albeit expensive at this point) electric car. 
This engrossing documentary surprises viewers on a number of levels and offers a broad range of interviewees and perspectives. Personally, as a grad student focusing on the nation's addiction to oil (the majority of which goes into personal transportation) I see "Who Killed the Electric Car?" as a film useful in propelling dialogue and motivating consumers to demand more from staid US automakers. Petroleum dependency, and all its attendant issues from securitizing oil reserves around the globe to environmental degradation, can be addressed with technology and leadership. As Dr. Stan Ovshinsky, inventor of NiMH batteries remarks in the film, ""If you want to change the world, don't grab a gun. Do what we do and change the world with science and technology. 
I bought the DVD for my daughter's 7th birthday. Both she and my 5yr old love the movie. They sing the songs from it all day long 
I'm not a big fan of Tom or Demi, and Jack even wears out his welcome in some films, but not here. The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years. I enjoy the script, because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force. 
The DVD is great. Lots of Subtitle options not to mention the fact that the Movie is just simply amazing with a great Cast 
Around a brutal and mysterious murder of a soldier, a young attorney will be sent to investigate this dark and bitter incident. A curious honor code seems to exist hovering the subordinates who will try to cover up all the clues with the only intention to preserve the moral and good costumes. But slowly the truth will make its glamorous appearance despite the efforts, leading to a trail where the confrontation among these two men: Tom Cruise as the good guy in search of the truth and Jack Nicholson as the obsessed man who, behind all his exhibited intolerance and nasty behavior will not be able to avoid -thanks to an admirable tricky game- to hide what was going on that horrid evening when the rules had to be broken in service of a distorted order, according the famous statement of The leopard `s Giovanni de Lampedusa: "Everything must change in order to remain unalterable" If Dr. Strangelove was a demolishing advertence, genially narrated about the miscarried conduct and deplorable evasion of the reality and transfer of guilty over imaginary events to justify his own fluids lacks; or in the case of "Apocalypse now" led us to the darkest corners of the febrile madness of a Colonel and all his command who lost the coordinates of the real world, "A few good men" recreates once more with admirable efficacy and detailed description, the pernicious and eccentric state of mind of a General, to whom the moral codes are handled according his own convenience, being able to transform and dislocate them according his doubtful points of view, the well known rules of the game. Powerful script, arresting camera angles and one of the most pyramidal performances of Jack Nicholson ever made of this film not only a cult movie, but a firm candidate among the ten best films of the Decade and obviously the masterpiece of Rob Reiner. 
I could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot/story of this movie is about. Or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film, and find out that way. Most of you probably know it by now, as it is. A Few Good Men is on my (and my wife's) list of Top Ten movies of all time....with plenty of good reasons. As it has been said in many other reviews, the acting in this film (from all the supporting actors as well) is excellent. The story is good too....very interesting, actually. It would be easy to look at this movie as simply a "blockbuster" kind of movie....which, essentially, it is. It's got A-list talent in front of, and behind the camera....it made a hell of alot of money at the box office, so yes it's a "blockbuster". But it's also a damn good story, as mentioned before. Another thing I liked about this movie, was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's characters....something most other films on this scale would have done. And I know it's been said in many other reviews, but I'm going to say it again anyway....Jack Nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie. No, not because of that famous "You can't handle the truth...." line. But because his acting really is that good. It seems so natural. His mannerisms are so natural, that he could pass for a real life military leader....I am in the military myself, so I can vouch for this. And even though this movie is over two hours, I was never once bored....you won't be either 
This is not a review of A Few Good Men, as such, but rather a review of its excellent director, Rob Reiner. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this movie...it's that good...and there's little point to my echoing the excellent reviews already posted here. But the other day I decided to watch the movie with the director's commentary on--something I rarely do because too often the directors/stars who do such commentaries yak on endlessly and wind up detracting from the movie rather than adding insight to it. Not so with the director's commentary of A Few Good Men. Reiner shows wonderful restraint at the same time he adds information which will enhance my future viewings of this movie. For example, even though I was aware of the fact the clear sexual tension between the Cruise and Moore characters is never allowed to reach (ahem) climax I was not aware this was a conscious choice on the part of the movie's makers. I credit them with good sense and good taste for that choice and will relish the absence of groping hereinafter. It might even help me to forget the memory lapses shown by Rob Reiner in his commentary: he cites the confrontation between Moore and Cruise at the softball practice as 'the first meeting between the two' (it was not...they actually met in her office earlier); and he credits the drill team which provides the spit-and-polish backdrop for the opening credits as having come from 'one of the North Carolina universities' (it was actually Texas A, according to the credits). But one fact, often repeated in this commentary, that will not be easily forgotten and will, I'm sorry to say, detract from my enjoyment of the movie in subsequent viewings is Reiner's confession that he saw an opportunity in the original broadway play to make a movie not so much about military life and military justice, but about the struggle of an intelligent and upwardly mobile young man trying to get out from under 'the shadow of a more famous father'. I find this rather sad. Certainly a great deal can be said of Rob's father, Carl Reiner, but I personally felt Rob had already 'made his mark' long before he directed A Few Good Men in '92. Yet, nearly 10 years after directing this excellent movie the man is still tied up in knots over this 'I've got to be better than my dad' trip. One can't help but wonder how much better (all the way to five stars?) a movie this might have been if Rob were more content to be his own man 
Sorry, after reading some negative reviews I just had to speak up. This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I still to this day watch it over and over again. Well directed, some of the best acting I have seen, and my god the cast in this movie, the list of stars is endless. The courtroom scenes were so intense, I envey anyone who has not seen this yet. The story was perfect and so many surprises and turns. Really well done. This movie is worth every penny, I just wish I would of got to see it in the movies. It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen, how can anyone say this movie was not good, I guess they just can't handle the truth.. 
As always with Amazon I recieved my purchase in perfect condition 
There are some great courtroom scenes in this movie that are so powerful and the acting is fantastic. The story of honor and pride in one's country and way of life is an inspiration for anyone who is a believer in truth, justice and the American Way 
The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as "code, honor discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few Good Men" 
This documenty will probably be the "darkest" DVD WWE will ever release because Jake Roberts himself is a very dark man. They hold nothing back here as they do deep into his life and every aspect of it which honestly, it's not safe for children and this DVD itself is something that should have been rated TV-MA. Pick Your Poison is an approprate title for this DVD set. The documentry starts with Jake Roberts story of growing up and dealing with problems abusing women, and going from home to home. Him getting into wrestling via his father Grizzly Smith and his early days in promotions are glossed upon all the way up to him getting involed in NWA Mid-Altantic Wrestling. Jake Roberts invention, the DDT, is talked about and the story of his it came to be. His time in Georgia Championship Wrestling along with his fued with Ronnie Garvin is touched upon before they move on to him going back to Mid-Alantic before quitting there as well. His debut in the WWE is talked about starting with his fued with him Damien "the snake" against Ricky Steamboat and his lizard including the DDT Ricky on the concrete from Saturday Night's Main Event. His interview segment "The Snake Pit" is talked about along with Jake's interview skills the fact that he never had to raise his voice to get his point across. His fued with Honky Tonk Man, how that started his drug addiction, and his match at WM3 with Alice Cooper is touched upon along with how he was a becoming a big star in the WWE. His fueds with Ted Dibiase over the Million $ Belt along with his real life wife's involvement with the Rick Rude fued are discussed. Here the docuementy starts to get more personal as Jake talks about his drug addiction. From there, stories are told about Damien the snake his fueds with Andre The Giant his fued with Earthquake which resulted in the "death" of Damien. Jake then goes into the backstage story behind his fued with Ultimate Warrior and how come nothing ever happened past the vignette's that were filmed. His fued with Randy Savage is glossed over before they go into the story of how he left WWE after WrestleMania 8. His brief history story behind his entrance exit in WCW was talked about before he returned to WWE a religious man...and how that faith planted the seeds for Austin 3:16. His fued with Jerry Lawler is discussed and how it personally effected him to the point to where he left WWE again. His appearence on Beyond The Mat was discussed along with his 30 second cameo at ECW's Hardcore Heaven '97 is talked about. The documentry closes out on Jake discussing stories that have been printed about him for the past couple of years and his appearence on RAW before WM21. Also on this disc are various interview outtakes where Jake talks about his relationship with children, how he became "The Snake", a meeting with NBC Executive Dick Ebersol, how he turned King Kong Bundy babyface, and why his fued with Hulk Hogan didn't go far. Other wrestlers speak on various subjects such as Hogan also giving his point of view in his short fued with Jake along with a hidden story about a drive with Jake's dad Grizzly Smith, other wrestlers speak on Grizzly, and Ricky Steamboat tells a story about Damien in the shower scaring the crap out of all the wrestlers in the locker room. The matches itself are split among the two disc: Disc one includes Ricky Steamboat in The Snake Pit match (basically no disqualification); his WrestleMania 3 match against Honky Tonk Man, a "Rude Awaking vs. DDT" match against Rick Rude. Disc two features a tag team match with Ricky Steamboat and matches against Ronnie Garvin, Lanny Poffo, Sting in a Coal Miner's Glove match (Halloween Havoc), Dirty White Boy, Steve Austin in the King Of The Ring final, Jerry Lawler at SummerSlam, and with Tommy Dreamer vs. Justin Credible Jack Victory at November 2 Remember '98. They also have vingette's featuring Earthquake "killing" Damien, Jake's cobra biting Randy Savage, his run-in during the Tommy Dreamer/Jerry Lawler match, a TNT interview, Rick Rude hitting on Cheryl Roberts, an interview with Mean Gene, two appearences on the Brother Love show, four Ulitmate Warrior promos, an promo featuring various snakes, and an hidden interviews featuring Ricky Steamboat and another one before his match with Ronnie Garvin. Rounding out this DVD set are 3 Snake Pit episodes featuring Kamala, JunkYard Dog, and Hulk Hogan. Overall, a great DVD collect for those who were fans of the legend and good for those who want to know about the effects of the "dark side" of the business 
There is not enough footage on the feud with Macho Man Randy Savage. I prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story. What did the Macho Man think about it? Unfortunately we can never get to hear from Ms Elizabeth. Would these be included in a future Macho Man DVD set? I was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy, especially in front of a huge live audience including kids. I was totally shocked when I first saw that on TV back in the 80's. Yes, that's hardcore. Deadly scary hardcore! That should not happen in the first place. The story involving Steamboat is well covered. It is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be. It is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing. There should be a line which should not be crossed. How can a real heavyweight guitar be used by Honky Tonk to hit Jake over the head? Human error? Hm... Nowadays Tripe H is using a hammer to hit others on the head. I guess a guitar is not a big deal by today's standard. Enough is enough. We don't need accidents! They may be an unevitable part of sports, but not part of "entertainment." 
I didn't think @ the time that they were going to release a DVD on Jake Roberts. But after I watched this the first time, I'm glad they did. First things first, Jake Roberts, no matter what kind of personal problems he may have had in the past, the guy is a TRUE legend. This DVD is as in depth as any WWE DVD I've recently purchased. It gave me certain information about Jake that I didn't previously know. The documentary portion of the DVD is awesome, and it's required viewing for all fans, especially long time fans like me. Here's my review on the extra matches: Disc One Matches vs. Ricky Steamboat, Snake Pit Match - The Big Event 8/28/86, ***1/2 (Jake and Steamboat had a great feud around this time, and this is one of the highlights of that feud. One of Jake's best matches.)  vs. Honky Tonk Man - Wrestlemania III 3/29/87, *1/2 (Still a shocking upset to this day, Honky Tonk beat Jake in this match, still watchable though.)  vs. "Ravishing" Rick Rude, Rude Awakening vs. DDT Match - MSG 10/24/88, ** (Another great feud during this time for Roberts. Rude was after Jake's wife @ the time, and the result was a HOT storyline, Jake got the win in this one.) Snakes Bites (Extras) Jake's relationship with children How he became "The Snake" Working with Dynamite Kid Legion of Doom "Steamboat saved my life..." Meeting Dick Ebersol "Snake" on the loose... Grizzly Smith Hogan/Jake Feud Easter Eggs on Disc One In the Chapters section, click right twice on "Growing Up" for Jake telling a personal story about being worked by his father after a match In the Snake Bites section, click right twice on "Legion of Doom" for a clip of Animal finishing the story he started about King Kong Bundy on the Snake Bites clip In the Snake Bites section, Click left twice on "Grizzly Smith" for a clip of Hulk Hogan talking about an experience he had with Jake's father on a road trip. Disc 2 - Matches: w/ Ricky Steamboat vs. Jim Nelson Mike Miller - Mid-Atlantic, 9/9/81, *1/2 (Average match, but watchable.)  vs. Ronnie Garvin, World TV Title - Georgia Championship 12/3/83, ** (Not a bad match, but they did show some energy in this one.)  vs. "Leaping" Lanny Poffo - MSG 3/16/86, *1/2 (Jake's debut match in the WWF. Pretty average to say the least.)  vs. Earthquake - Superstars 4/27/91, (No match. Once things appear to get going, Earthquake "squashes" Jake's snake in the bag, actually sitting on it.)  After a match, Jake "The Snake" Roberts attacks Randy "Macho Man" Savage with a cobra - Superstars 11/23/91 vs. Sting, Coal Miners Glove Match - Halloween Havoc 10/25/92, *1/2 (Another fairly average match. Worth a look to see Jake face Sting for the first last time.)  vs. Dirty White Boy, Smokey Mountain Title - Smokey Mountain Wrestling 5/7/94, * (Not very good, but semi-ok.)  vs. "Stone Cold" Steve Austin - King of the Ring 6/23/96, ** (If it wasn't for this match, there would be no Stone Cold Steve Austin, bottom line. Watch Austin's promo @ the end of this match.)  vs. Jerry "The King" Lawler - Summerslam 8/18/96, DUD (Pretty much a squash almost, Jake quickly disposes of Lawler with the DDT.)  Run-in during Tommy Dreamer vs. Jerry "The King" Lawler - Hardcore Heaven 8/17/97  w/ Tommy Dreamer vs. Justin Credible Jack Victory - November 2 Remember 11/1/98, ** (This is your standard ECW match.) Interviews Promos: Vince McMahon interviews Jake - TNT 3/14/86 "Ravishing" Rick Rude hits on Cheryl Roberts - Superstars 4/23/88 Brother Love interviews Jake Cheryl Roberts - Wrestling Challenge 1/27/90 Promo about threatening Ted Dibiase with snakes - Superstars 3/3/90 Fights with Brother Love during interview - Superstars 10/27/90 Interview on The Barber Shop - Wrestling Challenge 5/11/91 Ultimate Warrior Casket Vignette - Superstars 8/3/91 Ultimate Warrior Cemetery Vignette - Superstars 8/10/91 Ultimate Warrior Snake-Filled Room Vignette - Superstars 8/17/91 Mean Gene Okerlund interviews Jake - Superstars 3/14/92 The Snake Pit: w/ Kamala, The Wizard Kim Chee - Wrestling Challenge 9/6/86 w/ Junkyard Dog - Wrestling Challenge 10/18/86 w/ Hulk Hogan - Wrestling Challenge 11/22/86 DVD Bonus: Excerpts from various books by WWE Legends including: Superstar Billy Graham "Tangled Ropes", Jerry Lawler "It's Good to Be the King... Sometimes" Freddy Blassie "Listen, You Pencil Neck Geeks"! Disc 2 Easter Eggs Click left twice on "with Ricky Steamboat vs. Jim Nelson and Mike Miller" for a Steamboat and Roberts promo regarding this match. Click right twice on "vs. Ronnie Garvin" for a Gordon Solie interview of Paul Ellering and Jake Roberts from Georgia Championship Wrestling. Cleck left twice on "vs. Earthquake" for a clip from Superstars on April 6th, 1991 where Roberts spooks Tenta and Jimmy Hart with the snake Overall, I have a few comments: #1) If you want this DVD for the matches ONLY, and you're looking for quality and you're not into the old school wrestling, this DVD is not for you. #2) If you're a nostagic fan, such as myself, and you like the classic WWF footage and matches to boot, high recommendation. #3) If you're just a fan of Jake Roberts, overall, another high recommendation. In the end, you won't go wrong with this purchase 
This DVD really lets you in on the insight of Jake Roberts. He was one of the most unique characters in his heyday and with his commentary on this it really stands out tremendously. The kind of things I learned from him (especially in his youth) and his drug and alcohol abuse, he grew up rough in every sense of the word. Now I have a better understanding of why/how he became bitter (at times). Overall, it's an excellent DVD that has most of his classic matches. When I first saw him get hit with the guitar by the Honky Tonk Man, I thought he was faking the shot to make it look real and I even laughed at it until he said that guitar was 1/2 inch thick and then I looked at the clip again and I thought damn, it really almost killed him. He had a lot of guts to continue to wrestle. That type of commentary along with other things he touched up on really gave it a sense of realism of the pro wrestling lifestyle. Overall, I recommend this DVD to add to your collection. 
Awesome DVD! Jake Roberts tells you everything from origin of the DDT to the drug addiction to the last time he appeared on WWE television. This is definitely a must have! Jake the Snake is a true legend and deserves to in the Hall of Fame. Maybe it will happen in 2006 
At first I wasn't going to buy this dvd. I didn't really care or know a whole lot about the career of Jack Roberts. Then I saw it Used at a local Game Stop store. For $11 I couldn't refuse. The doc. is GREAT, I knew that he does or did drugs, I learned alot about the Man and his hard up bringing. As for the extras there are tons I found three or four hiddden easter eggs. If you can find this Used BUY IT. 
A stroll down memory lane, with one of the most interesting wrestlers. By far, it was worth 5 stars. If I had any complaint, it would be be overuse of the "younger Jake" double drinking at the bar and popping pills. A few times got the point across. They could have used that time to throw in a couple more Snake Pit segments as extras. No one is ever happy with all the matches presented, of course, or all the footage. The only two bits I would have liked to see was that blindfolded versus blindfolded Rick Martel and Jake Roberts match, and also footage from the one Saturday Night's Main Event, when Honky Tonk Man dressed as Kimchi and attacked Jake, but then later, at the end, when Jake got his revenge with Damion. Still, excellent fun! My only other question now is, where the hell is a ROWDY RODDY PIPER DVD? 
The first time I watched In Good Company I said to myself, eh not good, not bad, just pretty average. A couple reviews reflect that. But ever since HBO started playing the movie constantly I find myself watching it more and more and enjoying it more and more. The best quality about this film is that it's real. You watch the story progress and you feel like you're watching reality. I never found myself saying, how unrealistic, that could never happen. The character's emotions seem real, the situations seem real. That all points to a well-acted, well-written film. Also, the movie doesn't try too hard. It doesn't go out of its way to be funny, doesn't go out of its way to give you a sappy, predictable ending or stupid scenarios that so many movies end with. Just an interesting plot that flows and moves along with realism in mind instead of Hollywood fantasy 
Not a typical no brainer movie. This movie presents complex people with complex motives. Topher Grace is effective as the successful executive who can impress top ranking executives, yet has an undeveloped personality in many ways. He is still trying to find out who he is and what he wants in life. This lack of maturity and goals costs him his wife. He focuses on his job even though he isn't passionate about the work. Quaid does not like his demotion, yet he tries to be fair to his new boss and doesn't try to sabatoge him. This is where the film differs from other, inferior movies. He is unhappy about his new status but tries to make the best of it. He even tries to help his new boss. The love story is played with honesty since Quaid's daughter is too young to commit hereself to anyone, yet she's attracted to her dad's new boss. Don't expect cheap laughs and simple answers 
I first saw this in the theatre because I like Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson. I had never really seen Topher Grace outside of 'That 70's Show' which I never kept up with on a regular basis. I fell in love the movie first time I saw it and bought it soon after it came out on DVD. Mr. Grace plays a 26 year-old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend. He's become such a machine in a competivie world that he's loses his way in life. I was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too. One of mentor's has told me repeatedly that the mid-twenties can be one of the roughest times in life. So many things are going at once on so many levels. To me, this movie captured that. Paul Weitz did a great job writing this. The cast was exquisite 
I always this dislike those raunchy humor comedies(always with some expections like Harold and Kumar), many to list but In Good Company is a very original movie and fits perfectly as comedy and drama there is never a dull or slow moment in the whole movie all the chacters are likeable,Topher is a pretty good actor and he has a great future as a comedian(by the way i think Topher is a great choice for Eddie Brocks in Spider-man 3)he is very funny in "That 70 Show" too, Scarlett was excellent(i never see a bad movie from her), with no dobut one the best young actress in the actual hollywood,the story is great and original,drama works fine the direction also is very good and the movie skips any raunchy joke,in my opinion In Good Company by far is one the best comedies i ever seen and one my favorites comedies too,i gonna buy my copy!  acting: 10/10 direction: 10/10 story 10/10 Overall 10/1 
Dennis Quaid ranks high in our family video night; both the Parent Trap and the Rookie are among our young children's favorites. For my wife and I, I rented In Good Company due to Quaid, and because the film intrigued me: its trailer and synopsis do not rely on quick action or screwball comedy.... it was different from most of what I see. In Good Company relies on its characters. I don't know the corporate world, but as corporations seem to be today's "Resident Evil" (pun intended), I liked a story where a heart is found in the Oz less world of layoffs and cubicles. What I liked most was the interaction between Dan Forman, played by Quaid, and Carter Duryea, played by Topher Grace. Carter is fatherless; basically he's parentless, and the film shows a close Foreman family but has little, and little positive, reference to Carter's upbringing. Carter's world is psyche, synergy, cell phones and Sports America, where he now runs sales. As the film progresses we are treated not just to an old school/new school, hip/over the hill tension, but see a young man learn character, in work and family, from someone who has done it right. There are limitations, as when Foreman tells Duryea that the secret to a good marriage is to find the right woman and keep your organ in your pants when you are away from home. This is not too helpful for Carter, whose seven-month marriage to the wrong woman shows a need for more than luck. But overall he learns that life is more than suits, cars, and success... he longs for he does not have. Throughout we see the pain of a young man all alone in the world, someone who has had no one to guide him. In one scene, Morty, played by David Paymer, states that the right timing is important. The film could easily have dived into a happy ending where everyone has a job and where Carter gets the girl, but it makes a good move by remaining true to that line. When Carter hugs Foreman goodbye he squeezes him and breaks down. When we next see Carter he is jogging outside rather than on a treadmill. He may not know where his path will lead, but now, thanks for Dan Foreman, he is no longer running in circles. 
Upon seeing previews at the theater for In Good Company, my first instinct was to avoid it like the plague. Based on the apparent target demographic for this film, it was marketed horribly. The trite title and kitchy manner in which the preview clips were edited reminded me too much of those shallow adoloescent throwaway Disney films - the type hollywood routinely pukes out for 14 year old girls. And knowing Dennis Quaid's penchant for appearing in such films, I assumed In Good Company was another one of those. Recently however, I stumbled across the movie's opening credits on HBO. "I'll stay long enough to make fun of it.", I thought to myself. But in a matter of minutes, I was completely sucked in. The writing was intelligent and the tone often dark. This is a movie that, on the surface appears to be a natural born comedy, yet it resists the obvious cornball pitfalls at every turn. The characters are not 1 dimesnional buffoons, but are written to be very believable people with real problems. Every time I smelled a cliche or overly sentimental twist coming, the film continued to surprise me by not taking the easy way out. Is it a perfect film? No. In Good Company is not without its flaws. But they are very few and very forgivable. This one is proof that you can't judge a DVD by its cover 
In Good Company isn't a hilarious comedy, nor a serious, "edge-of-your-seat" drama - yet something about it made it one of the most absorbing movies of 2005, pleasantly fascinating and easy to watch. The story is about a middle-aged sales exec (Dennis Quaid) who's company is sold, with over-night demotion and a new boss (Topher Grace), a young whipper-snapper half his age and pathetically callow, though exuding infectious confidence and ambition of youth. The new boss even naively falls for his older worker's daughter, oblivious to the obvious impracticality.  So without a lot of hilarious comedy nor a suspenseful plotline, what makes In Good Company so interesting? Two things I think. One, the movie starts out with a premise that lends itself to extremely cynical comedy (like the Simpsons), but very realistically and gradually rises above that temptation to a conclusion that's uplifting in spite of the realistic situation. Second, the unusual platonic chemistry between the two male leads seems real and strangely appealing, like you want to know these people and root for their friendship. You don't see that done well in the movies often, and this is probably the most effective case since Cary Grant and Ronald Coleman in Talk Of The Town (in which they were in a romantic triangle with Jean Arthur, so it's really not the same situation). I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the movie to see what I mean 
I loved this movie. The acting was great and the their interactions throughout the movie interesting. Its amazing how some movies just don't have the ability to keep my interest but this one definitely pulled me in right from the start and built as the movie progressed. Very enjoyable and with some good laughs. 
I wanted to see a movie one evening, and it really didn't matter what movie, I just wanted to get out of the house, and get to a theater. I looked at the listings and decided to see "In Good Company", and I'm certainly glad I did. I found this movie to be very entertaining, and very enjoyable to watch. I thought this movie really showed a new edge to Scarlett Johansson as well. In a way this movie was also an eye-opener on todays' corporate America, and its' all too often pitfalls. Nicely produced, acted, and directed. 
"In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise. If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two. I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced. Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling. Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
These are not the original theatrical realeases. In addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films, American Cinematographer noted in their review of the DVD release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels. Though they are an impressive technical achievement, I'll be buying the academy award winning films that I saw when I was younger 
The Star Wars Trilogy are my favorite movies of all time, to be able to own the first edition of it's DVD release is a Star Wars fan's dream come true 
These films look really good cleaned up, only thing George shouldn't of changed/added was the Greedo/Han scene in episode 4, the Han walking over Jabbas tail scene in episode 4, and the change to the end scene in episode 6 at the end where yoda, obi-wan, and anakin are all standing together smiling at luke. Replacing the old darth vader with the actor from episode 3 was just plain out dumb. 
my favorite movie is starwars trilogy. it is about the dark side and the good side. It takes place in the future. It is set in space. I liked it because it has action and love. It is also funny and is cool. All people would like the movie because it is about science and space. I give it a thumbs up 
NOTE: This review is not about the trilogy (which is great). This review is about the many DVD releases. The worst thing that ever happened to George Lucas is when Peter Jackson released the Extended Version of LOTR. Jackson showed fans we could demand, expect, and receive more from Hollywood. The impact of Peter Jackson sent shock waves among fans, who released a four-disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time. Even old Hollywood guards, like Ridley Scott and James Cameron (no surprise they are not Americans) took notice and improved their DVD releases. This change has been powerful, except in the case of Lucas and to some degree his pal Steven Spielberg, who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers. The many re-releases shows greediness, stubbornness, and lack of respect for fans. No one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version, but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality. In addition, please stop using the "Limited Edition" you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of Star Wars; it is both false and tiring. Release these films in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release. Lucas's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his Star War movies. Unfortunately, his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar. His shady practice of video/DVD releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him. One must wonder what went through Lucas mind when Peter Jackson won an Academy Award for Best Director and not him. Maybe if he focus on making quality films (like he once did) and not playing the DVD re-re-re-release game, then he could win one. 
Anyone whose read my previous "Star Wars" reviews know I've been very hard with George "Whore of Hollywood" Lucas and the whole direction he took the first trilogy on. I don't care if it WAS reflective of his "original vision," I get the feeling we'll need another prequel to figure out just what the Heck was going on (Is that what he MEANT to do? Who knows?). I was also a kid when the first trilogy came out and absolutely loved it. And yet, I think folks are being a LITTLE too critical of the changes made in this DVD set. Honestly, I also liked the updated special effects on the cinematic reissues for the 25th (I think) anniversary. So let's get the crap out of the way. The changes Lucas made FOR the DVD - necessary? Some yes, some no. It was nice to see Ian McDiarmid being the emperor in "Empire Strikes Back" (sorry, Mr. Revill. I at least hope you still get royalties), and the script rewrites make more sense now given what we know of the backstory. But still, but still....we didn't need Boba Fett's dialogue redubbed. We also didn't need even MORE stormtroopers for Han Solo to run away from. Another thing that, not only we didn't need, but was unnecessary and puzzling - replacing Sebatian Shaw at the end of "Return of the Jedi" with Hayden Christiansen. Why? And why not replace Alec Guinness with Ewan Macgregor to make it a matched set? My biggest complaint is with other "Star Wars" veterans; why didn't Lucas include the cleaned-up originals with the altered ones? I guess we all know the answer to this one, but it bothers me still. The changes, however, are minor and don't get in the way of the goodness that are the original trilogy of films. The bonus disc is a nice touch as well, bringing the sheer joy of behind-the-scenes goodness up to date with what made him famous. It was good to see they added and expanded on "Empire of Dreams," since they showed a version of it first on A One doesn't get the feeling of reheated leftovers that sometimes accompanies a DVD which throws an EPK or "HBO Behind-The-Scenes" doc as a "special feature." Add in the commentary (good overall), great still galleries, and excellent promo spots (it was way cool to see the TV ad for "Star Wars" I remember back again), and it's a good buy. I hope, though, that Mr. Lucas resists putting out any more "special limited editions." Oh, well, one can hope 
This isn't the original theatrical versions, but the later, computer enhanced "special editions." That makes me just a little sad; One of the great things about those original editions was finding how many bloopers you could spot. Who could forget Luke Skywalker landing his X-Wing after blowing up the Death Star and shouting "CARRIE" (not LEIA) at the top of his lungs?! The special editions got rid of all that great, human, trivia. Still, I've purchased this trilogy as a gift for my daughter and a trip down nostalgia lane for me. When the movie first came out I really didn't pay much attention to it. It's probably hard for younger audiences to believe, but "Star Wars" was originally a largely underground hit. The studio didn't mount any massive ad campaign for it and it's popularity grew mostly through word of mouth. As the film was literally entering it's last week of release, a friend took me to the Central City Mall (now defunct) in San Bernardino to see it. Like most others, I was stunned by the opening graphics. The pan from the surface of Tatooine to the small diplomatic ship to the huge Star Destroyer in blazing pursuit was inspired and effectively changed science fiction films forever. It would be years before I saw the original Star Wars again. (Remember, this was before you could see any movie and be sure that it would be released on VHS or DVD in less than six months.) So, Star Wars fans had to wait for years (well, at least two - my memory fails me) for "The Empire Strikes Back." To me, this was (and is) the best of all the Star Wars films. I saw this one at least a dozen times. The mini-adventure that launches "Empire" (Luke attacked by the Wampa and using the force to kill it; Han venturing out in the face of certain death to rescue his friend, and so on) became a Spielberg trademark, but Lucas did it here, first. These introductory vignettes have since gone on to become a staple of the action-adventure genre, showcased at their best in the "Indiana Jones" trilogy. The sudden - and unexpected - sexual tension in the triangle of Luke, Leia, and Han made this movie instantly provocative and riveted my teenaged attention. In the original Star Wars, the suggestion was that Luke and Leia were an "item." Putting Han into the mix was an inspired twist. Of course, the revelation that Darth was Luke's father (and Leia's brother) made this an instant soap-opera hit. Those were happy days, idyllic in hindsight, when all you had to worry about was how long you had to stand in line and whether or not you could get the perfect seats - center aisle, a few rows back - and revel in the newly released THX sound, following the plot so closely that you could (literally) quote the dialog along with the film! I still have my VHS copy of "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back" and I drag them out from time to time, just to remember days gone by. Just for the record, I still feel that "Return of the Jedi" was the weakest of the three - it felt like George was tired of the series and just wanted to tie up all the loose ends. When I finally get the DVD's, er, that is, borrow them from my daughter, it's going to feel a little strange to be sitting in my den with a 50 inch HDTV listening to THX grade home-theater But I believe a little of that earlier magic will still come through 
This trilogy is great. I wished I got this when it first came out. This trilogy DVD box set is worth every penny you put in to it. It's like watching the todays Star Wars movies!!!!!!!!!!!! 
If you LOVE "Sixteen Candles" this should be part of your library as a true CLASSIC. If you've never seen SIXTEEN CANDLES - this is a MUST SEE - and you'll want to see it more than once. With so many sight gags, excellent character acting and direction, and a happy ending to boot, you'll want this one in your DVD Library to enjoy over and over 
I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I laugh as hard at this in my 40s as I did in my 20s, it's just a hysterically funny flick! 
This isn't the type of movie that will make you reflect and question your life's ambitions, it's designed to make you laugh. I think it succeeds admirably. Molly Ringwald is perfect as the budding teenager ready to have life meet her full-force. She is surrounded by a quirky, forgetful family (complete with a jerk for a younger brother), nerdy boys desperate for her attention, good friends with whom she can be herself, and (naturally) a love interest. Anthony Michael Hall's character is as funny a dorky kid as I've ever seen...his dance moves are legendary! He has several monologues that still bring out genuine laughs from me, even after all these years of watching this classic. This is a teen movie, so go in with your expectations at that level and you may be pleasantly surprised that you enjoy watching this movie for years to come 
Molly Ringwald stars in this classic movie about coming of age and high school crushes. Ringwald stars as Samantha. Her sixteenth birthday just happens to be the day before her sister's wedding. Unfortunately for Sam, everyone has forgotten about her birthday due to the stress of the upcoming wedding. Sam's house is overflowing with relatives who have come in from out of town to attend the wedding. Both sets of grandparents have arrived, and Sam has been kicked out of her room. One set of grandparents have brought along a Chinese foreign exchange student whom they have been sponsoring. His name is Long Duc Dong (Gedde Watanabe). Sam's grandmother seems to think it would be a good idea for Long to accompany Sam to her school dance, so off they go. Meanwhile, Sam is being pursued by "the geek", played by Anthony Michael Hall. He has been coming on very strong, but its all an act to be cool in his friends' eyes. Sam has a crush of her own. His name is Jake Ryan (Justin Henry). Sam revealed her feelings about Jake on a "sex test" that one of her friends gave her. Jake gets ahold of the test and immediately becomes intrigued with meeting Sam. However, he's dating the most popular girl in the school, but, according to Jake, all she likes to do is party. True to her form, she organizes a huge party at Jake's house, only to get so drunk that she passes out. Jake asks the geek to drive her safely home, but more happened than just driving. Will Jake and Sam end up together? Will Sam's parents realize that they forgot her birthday? I can remeber seeing this movie when I was in high school, and its just as I remember it. Gedde Watanabe's portrayal of Long Duc Dong is the highlight of the movie. John and Joan Cusack even have bit parts. The cool soundtrack of great 80s songs is excellent as well. I highly recommend this movie. The acting is very good, especially by Hall and Watanabe, and the story is very funny. I'm sure that many people have had their family forget their birthday. Watch this funny film about growing up. Long Duc Dong will keep you laughing, too! 
This movie was great. I loved it! One of the best movies from the 80's! 
This movie is fantastic. It should be mandatory on everyones dvd list. It's so funny and fun and it stars two of the best from the 80's brat pack - Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. Molly Ringwalds character, Samantha, is about to turn 16 just at the exact same time her older sister is about to get married. In all the commotion, her birthday is forgotten and ruined. Her grandparents (so cute) come to stay at their house and bring along a hilarious Asian exchange student with them. She is forced to go along to the school dance (and take the exchange student with her) and there at the dance, Anthony Michael Hall (king of the nerds) has a wager with his nerd friends (including a very young John Cusack) that he can get her pants by the end of the night and will show them to all the nerds in the bathroom. There is actually a very tender scene in a car at the 'car workshop' classroom where he and Sam have a bit of a heart to heart. She reveals her secret crush (Jake - the hottest guy in school). One thing leads to another and the rest of the movie is spent with the 'will they, won't they get together'. With a predictable ending (albeit happy and fun), this is a great movie that I never get tired of. Long Duc Dong (the exchange student) steals every scene he is in. He is so funny (fans of ER got to see him again as he had a minor role each week for a long while back). This is a cool movie that I highly recommend because it's absolutely great and to me, it will always be a classic 
This is a classic teen romantic comedy from 1984. Hard to believe it is now 22 years old as of 2006! Molly Ringwald is mad for Jake whose dating the womanly Caroline while a geek pursues Molly. Sweet Sixteen is Sour Sixteen as her family forgets her birthday and her older sister's wedding eclipses everything. It still seems relevant now that we are all into the late 20's/early 30's.... and makes many of us sigh with relief that we are long gone from high school and never to return 
Set it middle America in the mid 1980s, SIXTEEN CANDLES is the story of Samantha Baker and the day she turned 16. Written by first time director, John Hughes and starring then teen queen Molly Ringwald, this is a must-see DVD for anyone who appreciates coming of age films. Almost like a modern day Jane Austen and the recent films that are based on her novels (Clueless), Hughes and SIXTEEN CANDLES successfully depict timeless teenage predicaments that anyone who has ever been young can relate to. SIXTEEN CANDLES takes place over the course of two days, which includes the long-awaited 16th birthday of a suburban teenage girl, whose family is too overwhelmed by their oldest daughter's pending nuptials the next day to remember the lead character's rite of passage birthday. With a soundtrack of new wave music, SIXTEEN CANDLES perfectly captures life in suburban American during the 1980s. The cast includes Anthony Michael Hall, who plays a nerdy guy who hero-worships Ringwald's character; Justin Henry, the hunky senior whom Samantha has a crush on; and John and Joan Cusack who in small roles, play random geeky high school kids on the outskirts of the popular crowd. There are also great performances by the two sets of grandparents who horrify Samantha Baker and the Chinese exchange student who accompanies her to a school dance. Though I have seen and enjoyed this film many times since it was first released, with older eyes and ears, I am somewhat shocked by the scene where Jake Ryan (the hunk) allows his drunken girlfriend to be pretty much raped by the Anthony Michael Hall character. In these politically correct times, I doubt this scene would ever be included in a mass-market film. Still by masterfully capturing teen insecurities, SIXTEEN CANDLES is a fantastic film that will long be remembered as Ringwald's finest work. Though Hughes went on to even greater directorial success in the wildly popular "Home Alone," in many ways this is a better representation of his genius, if for no other reason because it offers a timeless take on the complicated, distressing lives of teenagers. - Regina McMenami 
"Sixteen Candles" was the first film collaboration between John Hughes and Molly Ringwald and started a very profitable franchise for both Ms. Ringwald and Mr. Hughes. Ringwald stars as Samantha "Sam" Baker, a teen who is turning sixteen, unfortunately for her at the same time her spoiled, indulged and fairly shallow older sister Jenny (Blanche Baker) is getting married. Sam wakes up on her birthday, expecting her body to blossom and everything to be roses. Unfortunately, her own family forgets and it appears that she is going to have a miserable birthday. Additionally, the nerdy "Farmer Ted" (Anthony Michael Hall) has developed a crush on Sam, while Sam pines away for dreamy Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), who is quite involved with the pampered princess Caroline (Havilland Morris). What makes this movie such a staple for any 80s fan is not just the John Hughes/Molly Ringwald connection, but the appearance of Anthony Michael Hall, John Cusack (in a small, but early, film role), the unforgettable Long Duck Dong and the sympathy shown to Sam's plight. Who didn't have a crush on the most unobtainable guy in high school? Who didn't pine away for that senior, who seemed to have it all, including the perfect girlfriend? What girl didn't go thru high school awaiting that "perfect" sixteenth birthday? Sam's problems are all-important to her, as with most teens, but Hughes doesn't gloss over it or make them seem trivial. He sympathizes with Sam's plight and the plight of teen girls everywhere, whose biggest tragedy is not getting that car for their sixteenth birthday, or that popular guy not being interested in them. In keeping with Hughes' later films, all of the action is over the course of a day or two, so the "problems" are fairly quickly resolved. Perhaps not highly realistic, but more satisfactory. Also not highly realistic, in most teen worlds, is the incredibly decent and moral character of the oh-so-popular Jake Ryan. Would any other popular guy, upon intercepting a note naming him as Sam's biggest crush, keep that to himself? Would he really want to dump his popular, sexually active, girlfriend because he wants more than a party? Maybe not in reality, but in a teen girl's dream world, this is EXACTLY what would happen. And so, ultimately, "Sixteen Candles" is a fantasy film - - a fantasy that teen girls everywhere in the 80s ate up and made Molly Ringwald their poster girl. Highly recommended for a nostalgic look back at Molly, Anthony Michael Hall, a young John Cusack and the adorable Michael Schoeffling. 
This is some juicey stuff alright! The women are very much the MILF material that most men dream about. And it seems like they have no limit to their appetites for trouble... Like they have absolutely no moral consiousness... And that there is no limit to their stupidity... All of which makes for great drama -- and especially great free television. When you can watch it on DVD without commercials, it is sooooo worth it 
i am waiting for the 3rd season... i am married with 2 children and i can see my thinkings, way of life , my ex loves in side the movie... thank 
The first few episodes were a bit dragging but eventually it picked up and the story became very interesting and funny. It is indeed very entertaining and you can not wait for the next episode, not to mention, season 
this is a very good tv show you have to hava it 
Rumour had it that the second season was weaker than the first. Don't believe the hype : there's more dark secrets, reversals of fortune, crazy laughs and heart-breaking situations in these 24 episodes of a series that took the TV world by surprise. Crazy cameos (Ryan O'Neal, Maria Conchita Alonzo), new neighbors, and Bree going down at high speed : TV series has never been that good since... "6 Feet Under", maybe ? All hail to the creator, (Mark) Cherry on top ! Olivier Cachi 
I like this series since the begging, it's my guilty pleasure. I'm always wondering what the desperate characters are going to do next. I do recomend buying this box set and to watch Disk Number 6, with all the insight and deleted scenes, you are going to love it 
If you've viewed Season One, and liked it (and you must have-otherwise why would you even consider buying Season 2)you will enjoy this second dvd. Though the first season was [to me] much more interesting and action packed, probably because it was new and a fresh idea, this season's storylines continue to make surprise twists and turns. Just to watch Eva Longoria's and Marcia Cross's characters get what they want, one way or another makes this a worthy purchase. Not a learning experience, but excellent mindless entertainment!! 
The item ordered came way ahead of the scheduled date...in excellent condition. Will do business with you over and over again. 
It's hard to describe this great show. It has everything, comedy, suspense, drama, mystery, love stories, but at the very core is a deep affection that binds all the women to each other. They fight and argue but they are always there for each other when the chips are down 
loved this season. always keeps me on the edge of my seat. cant wait for season three to come out onto dvd 
one of my favorite comedies next to caddyshack and pee wee herman's big adventure. everytime i watch this film, it cracks me up while i reminise about my days in st. louis in the early 90s. i haven't seen one white person in this movie. and that's what i love about it. it's an all-black comedy that is one of the funniest movies ever created 
I first watched Friday on VH1 and on Comedy Central, both however were edited, the DVD allowed me to see more of the Movie, I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining movie 
Every day is friday when you have no job...funny good make you have a good laugh at the end of the da 
Looking forward to watching this movie.Rated R for pervasive strong language and drug use,and for a brutal fight 
This movie is silly at best, racist at worse. I can't believe Ice Cube actually wrote the script for this mess. My opinion of Ice Cube has been drastically lowered. It's the old black jiving and shucking all over again. This movie has all the classic black stereotypes. It even has a scene where Smokey gets so high that he ends up in the chicken coop thinking he's a chicken. Remember the old minstrel shows?: "nobody in here but us chickens." There's no plot to speak of, just a bunch of insults, getting high, stealing money, potty jokes, black people knocking each other upside the head. Some character get punched out, and Smokey (Chris Tucker) goes over and yells in his face, "Dude, you been knocked out!" That's a typical "joke" from this movie. How about a dogcatcher getting bit on his behind by a dog? Hilarious---Not. After watching this dvd with my family, we tried to think of one funny or worthwhile scene, and we couldn't think of a single one. 
Even if it's not necessarily the clean kind. I must say that I was slightly skeptical about how much I'd enjoy this movie but it turned out to be far better than expected. It is a mix of humor and drama wherein the humor outweighs everything else. Friday is very unique as the characters stand above the generic ones Hollywood usually offers. Ice Cube is great and plays a straight man to Chris Tucker's Smokey. The best parts of the film are when Tucker speaks. He has hilarious line after another. The one thing I had to disagree with, as far as the descriptions of this movie go, is that it is devoid of any moral element. This isn't a typical stoner celebration of weed because only after Ice Cube smokes the smoke does everything really fall apart for him. He nearly ruins his chance with a girl he really likes and then...well, I won't give any of the plot away. Yet, his dad's insistence that there is never a reason to use a gun turns out to be valuable advice, and, should any kids who see this film reflect on it, hopefully they'll reconsider "pulling out the nine" should they be stared down by their own Deebo's. Who knows? Even if it affected only one person it'd be worth it. A pleasant surprise overall 
i own all three movies in the series, and this one is simply the best. this is the breakthrough performance of Chriss Tucker, who was unknown at the time, as well as Ice Cube's first taste at film sucess, after boys n tha hood. the standout performance has to go hands down to chris tucker, who carries the film along. this is a sleeper hit, and will be apreciated by all teenagers and adults arounf the world buy this film for youself and see, it is a must own in any dvd collection, and you wil not understand it until u see it. -Warren D'Mello, Australi 
This ISN'T Joseph. I am his oldest daughter. I love this movie and in my opinion, this is the best Friday movie EVER. The other ones were okay. Basically, this movie shows a typical friday in the "hood" for Craig (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker). In this movie, they have to deal with the neighborhood bully "Debo" who jacks people for their money and "ice". My favorite part of the movie is when drug dealer "Big Worm" sends people to do a "Drive By" in Craig's neighborhood because Smokey was too busy smoking up the weed instead of selling it (which he shouldn't do anyway)! It's hilarious because Smokey screams like a girl the whole time! As it's been said before, the sequels are missing "smokey" the lovable Chris Tucker who will have you sprawled out on the floor laughing! However, Mike Epps does a good job of keeping the jokes coming in the sequels. People, get this movie, it will have you saying, "Thank God it's Friday" 
Its pretty much a cliche to label an enjoyable movie a "classic". In my opinion, very few actually deserve to be called that, and this is one that does. For me, its the interplay between Chris Tucker and Ice Cube that makes it special. There are so many aspects of this movie that every person who's grown up in a Black neighborhood can relate to. Unconsciously, I substitute the characters in the movie to those I knew from around my block. Tucker, a natural comedian, is the undisputed star. Its strange for me to think that he was an unknown at the time the movie was made. I just got finished watching it again and laughed just about as hard as when it first came out in the theaters. This is the only one in the series that's worth watching, in my opinion. They should have done whatever it took to get Chris Tucker on each of the succeeding movies, and all of them would have been much better. 
Dated, derivative, self-indulgent unintelligent. This is truly bottom of the range stuff. The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire. None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully. I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour). Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase. 
Like most people, I saw this first on cable. About the same time, I saw Sean Penn's directorial debut, "The Indian Runner". I had a great respect for Independent films, like, forever, and "One False Move" is among the best. Carl Franklin is to be commended for putting the script (Billy Bob Tom Epperson) to film in a concise fashion. I don't agree with previous reviewers who thought it needed more ground. This is indeed an original. Bill Paxton, in his first lead role, is excellent, and hasn't been as good since (though I liked his smarmy performance in "True Lies") and the wonderful Cynda Williams won awards for her performance as Fantasia/Lila. The film score is legendary...indeed, Peter Haycock Derek Holt wrote a score that has been used in a whole bunch of cheesy films of the 90's; I don't really know if it was original for this one, but the use of the music by Terry Plumeri was effective and haunting. Billy Bob was a fine psychotic, and the most frightening performance of all came from Michael Beach as Pluto, never breaking a sweat as he slit a throat. Paxton really carries the film, along with Ms. Williams; you really want these people to survive. Life might be like that; a great exposition of good and evil, and delivered in fine fashion by the wonderful Carl Franklin. 
I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie. Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language! A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
I caught a glimpse of this movie years ago and I could not remember the name but I did know who stared in it...so when i went online to get the name of this I was pleased to see that the sender had it at a very good price...Thanks so much for having the movie and second getting it to me so quickly!!! Thanks again!! 
Billy Bob co-wrote and stars in this tightly woven, deeply textured, well-written off-beat thriller about a couple of drug dealers heading from CA to AK; combines the personal, the interpersonal, the deviant, with an unusual love story embedded craftily in the middle. This was on Roger Ebert's top ten list the year it came out. Although there are a couple of plot flaws, it works well enough to keep you anticipating the "showdown," because these seem to be authentic people trapped in a tragic destiny. This is a rare type of film nowadays: the kind that comes from the heart, not from the sterile factories of M.F.A. programs and lunkhead studios. 
i saw OFM when it first came out, over ten years back. it was on cable the other day. it still keeps me glued to the set. bill paxton, billy bob thornton, michael beach....great work. too bad this one didn't get more media and a larger audience 
before i even get into my glowing review of this cult classic horror film,i want to call a long overdue moratorium on the long winded, synopsis-heavy reviews, people read these to glean opinions and REVIEWS of the film from like minded genre fans, the brief, succinct synopsis that amazon provides is enough to allow the reader to decide if he wants to check out the film, the poorly written synopses are useless, time consuming, and they take up space. you didn't write the film, so chill out with the play by play, please. anyway, that having been said, this is pure, cheesy, schlocky 80's horror, all the elements are there: bad special effects that elicit instant laughs, a dorky horror freak best friend(who bears a resemblance to paul from the wonder years), a saucy older sister with even saucier friends, and a young, baby faced stephen dorff looking scared and perplexed for most of the film, a far cry from his cocky, arrogant, james dean/vampire turn as deacon frost in 1998's Blade. the final sequence, with the giant demon rising from the hole, is actually pretty impressive, at least for a film made in that era. worth buying. the dark poe 
I saw this movie. The things that sitck out for me is the Barbie doll to the eye and the dead workers in the wall. It has a cult-flick feeling to it. And for some reason I'll always love this flick 
After I saw this film, I went in my backyard and tried digging, then my mom yelled at me. Now I'm older and I am going to order this DVD. The movie is awesome, it's a classic in my mind 
I have yet to see this movie as an adult, but i remember being aroung the age of 8 and being allowed to watch this by an uncle of mind babysitting one night, and i about wet myself. Nightmares were a regular occurance after that night. I'm sure as an adult that ill wonder what i was thinking back then, but if you are looking for a movie with effects before its time, this is the one. Great film 
This film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times. It is not comparable to other great Westerns made during the sixties. Eli Wallach is good but confusing--who and what is he after? The color is good and it sounds like a Sergo Leone picure but it isn't. What a shame!!! It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!! Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't 
Cacopolus, played by Eli Wallach, is easily the best Western anti-hero to grace the silver screen. His dry wit, and useful sayings his "grandfather used to say" make him constant comic relief. Two friends rob a bank, and head out of town with their money, little do they know that their about to be duped by Cacopolus, an outlaw who know his way around money, and redefines the word "money laundering". After being robbed the duo seek out their mustached theif, following the trail of good deeds Cacopolus does throughout the country side, with their money 
Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film 
I like this film very much, but when are they going to put the three "Sabata" films on VHS or DVD? Lee Van Cleef made the first and third. Yul Brynner made the second Sabata and in some ways was the best. "Ace High" is a good film from the same mold of Leone's trilogy. Yet "Ace High," "Sabata," "Death Rides a Horse" and others look second rate though in the same genre. Terence Hill however does bring "Ace High" up one notch the more I think about it 
A part of this video was available through our cable company on demand. I got tired of watching the other programs my son always seemed to choose (over and over again) so I put this on hoping it'd be some good. My son loved it! He loved it so much I had to purchase it because he'd ask for it all day long and they'd taken it off cable. Someone had commented their daughter didn't like it and she was disappointed. This video is an educational video. It's not a tv show like Jay Jay the jet plane. It's a way for you to educate your child about whatever they enjoy, that's what the Big Adventure series is. If you've ever owned a video from Small-Fry you'd know that. It's a great alternative for people like me who'd prefer to educate their child instead of just letting them mindlessly watch cartoons over and over again. My son loves this video as well as the Big Train Trip. I'm going to try the construction video and the fire station video. I hope my son enjoys them as well as this one and the Big Plane Trip. 
My son was 3 when he first saw The Big Plane Trip, and since then we have purchased several more titles from the Big Adventure series. Each video is so well presented that adults enjoy watching them along with the children. They are well filmed and intelligently narrated. I especially like the way children ask and answer questions on the video. Currently my son is in love with The Big Airshow. We also have The Big Submarine, The Big Aircraft Carrier, The Big Zoo, and others. They are pretty much a guaranteed hit, and grown-ups as well as children come away with more knowledge 
Plenty of reviews have described this amazing movie. I'd just like to add a note on the meaning of the title. Most people have ignored it - one reviewer thought it was a reference to the frequency of shooting up. As an (ex) Brit, who grew up in Scotland, when I saw it, some time ago, I just automatically assumed something quite different. First - trainspotting is an actual hobby in Britain. Remember that this is a small country with a dense and active rail network. Lots of people are really, really interested in trains, but trainspotting is kind of the very lowest-grade interest. Trainspotters stand around stations, or major rail junctions, or marshalling yards, and just collect train facts - usually engine numbers, sometimes appearances of some particular kind of rolling stock. That is all they do - make lists! (Or sometimes trade number lists with other spotters, or exult in the size of their list). So the image of a trainspotter is a low-energy person, very conventional in outlook, probably standing for hours in the rain in a shabby raincoat...one who has pretty much given up on ever doing anything exciting and who absolutely needs to get a life! Collecting train numbers is basically pure, time-consuming obsession. Collecting stamps or beer mats or matchbooks, or any of the thousand other odd things people collect, sometimes has another dimension - artistic interest, investment, etc - train numbers lead nowhere. So to me the title "Trainspotting" was a sardonic reminder of the monotonous, meaningless "normal" life that the guys were rebelling against and trying to escape from - unwisely, but desperately - in their drug usage. It was the background against which the vivid and certainly scary picture was painted. Hope this was helpful. Would be interesting to hear from anyone associated with the movie if that's right - as I say, it was just the natural., automatic interpretation for me. PS - after reading many, many reviews - why is it that so many otherwise literate people just cannot spell the words definite and definitely? Many keep thinking there's an A in there somewhere...one even wrote "defiantly" which gave an interesting and unintended twist, and of course passed spell-check...Oh well 
This is one of the greatest films to come out of the UK in the past 20 years. That's saying quite a bit, considering the number of high calibre films the UK has come out with in the past 20 years. There are numerous great reviews here on amazon, therefore, I will be brief. I titled this as "Despair and Rebirth" What I mean by this is that the character Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) finally comes to terms with his self-destructive nature as a heroin addict; and awakens to a new and better tomorrow, and therefore gets a new lease on life: A much better life. Moreover, it is a new life that many of his friends never get in the film. And the way the film depicts his life as a junkie, along with his friends, is nothing but depair. You can't help feeling empathy for Mark Renton, and you root for him to succeed in overcoming his terrible addiction. This film is great because it does not gloss over the terrible and destructive nature of drug addiction: And heroin in particular. This film does not glorify drugs as one of the reviewers wrote, on the contrary, it gives the viewer the ugly truth about a life of addiction: Especially with the graphic scenes of how horrible the life of a junkie really is. With the opening scenes dialogue of Mark Renton sarcastically mocking society as not the life he chooses to live, to the end of the film's dialogue of his wanting to become part of society; the viewer can understand his reasons: Because in between these two dialogues, which serve as book-ends, the viewer witnesses the despair and horrible life that he lives. And the comfort is in seeing that he has decided to take an alternate course: A life without herion. The entire film is great and highly recommended. [Stars: 5+ 
Being Scottish, maybe I'm biased but this is a brilliant, laugh out loud funny , film. I looked at its reviews on the US Amazon site just to see what the Americans made of it - especially the accents. They're really not that "thick" as many reviewers state - I think even viewers from England understood them. Also, Trainspotting is intentionally funny; our sense of humour is not the same as yours though. Don't even think of reading the book if you found the accents unintelligible - its full of colloquial Scots (not Scotch - thats the drink).Theres also many even more gruesome scenes in the book than in the film. 
Ewan McGregor joins another fine ensemble cast. It's always been fashionable to say everything has been written/said/filmed/whatever before. As an author/reading junkie/movie buff, sometimes I start to believe it. Then a film like this comes along and kicks me squarely on my ample backside. Humor that's dark, witty, wicked, gritty, accurate. Based on a novel by someone with a true appreciation of, and a gift for, the language. No hesitation to smack you hard with the grim reality of heroin addiction. You're groaning. I can tell. You're thinking this is such a stale subject that it only proves my opening premise. But, you're wrong. Yet another keeper. Maybe I'll stay out of the DVD stores and let my lovely wife keep buying the films. I ignored this one for years because the cover's so ugly. I'm sure the novel was fantastic, and I know it must be damn hard to translate such novels to the screen because we've seen so many failures. But with a great screenwriter plus the right production team and actors, it can be done. It has been done. If you spot this, consider picking it up. But do read the reasons it's rated R. It's not for the kids. 
This movie is completely sick , a total gross out no holds barred film about heroin addiction, the way it should be. Heroin is not chic nor glamorous as is neither drug addiction, but the movie is sharp, fast and funny. The cast is great and the SOundtrack as well. Drugstore Cowboy with techno 
Its setting and subject matter were somewhat grim to put it mildly, but that didn't stop Trainspotting from becoming one of the top movies of the nineties, and having just watched it this morning I can safely state that it holds up well to this day. While I haven't read the Irvine Welsh novel on which this movie is based, I have read some of his other work, and the movie is a perfect distillation of his storytelling style-rapid-fire, filled with bawdy set pieces, characters living on the edge of acceptable society, and lots and lots of swears. It's also the kind of violent, genre-defying, and pop culture reference-laden movie, complete with way-cool soundtrack, that emerged with such force in the nineties and spawned so many imitations in this decade. For my money at least, this movie is a much more entertaining and convincing look at the world of heroin users than the interesting, but annoyingly depressing and pedantic, Requiem for a Dream, which came out a few years later to almost hyperbolic praise. Trainspotting is a blunt, unapologetic look a life most of us can scarcely imagine, delivered with a combination of hilarity and horror that effortlessly intertwines these two extremes. It doesn't shrink from depicting the damage caused by heroin addiction, but it doesn't downplay all the fun of it either, which is what lends it so much of its gritty believability. Trainspotting also marked the arrival on the international scene of director Danny Boyle, whose manic visual style would later serve him well on the slightly-less-brilliant 28 Days Later. Perhaps most impressively, it manages to contain one of my all-time top ten movie lines ("Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?"), my favorite nickname ever, fictional or otherwise ("We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit"-brilliant), and more "Oh my God, did I just see that?" images than you'll find in fifty Hollywood blockbusters. In Boyle's hands the crazy imagery practically flies off the screen, be it human waste flying from a sheet across a room, the movie's protagonist climbing into Scotland's filthiest toilet to retrieve something he lost, or the hallucinatory, nightmarish haze of a cold-turkey withdrawal. The unrestrained depictions of sex, nudity, violence, drug use, and bodily functions make this a movie not to be viewed by the squeamish, but they perfectly suit its unflinching examination of the sordid goings-on in one country's drug-laden urban culture. The action is filtered through the point of view of the movie's narrator, Mark Renton, a cynical but insightful twentysomething travelling through a nihilistic culture of nightclubs and drug dens without many concerns beyond getting his next fix because, well, all other concerns seem petty and inconsequential by comparison. Although I don't use drugs (well, the ones arbitrarily declared illegal anyway), it's not exactly hard to understand Renton's reasons-in a world as numbing as the one that surrounds him, the ephemeral rush of a heroin high is more tangible and true than most of what people use to distract themselves from their unfulfilling lives. Really, that's what the movie's about-the relentless pursuit of that elusive and nebulous concept known as happiness. Renton's not that bad a guy; he mostly just wants to score some drugs and sex and listen to some Iggy Pop, and if his lifestyle causes anyone else (i.e., his parents) to suffer, well, that's just an unfortunate byproduct. Besides, it's not like he's missing that much: the Scotland of Trainspotting is a rather depressing land of dingy, Detroit-esque post-industrial decay, and even the natural beauty of the local highlands isn't enough to overcome the cynicism that's overtaken Renton and most of his friends. Viewed against this backdrop, it's easy to ask whether the straight life is even worth it. Although Ewan MacGregor plays Renton in career-making fashion (too bad he spent all that time on those mediocre Star Wars prequels), Robert Carlyle delivers the most immediately enjoyable performance as the menacing Begbie, an unhinged, beer-swilling psychopath who looks at heroin users with contempt but has no problem cutting a swath of destruction through any bar where someone crosses him, intentionally or not. Even though (or perhaps because) he's so violent and unpredictable, Begbie gives the movie a sort of bizarre comic relief through the sheer force of his twisted personality alone. Even though I wouldn't get within fifty feet of the guy, I couldn't help but enjoy watching him, especially with Carlyle turning in such a likably maniacal performance. Besides, in addition to what I've written above, how can you not like a movie that features a shot of a dead baby crawling along a ceiling and rotating its head 180 degrees? If that doesn't scream fun for the whole family, I don't know what does 
The Danny Boyle directed "Trainspotting" was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of Scottish heroin addicted losers. While the film garnered accolades, I found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted. Ewan McGregor playing Mark Renton and his crew which included "Full Monty" star Robert Carlyle, as violent psycho Begbie, swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high. Congregating in a filthy, deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high. As a group they're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix. McGregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies. Remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories. In a humorous scene, cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in Scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories. He then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them. McGregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations, escaping to London and working as a realtor. His buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life. McGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true,........the big drug deal. They manage to complete the deal for 16,000 pounds which McGregor decides to steal. He intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew. Fat chance 
Like I said, simply outrageous in all the best ways. The thick accents did make it difficult to follow the dialogue at times, and I am pretty good at understanding accents. Mark's withdrawal scenes in his bedroom were incredible. Not just a heroin-is-bad story, but a true slice of life flick 
There are few movies which warrant a 5 star rating from me. If I could give Trainspotting 10 stars I would. For me, a movie has to stay with you long after the credits roll. It has to make you think and feel. It has to subject you to a roller coaster ride of emotions. Trainspotting delivers the goods. So many have described the movie and what it's about, I am not going to do that. Suffice it to say that the movie will make you cry, piss-your-pants laugh, think, cheer wildly and discuss it with your friends years after you first saw it. I remember having the nagging feeling that I needed to take a shower after seeing it. THAT, my friends, is the sign of a GREAT movie. Another great feature of Trainspotting is the soundtrack. It features many of my favorites, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, etc. The soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Everytime I hear Lust For Life by Iggy Pop now, I automatically think of Trainspotting. THAT is another sign of a great movie. If only it would get a Criterion release... 
I dont need to explain the plot of "Trainspotting", as pretty much ever other review has already done that. The film is half serious, half comical view of an extremely destructive, depressing lifestyle. I dont know if this won any awards, but it really should have because for the most part it doesnt follow any hollywood clich'es. Peac 
We have Right Brain and Left Brain. My triplets, who have very different personalities, liked Baby Einstein better when they were still in bouncers and crawling around. Now that they are toddlers at 22 mos, they've been enjoying Brainy Baby better. They still like Baby Einstein but since that only has music they just get the enjoyment of the pictures and music and such and the visual fun. With Brainy Baby, they are now learning because the narrator will say what's on the screen instead of just seeing it, so they are learning more now and understanding. For us, Baby Einstein is better for the infants, where Brainy Baby is better for the toddlers ages 1+ to start. But we love it! I didn't know they made more but now that I know I'm going to start buying the others! They love them 
I have 2 year old twins they enjoy this dvd, as well as learn from it. And when I put it on it holds there attention long enough to get in a half hour workout 
I purchased these used from a bookstore that buys and resells used books and videos. I think my baby boy was about 5 months old at the time. These were the ONLY videos that ever captured his attention at that young age. Any other video--Disney, Baby Einstein, etc.--just had him crying within a few minutes. These, though, he would watch to the end, fascinated. To this day, he loves them, and he is now 15 months old; the tapes are WORN OUT so I am reordering them both. Not only does he still love them, but I just had a new baby, and I am hoping they will entertain her just as much. In fact, the other night, we accidentally woke him up and he cried and cried and wouldn't go back to sleep. Finally, in desperation, my husband popped one of these into the VCR, and my son was INSTANTLY quieted the moment he heard the familiar music; in no time at all he was ready to go back to bed. We have since purchased most of the other titles in the Brainy Baby series--he loves them all, the music, the images of the babies, etc. The ABC video is especially well-done. He also gradually learned to enjoy other types of videos by Baby Einstein, Sesame Street, etc. But these two left right brain videos are still his very favorites. 
My son who is two just loves these videos. He interacts with them more than any other video 
Sorry, but I have to give this DVD a negative review. First of all: what age is it really for? There are many fragments that introduce spelling and addition. Don't you think it's a little bit yearly for your 6 months old (and probably even 3)? The DVD needs much more real life objects, it sounds and looks VERY dull and boring. I always thought that children learn through play, songs, rhymes, and etc, but not through dull repetition. Even alphabet is introduced without well known "ABC song". I am giving this DVD two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my 18 months old son (so far we saw it ones). As much more age appropriate material I would recommend: Hap Palmer "Baby songs: ABC,123, colors shapes"; Bee Smart Baby- Vocabulary Builder; Baby Babble - speech enhancing video; Baby Einstein- Van Gogh (world of colors); The Wiggles-"Toot-Toot" 
This is the review that almost wasn't. We bought this DVD months ago, and our daughter cried within moments of it coming on. She was very much a Baby Einstein kid. Recently, she actually asked for this DVD (luckily we hadn't given it away yet). She's 25 months and speech delayed. She usually sits quietly when a show is on. After watching this a couple of times, she was repeating sounds and actually tried to recite the alphabet. The repetitive nature of the DVD series seems to be the key, here. We've since acquired Right Brain, English and ABCs, all of which she loves and responds to. I can't wait to get more 
Before I purchased this DVD - I rented it from the library along with Baby Einstein language DVD. My daughter loves the Baby Brainy and will watch the whole thing - the Einstein she only watched for about 5 minutes and turned away. 
Two thumbs way up for this addition to the RIGHT BRAIN video! Our daughter is either busy trying to find the flash card that goes with what is being shown on the screen or she is twirling to the music. Either way she is learning and that is the whole reason we bought these in the first place. I have found quality for my money and an educational experience with Brainy Baby that doesn't talk down to our kids but inspires them to join in on the learning 
I have a 13 month old boy and he has both the Right and the Left Brain video and he loves them! I can have the TV on any time around him but he only really pays attention to it when I put on one of these videos. I tried the Baby Einstein videos and Baby Mozart held his interest for a bit, but nothing like the Brainy Baby series. I've noticed that at first he loved the Right Brain the most but as he gets older he is becoming more and more interested in the Left Brain Video. I have also lent them to my friends that have the Einstein videos and some of them have gone out to buy the Brainy Baby series. I'm on my way now to try some more of the serie 
I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD since I first saw it back in July. I still can't understand why the critics just didn't get this one. This has to be one of the best second films ever made in a Trilogy. The addition of Davy Jones was brilliant. It made the film much darker and more dramatic. Johnny Deep was superb as usual. I still can't believe that the film made $400 million dollars domestically and over $1 billion dollars worldwide. It's surreal. But everything about this movie was so on point that it's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film. I enjoyed this one more than the original. I thought the story was more interesting on this occasion. Although, you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of Geoffrey Rush's character. He and Depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him. It was a huge void to fill. But enter Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and all is well. I guess that's one reason why "Dead Man's Chest" woks the way it does. Billy Nighy gives an A-list performance. And when you add in Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, it's money in the bank. The only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original "Star Wars." Yes, I prefer "Pirates" over TLOTR. Although, perhaps my comments are premature since "At World End" hasn't even been released yet. Should that be a dud, then of course the whole thing falls apart. But here's hoping that the third time is a charmer. If you own the first "Pirates" on DVD then you have to get this. Don't miss out. 
I LOVED the first movie...and I'm sad I can't say the same here. As Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald put it: The worst kind of sequel - the kind that exists only to give you more, more, MORE of what you particularly liked about the first film, without ever justifying its own existence. Indeed, in my view, Dead Man's Chest was just that, and it didn't please me nearly as much as the first. What the filmmakers did was listen closely to what audiences said about Curse of the Black Pearl. The audience liked the swashbuckling action, the audience like the humor, and of course, the audience L-O-V-E-D Capt. Jack Sparrow. The filmmakers took this feedback and tried to incorporate these things into Dead Man's Chest. Oh boy did they try - way too hard. It shows. Swashbuckling action? Let's give them a three-way sword fight between the three main characters that lasts twice as long as it should. Swashbuckling action: check. Humor? Let's bring back Pintel and Regetti, the comic relief of the first movie, and make them a bigger part. We don't have to explain how they got out of jail and why others of Barbossa's crew didn't. We don't have to explain why they both vow to help bring Jack Sparrow back when, in the first movie, they helped maroon him and almost shot him. They're funny, that's what the audience wants. And hey, lets have most of the cast on an island inhabited by cannibals. We can have Jack roasting on a spit, then have it become a shishkabob later. We can have the crew in hanging cages, swinging back and forth and rolling downhill in them. This whole scene of the movie will be utterly pointless, but it give them the laughs they want. Humor: check. Jack Sparrow? We'll have plenty of him, but just doing these silly loony toon-like stunts. Not putting him in different critical situations that display his cunning and convincing negotiation skills and his quick-thinking. And what of the central threatening situation? Whether it was escaping from a sinking dory or fighting a ferocious battle with his former first mate or facing death by hanging, Jack was always calm, cool, and collected. Not this time. So what if it goes against him (as one filmmaker said himself) always believing that if he can just hang on long enough, that everything will eventually turn in his favor. Make him visibly afraid. Make him panic at the sight of a black spot on his hand. Make him cringe at the first sight of Davy Jones. Yes, Jack Sparrow's mannerism will be a bit different this time, but its Johnny Depp in the same pirate costume - it should satisfy the audience. Jack Sparrow: check. But what of the other things that make a film good? Things like, say, a story? Aware that the film did need a tale to tell, the filmmakers decided the "plot" of Dead Man's Chest would be four individual dilemmas thrown clumsily together: Cutler Beckett wants Jack Sparrow's compass (why? we'll have to wait for the 3rd movie to find out), Norrington seeks to restore his now-shattered career to it's previous glory, Will and Elizabeth must get Beckett what he wants in order to escape the hangman's noose, and Jack Sparrow attempts to weasel out of a 13-year-old bargain made with Davy Jones. What does this all come down to? Only one character accomplishes what he/she set out to do in the whole 2.5 hours. Norrington brought Davy Jones' heart to Beckett - but Will had to steal the key from Jones first. That's the only thing that actually gets DONE in the movie. How could that have taken 2.5 hours to do? It didn't. Then what filled up the extra time? The pointless stuff I mentioned above. As Ty Burr of the Boston Globe put it: It goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2.5 hours to get there. I'm not someone whom filmmakers can show three men sword-fighting and a group of savage cannibals chasing someone down a beach and expect me to be impressed. There needs to be a point, something to it all. As Dana Steven of Slate put it: Without a beating heart at its center, this chest feels empty indeed. One star for effort...and for Davy Jones' creative design (tentacles for a beard, nice) 
As a teenager I have to say that this movie was incredible..it was awesome, yet still clean..I def. can't wait for it to come out on DVD 
If you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for "A Beautiful Mind" or even "Lord of the Rings" you've missed the boat. This movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what's so great about it. See this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh, to gross you out, to surprise you with its clever twists of plot, to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds, and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates' treasures. 
I loved this movie. I didn't think the plot was patchy at all, and I didn't think it was hurried either. What i do think is that people forget that the movie company had the third movie already in the makes when the second was in theaters. I was taken away with the plot. It was so deep and there were so many threads of different plot-lines and different ties that would explain something later that i was breathless. Like for one, what is with his hat? does it too have magical powers? his compass! i loved how that took a whole knew leap! heck, i want to know if the little dangly coin in his hair by his face has a significance. Everything about Jack Sparrow has a reason -like him carrying the gun with one shot. you didn't find out why he kept it till the very end -he kept it to pay back Barbossa. Anyway; people should not view this second movie as a stand-alone. No, view it as you did the Lord of the Rings -it'll take more than one movie to get the entire plot told. What i think is that, the script was so long but so good, that the company decided not to cut. They didn't want to cut out all the originality of the story -so they decided to just cut the script in half and have it told in two movies. I believe all those 'plot holes' people complain about in this second movie will be answered in movie three. That's what i think anyway. I loved it though. I do agree that the love triangle with Will, Elizabeth, and Jack was weird -it even had me tilting my head in confusion; but again, there's probably a reason for that -maybe the hat! hah! maybe the hat keeps the women away ;) who knows! we'll find out in May, aye? but like i said, don't view this movie as a stand-alone, see it as the first half of a continuation that it is. I loved it and i'm anxious for the third movie to come out. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good long movies/stories that have hidden meanings in words and actions, and twists in a plot that will shock you and yet excite you at the unexpectedness of it. i think everyone's questions will be answered in movie three -that's the whole point to having a 'to be continued' at the end of the movie, right? it means there is more to come and there is more that needs to be explained. so enjoy this movie and enjoy that feeling of excitement and dissapointment that you have to wait for the third to come out in order to see the conclusion to this plot. I loved it -But i'm a writer, maybe i'm used to seeing things like this because i do it myself. Why cut off a story at a point where a reader will be satisfied? Nooooo, you cut it off at a cliff hanger so that they will come looking for answers and to see if the characters will succeed. It's an old trick used since the beginning of time. it builds tension and i think ontop of people forgetting it's a two-part story, they didn't want to be left hanging and forced to wait. Face it, we aren't a patient society and we want everything now. But our patience will be rewarded in movie three. so enjoy movie one with it's completeness, and enjoy movie two as the beginning of the Grand Adventure. Because it's just the beginning; everything will be answered soon, and the plot will only thicken -at least in my opinion. ~Me 
My expectations were high for this film. They were met, but just barley. With another Jack Sparrow produced adventure, this film suffers the weight of a confusing script, a bad performance from Orlando Bloom, and the sheer amount of volume they attempted to "cram" into this picture. The visuals in this film are fantastic, the music is pulse-pounding, and the sound is rich in detail. The script, however, seems to be attempting too many plot lines to keep a precise view on the major storyline. I'm sure they needed to get some necessary material out of the way and developed in time for the third film but it seems to me to be too much! (Plot Spoilers) The characters also suffer in this film. Jack Sparrow and Barbossa are the only well-developed and well performed characters. Will and Elizabeth seem more like composted clichï¿½, studio produced nonsense. This film is no exception. Bloom did not live up to my expectations on character development by any means. For example, when Will finds out his father is alive, it is as if it does not surprise him all that much. After seeing him successfully command a siege and engage in a love affair with a king's wife in Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut, I expected so much more from him. Knightly, on the other hand, seems to fair a little better with the material. Her performance in this film was much more dynamic. I especially love Johnny Depp's conversations with her. She seems to be getting a handle on her character. By the time we get to the end of the film, I feel like I've been at la Fitness all day. I feel pumped but I also want to sleep asap. Overall, this is an average film heightened only by its technical achievements and a few good performances. Recommended but proceed with caution, the third film might get a little shaky since it bears the weight of the first two and the high expectations of a good original plot payoff. 
What a disappointment! I absolutely loved The Black Pearl but was admittedly nervous about a sequel. As it turned out, I had every reason to be. It whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original, major or minor, who seemed interesting. That they did but, unfortunately, the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say. Depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while Keira must have, somehow, pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie. Legolas, I mean, Orlando Bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along, sometimes good but more often, haphazardly. To my mind, the only real interesting addition was that of Davey Jones. Except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying (due to the tentacles 'n all), at least his was a unique addition to the movie. I do sort of object, however, to associating him with the Flying Dutchman legend. The two have nothing to do with each other, fantasy or not. And don't get me started on the cannibals! Any way, I think this movie merits the two y'ars I gave it. While considerably beneath that first movie, it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times, but it is most definitely not as good. And, as a final thought, the very last scene of the movie? Lose it entirely. It simply was unnecessary. 
I didn't notice it was a bad movie. All I saw was Johnny Depp. Seriously, it's a great movie. I think maybe people are forgeting this started out as a childrens' movie. 
Among Soviet movies there are more expensive (Bondarchuk's War and Peace) and more intellectual (Sokurov, Tarkovsky), but The White Sun of the Desert remains the best known and the most popular Russian film ever made. If you ask people (especially men) who were born and raised in the former Soviet Union, you will be convinced by their enthusiastic response and expression of love for this movie. It is rare indeed for a work of art to elicit such a uniform and unconditional admiration, and there must be something about this film which deserves such a reaction from several hundred million people. There is a lot of myths and legends surrounding the creation of this film. One legend (which is probably true) has it that, after the movie was made, it was censored and "put on the shelf" never to be seen again. Then, one dark and stormy night, there was a call to the State Film Archives from Brezhnev's dacha (suburban mansion). They were asking for something new for the "big boss" to watch. The clerk on duty, scared out of his wits, picked up a reel-box and sent it with the awaiting car. Brezhnev (who was not senile yet) liked the movie and asked why it has not been released. The rest is history. The timeless appeal of this movie, as any other true work of art, is that you can watch it time after time, never tire of it, and find something new and interesting about it. Every kind of viewer will find something to like about this film: excellent direction, good actor's work, well-developed characters, unusual plot line, and a lot of action. And the best of all: it is based on the true events. The original intent of the movie was to shoot another action flick about the Red Army fighting anti-soviet bands in the Middle Asia after the Civil War. Another legend has it that when one of the old Red Army soldiers who participated in actual fighting was asked by the script-writer and director about the difficulties of the time, he thought about it for a while and then said that the most difficult question was what to do with all those women coming from harems of bandits who were either killed or in hiding. That created the wonderful story line of the movie. The quality of image transfer on this DVD is very good. If you watch many foreign language movies, you probably know that the best way is to read the subtitles, not listen to the dubbed version, which is not good anyway. If you are interested in cinematography, you cannot do without watching this film. If you just would like to watch an interesting movie - get it, you won't regret 
I'd give 4 stars for this DVD release. The movie itself has a special place for anyone who grew up watching soviet movies. To relate the atmosphere of an old 60's soviet "eastern" is not easy to an american viewer, and I believe a better english dubbing could do this movie a better justice. Besides that, it's a must have, particularly for any russian ex-pat 
Comming of age in the 80's is getting made fun of lately, but I thought it was a good time to grow up with the exception of the advent of AIDS. People were dieing so fast and I lost teachers to that. It was not like today. This movie is really good and in the 1980's style. It is a great comedy. If you like the 80's and want to understand some of the refrences in the media where they keep saying Bueller repeated times see this movie. You will also get to see where the guy who does the clear eyes comercials go his start in this movie. Anyway perhaps you just might like the 80's if you do not already if you watch some of these good comming of age movies and listen to our music 
Bueller, Ferris Bueller OK, lets start off with what wrong with this edition of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. there are two problem I see with this new Bueller Bueller DVD edition of Ferris...One is the over use of actor/know it all Ben Stein and the missing director John Hughes's missing audio commentary. Now the good news. There are extras like a few great documentries with most of the cast talking about this movie. And then there is the movie itself-The extras are fine. However the film is a minor classic. Matthew Broderick emits an air of whimsey with a wink of his eye. Broderick's odyseey of adventure isnt lost on his audience. He is part Robert Preston from the Music Man/Part W.C. Fields/Part Robert Wagner from It Takes a Thief. Broderick playing Ferris is slick, sly and a con man with style. He pokes a stick of his collective eye of Principal Jeffrey (Deadwood) Jones and we are laughing at his antics with enjoyment. The supportive cast of Alan (Spin City) Ruck and Mia Sara makes a sorta lover's triangle without love nor passion..more deeper friendship. The two combined with Broderick makes this film a buddy movie, rather than a TEEN angst film (like Not another Teen Movies or Ten Things I hate about you) So want to laugh and enjoy the system being poked, get this film and as Ferris would say, "What are you Still doing here? Why aren't you buying this yet?" Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL 
Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another "sick" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: "Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it." That's the moral of the story, really. "Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?" Not here, but he'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life, and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day 
Perfect movie for everyone. No matter how many times I watch the movie it is always funny. Whether you are stll in school or schools days are behind you this movie will make you feel good. 
Matthew Broderick stars in this very funny film about a high school student who decides to take a day off of school. What happens next can only be described as remarkable and somewhat crazy. Broderick stars as Ferris Bueller, a somewhat clever and deceitful (in a funny way) high school senior who, along with his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) decide to skip school and visit the sights and sounds of downtown Chicago in springtime. Ferris convinces Cameron to take his father's prized red Ferrari out for the day. Reluctantly, Cameron agrees, and soon the two are off on their adventure. Their next plan is to get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school so she can go along. Ferris and Cameron devise a plan to call the school and tell Dean of Students Ed Rooney (Jeffery Jones) that Sloane's grandmother passed away. Dressed in a long trenchcoat and hat, Ferris arrives at the school to pick up Sloane, and the three drive happily away. However, Mr. Rooney suspects that something is up and immediately suspects that Ferris is at the root of it. He sets off to find Ferris himself and bring him back to school. By the end of the movie, Mr. Rooney probably wishes he had stayed in his office. Meanwhile, Ferris' sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) has figured out what Ferris is really doing. Angry that Ferris seems to get away with everything, she has to deal with the entire school taking up a collection for poor, sick Ferris while she really knows what is going on. In the end, though, she proves to be a big help to him. After heading downtown, the trio take the Ferrari to a local parking garage. Cameron's father knows the exact mileage of the car, so Cameron is already nervous about allowing Ferris to drive it. But that's just the beginning. The garage attendant decides to take the car out for a joyride and racks up over 180 more miles on the odometer. During their day,Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane manage to see the Sears Tower, a Cubs game, visit the Art Institute, and see Ferris sing "Twist and Shout" from a parade float. But when they head back to the garage to get the car, Ferris finds out about the extra mileage, and Cameron goes crazy. Ferris seems to think that by driving backwards that the miles will come off, so they jack the car up in the garage and put it in reverse. However, the miles don't come off. Cameron, having suffered through a tumultuous relationship with both of his parents, takes out his aggression on the car. Soon, it goes careening out of the back of the garage and lands in a pile of trees. Cameron actually feels relieved because now his father will actually have to talk to him. But Ferris realizes that he has only 5 minutes to get home before his parents do. Will he make it in time? This movie has attained a sort of "cult" status over the years and still remains as funny as ever. Matthew Broderick is perfect as the scheming Ferris, while Jeffery Jones does a very good job as Mr. Rooney. Jennifer Grey plays the part of the overlooked and jealous sister perfectly, and Alan Ruck's job as the reluctant and somewhat confused Cameron is the perfect companion to the wild and reckless Ferris. Let's not forget the funny cameo by Ben Stein as the teacher who coined the term "anyone, anyone, Bueller?" I recommend this extremely funny movie very highly. The acting is great and the story is very funny. As a Cubs fan, I was glad to see the scenes in Wrigley Field and hear Harry Caray's voice. Watch this great movie and see how much trouble and mischief three friends can get into in one day 
One of John Hughes best films,Ferris Bueler made me laugh harder than any other Hughes film. The though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were him.I love this film 
I could watch this over and over again! It's so funny! The person who dissed women's manly handshakes is a sexist! But anyway, I would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch! Definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too.....for one viewing per 5 months. Don't force it on them is my advice!! Rock o 
This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller. This is a classic that every high school student should see. It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best. It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star 
A movie with one good line after another, funny and interesting characters and lttle vignettes of hilareous bit part players. Just a great funny movi 
Haven,t seen this movie for years,but it,s still the cult classic I remember, with great performances from all. Still one of my all time favourite films 
This film hit a nerve with anyone in highschool during the mid-to-late 80's, and the commentary on popularity still holds true today. The number of cliques in my school was staggering, and I meandered from group to group, never dropping anchor. I stayed sane, while watching everyone else fall apart. LOL. I knew quite a few "Heathers". All the same basically; school being not so much academic as social. Most of the adult figures in the film are mindless twits, oblivious to the needs of youth. This is still one of my top ten favorite movies 
I remember watching this movie a few years back. I thought it was decent overall. But my biggest question is if Jason hated the world so much, why didn't he blow himself up inside the gym 
"I just killed my best friend." "And Your Worst Enemy" Excellent Dark Comedy.. I love this movie religiously 
The 80s totally rocked, with laid back teenagers who were a little wild, a little care free. Who doesn't love that? Especially when it's in a movie like "Heathers". This black comedy is totally wild, in a very great way. It's unlike any other movie I've seen, everything about it is very special. The language, the situations, the attitudes and actions of the cool but bizarre characters. Veronica (Ryder) is a really great girl, but she is "best friends" with the Heathers. The 3 most popular girls in school, all named Heather. Veronica hates her friends, they are complete snobs. She even wishes Heather #1 would DIE. Veronica meets the wild and crazy JD, and she falls for him. With two extraordinary characters like these, there's bound to be trouble. One accidental (well, sort of accidental) death leads to a series of other deaths, all poking fun at the serious issue, teen suicide. Fall in love with the crazy Veronica and JD as Veronica tries to stop their crazy ways. Laugh your butt off at the lines used in this cutting edge film. Believe me, you have NEVER heard or seen anything like it. You may even pick up a couple of crazy lines you hear in this movie, I know I sure do. Have fun watching these crazy and bizarre scenes that will make you laugh and say "Wow" at the same time. "Heathers" is a movie that is ahead of it's time, teenagers can relate to the characters, it pokes fun at serious issues.. but it is 100% hilarious. Loosen up and watch "Heathers". 
Black comedy at it's best. This film is so brilliant in the way it doesn't sit there and glorify suicide, it just makes fun of what all other movies were doing and the way the media was making it the top story really no matter what. I like that idea. Sometimes I write a review just to make fun of somebody elses. You haev to have that type a sense of humor to really like this film. When Christian Slater shows up for his first scene of the movie doing his jack nicholson impression voth in vioce and in character and pulls out a gun to shoot the second and third person that he conversates with was a pretty surreal moment. Of course we find out that the gun was empty and your heart may slow down a tad. So we continue and find out who these Heathers are. You will figure it out pretty quick, it is just like any other teen movie but manages to give that extra sense of style for the time. And the director does a great job of showing the girls seeming 30 years old when they are really like 16, but then acting their age around any older person that they have to interact with like college students. Don't expect anything real, but more what of these types of people would have been like back in high school if they could achieve that kind of power. Or sadly enough, what probably happened in many schools. But the acting, direction and overall cheesy type of fun just ends up xploding into a great movie. The music will certainly help you through a lot of weird scenes. Picture quality is aesome. The commentary is really good with explaing literally everything that happens. All that you want to know will be answered for sure. The documentary does a wonderful job of explaining how the movie was put together, making of, and a great job explaining what exactly it is about. Also you realize all the greatly talented people who worked with other major direcors/producers amd things all on their own. Also the cast gives you more than your fill of info. And if you can make it through the 100 paegs of notes to read the real ending, it is very trippy and gives you some insight of how they original wrote it. Not just a black comedy but one of the most twisted films ever. But funny. The writer is certainly, what is the word, well , I will go with prolific, he can write for probaably 48 hours straight or so I would imagine. So easily a 5/5 for the dvd realease. And a great movie. 
a film about teens plagued with mean spiritedness and revenge on their minds ends up being one of the best films of the 80's. one of the most darkest comedies with envious contempt. evil at its core, yet deliciously irrisistable. the whole cast is sensational, especially ryder, who still says in interviews today, this is personally her favorite film she has done in her career 
Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done, my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun. The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha. For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making. 
I know I did. Sometimes the pressure of stupid jocks and stupid plastics cant drive you up the wall! This movie is a great representation about the adventures of High School and trying to fit in. It sends a great message to just forget the crowd and do your own thing 
Hi, I just wanted to say that for those saying that the "Complete" series are composed of 26 episodes, they're wrong, the FULL series are 30 Episodes. With a not that bad ending 
Awesome Anime...you would be hard pressed to find one that's better. This one was actually suggested to me by a friend and after I watched the first 3 episodes I was hooked. I have watched the entire series now. The story is very well developed and mainly follows 4 wolves on their journey to find paradise which is supposed to be opened by the wolves with the help of the flower maiden. Kiba, Tsume, Hige, and Toboe are the four travelers and for the most part take a human form to fool the humans because wolves are supposed to be extinct. Each character has his or her own distinct personality. Toboe is the youngest of the group and tends to be more scared and child like but he is also driven to prove himself, he grows so much over the course of the show, Tsume is dangerous and wild and even though he pretends to be cold he really likes being part of his new pack, Hige is pretty go with the flow for most of the series, and Kiba is very determined verging on one track minded and seems to sense things the others can't. If you're not into crying I wouldn't suggest this anime because trust me you will be crying by the end, I think I spent the last 4 or 5 episodes sobbing. But it's a great story and these are great characters. If you buy this anime you won't be disappointed. I loved it from beginning to end! 
There is a subgenre of anime, very possibly inspired by the horrors of Japan's nuclear bombing, that deals with the end and rebirth of the world. Wolf's Rain joins Neon Genesis Evangelion and Rahxephon in the trilogy of the subgenre's best known works, and is by far the most accessible of the three. In the vague future, or perhaps an alternate universe, wolves have mastered the ability to create illusions allowing them to survive among humankind, and a legend tells that when wolves join a flower maiden, paradise will be opened and the apocalypse will begin. As scientists create a flower maiden named Cheza, four solitary wolves join to form a pack. Kiba, the soul of the pack, has a sixth sense driving him towards Cheza and attuning him to her. Tsume, the mind of the pack, is calm and rational, offering a needed counterbalance to Kiba's dreaming. Hige, the body of the pack, is canny and streetsmart, the best at navigating the practicalities necessary to survive. Toboe, the heart of the pack, is kindness, compassion and innocence personified - and the pack's link to humanity, as he had until recently been domesticated. Also entangled in their story are Quent, a wolf hunter driven by grief who wrongly blames them for the murder of his wife and son and won't rest until they're dead; Cher, a scientist and Cheza expert; and Cher's ex Hubb, a good man and wonderful husband whose marriage to her was unfortunately a casualty of her obsession with Cheza. As the wolves join with Cheza and seek paradise, they must deal with the human population terrified of them, the military tracking Cheza down, Quent's single-minded determination, the forces of nature, even darker enemies they are not yet aware of - and perhaps most of all their own hopes and fears about Paradise and what it will mean if and when they reach it. This is a beautiful, epic story with some of anime's most gorgeous artwork and characters you will very quickly come to love. The whole series and soundtrack are included, and I'll note here that the fourth dvd can safely be skipped, as it consists of a series of flashback episodes necessitated by a halt in production during the SARS epidemic. I'll also note that this one is not for kids, as it becomes quite violent and very dark. If you want a deep, mature anime with an ending that will stay etched in your mind, this is for you.  
To begin with, the story evolves in a future time or something like a "parallel" dimension which has a lot in common with earth. It evolves around four friends - Kiba, Hige, Tsume and Tolboy - who are actually wolfs but are able to transform into humans and a young girl, Cheza, which is basically the so called lunar flower. As for the story, for an anime, it is honestly complicated and therefore, I will try to describe it as simple as possible without giving so much away. The world is in a very bad shape, war brakes out and in the middle are these five friends who try to find their way to paradise and with the help of Cheza to unlock it. To all this comes a guy named Quent who tries to kill every wolf alive, and the reason is that wolfs are supposed to have killed his family (something that proofs later on to be a crime that has been "accomplished" by someone else). Quent has also, for his hunt, a half female wolf. To make things more complicated there is a female scientist Cher, who is so fascinated with the entire wolf/paradise situation that would do everything to follow their steps. What basically turned her into a "fanatic" about all this is that she holds a book named "The Book of the Moon" which basically explains, more or less, what is going on. Her ex-husband detective Hubb Labowski, will risk everything in order to make her love him again and win her back. To all this comes a noble man Darcia, who is actually a wolf as well, but his wife got a disease and the only way to help her is through Cheza. Well, if I am not mistaken, these are the main protagonists. As for the story, the protagonists have to go through various difficulties during a period of war. Furthermore, "earth" is falling apart and they are running out of time. Moreover, as another reviewer has already stated it, is that the series are very emotional, especially towards the end where, lets say, people who you started to like will die. The character development is very good and romantic-love relations will evolve (but have nothing to do with nudity). In the end all pieces come together with the exception of the last minute which gives you a finish in the idea of Evangelion. The animation, with a few exceptions, is very good and the music superb. To sum up, the shows are seriously very good. Therefore, if you can afford the money, you should definitely buy it and surely will not be disappointed. 
This is my absolute favorite anime series I have ever seen. This is the series that got me interested in anime and started my slight "obsession". I own all the singles of the dvds and still plan to buy this set. The sereies it's self is so well done. It's very well planned with the main story and then two or three side stories that are still wonderful to see. This is not a light hearted story, it has a dark shadow over it most of the time, but it just hightens the intensity. The story circles around four wolves, Hige, Toboe, Tsume, and the kinda "leader" of them, the one that starts the hunt for paradise, Kiba. They are all looking for a way to the fabled paradise and to open it for the wolves, while a noble named Darcia wants to open it for the nobles. They are all frantically trying to get their hands on the flower maiden named Cheza who is the key to opening paradise. The story follows them as they cross the dying earth to open the doors to a better tomorrow. They have very strong unique personalities that make you fall in love with each of them by the end. There are several other characters that pop up often, and they have their own troubles and stories, and help break some of the tension of the story along the way as well. The voices for all the characters are wonderful (including the voice of Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop as Darcia) and only bring the stories more to life. The graphics are very like Cowboy Bebop and the slight fade to the colors really works for the story. And who can ever complain about music done by the great Yoko Kanno. I wanted to cry when I heard the end song the first time because they're just so moving. I have both the soundtracks and I love every one of the tracks. This has definetely become one of the classics and I would HIGHLY recommend this series to everyone 
I'll start this by saying that Wolf's Rain is one of those anime that people are going to talk about for a long time, kind of like Trigun and Cowboy Bebop. The story is as magical as any I've seen, the characters, though stereotypical at first, turn into some truly lovable specimens, and the setting and the atmosphere is convincing, if a bit over-done (post-apocalyptic). After that, the music accompanies this series excellently, the animation quality is so startlingly good that it's hard to believe that this is a thirty episode series (the budget must have been huge), and the voice-acting, both English and Japanese, is superb. Since this is the review for the box set, I won't say much on the story, other than that it is filled with some imagination and very few stereotypes. It follows a group of wolves, all unique in character, as well as some of their human compatriots and enemies, as they search for Paradise, which can only be found by wolves. Along the way, they battle nobles, a revenge-hungry hunter, and face some tragic losses (and they even face four episodes of repetition in "flash-back" episodes, but this had something to do with the SARS scare in Asia, which made it impossible for the animators of Wolf's Rain to do any real work other than recap episodes). Now, I'd like to talk about the box. It seems American anime studios are beginning to understand that the fans love their soundtracks. Box sets and art boxes are coming with soundtracks more and more often, and Wolf's Rain is no different, other than the fact that the music is Wolf's Rain was excellent. This set also includes all seven of the DVDs, with all the original artwork and features, packed into this awkwardly shaped, though still beautiful, set. A little pricey, maybe, and certainly not cutting edge since Irresponsible Captain Tylor has a mega-set out much like this, Wolf's Rain is one of those anime that is worth the high price, especially when you consider the content and the actual worth. So, if you were a fan of Wolf's Rain when it ran on TV, then now is a the best time to get this set, before it is gone. 
Being a long time lover of Wolves, Bandai's "WOLF'S RAIN" seemed like an ideal way to go to watch wolves since you could never really get close to them in real life. However, I had been weary of the series ever since its debut on Adult Swim - having serious doubts about the integrity of that television block on Cartoon Network (despite the fact that THE BIG-O and BIG-O II were featured in its block). I even kept my sister from watching due to most of the content in the series and ADULT SWIM itself. Somewhere in the summer of 2005, I decided to take a chance and watch this series little by little with rental DVDs. As of December 24th 2005 - I've completed watching the series: It is now one of the few favorite Japanese cartoons I watch and enjoy. STORY: The storyline for Wolf's Rain is not so much as complex as it is unexplained throughout the overall series: The story takes place in an almost always used post-apocalyptic time when much of the world has been ecologically devastated and most people live in poverty. A legend is told in the Book of the Moon that wolves are mystical beings who came to the world from a place called Paradise, at the dawn of time. It is also said that, in the future, wolves will, with the help of a mysterious woman called the "Flower Maiden" (a being created from the essence of lunar flowers), find a way to return to paradise and in doing so, bring about the end of the world. This legend is difficult for most to believe though, because wolves were thought to have been hunted to extinction nearly 200 years ago. However, the truth is that the wolves have just become very adept at hiding themselves in human society, with the ability to appear human, including the abilities of speech and manual dexterity, while still retaining their lupine senses, agility, and natural weapons. This seems to put the show in the realm of werewolf fantasy, but the wolves' human form is portrayed as more of a mental effect than shape-shifting. A young White Wolf named Kiba searches for the now "mythically regarded" world that is Paradise: He finds his way into a run down city, badly wounded. It is there he meets another wolf in disguise - Tsume, a ringleader of a human gang. Elsewhere a Hunter and his Dog Blue travels into a town one day, searching for wolves due to a tragedy that happened earlier in his life concerning wolves. Since no one believes in wolves, many take Quent Yaiden for a binge drinking crazy wielding a shotgun, never to be taken seriously. Upon traveling through the city he encounters a large White Wolf (Kiba) limping through the city. From there the storyline takes off with several other characters: Hige and Toboe who accompany Kiba, along with Tsume. All four wolves escape the city to find Paradise, and perhaps the Flower Maiden that will lead them there. Many things in Wolf's Rain is left unexplained or never properly explained. A prime problem that seems to plague the fictional history of what happened to the world and the background history on the Wolf characters and Human's alike. Most say the series ended quite abruptly leaving most things undone and out in the open. While I agree with most of the things mentioned in the comment, I actually liked the way the series ended. It gave no feeling that there was going to be a a SEQUEL whatsoever. It was a nice ending in my opinion. 4/5 ANIMATION: The animation for the show is top notch for a series created in 2003: The running animations for the wolves is simply amazing and realistic given the technology used nowadays. Wolf's behavior was strongly studied in development. The four legged canines act and sound more like their real life counterparts as opposed to how they've usually been portrayed in cartoons in any country. Regular human movement was also studied a lot more in this cartoon but still retain the cartoonish movements as expected. The sparsely used Computer Generated images were thankfully, bearable, in this cartoon unike most Anime series which have adopted the CGI ways and animated in everything from machines, buildings to Environments. 4/5 CHARACTERS: The Five main characters, Kiba, Hige, Tsume, Toboe, and Blue all have uniquely developed personalities while retaining the stereotyped "Follows his instincts and never gives up" - "Happy-go-lucky" - "innocent and optimistic" - "Tough guy, soft heart" - and "Outcast/half-breed" - which is never indulged. The wolf guises were basically an another drawer to the show for me. While the human forms were for ease of watching the show so it didn't end up feeling like a "talking animal" show, I found myself wondering why the human guises got more screen time than the Wolf's guises did. Other characters like The Hunter, Cher, Hubb, and Cheza, are nice fillers for diversity in different points of the storyline, which does slightly focus on Cheza later on. The villains are the usual philosophized, prophesied searching for Paradise as well. 5/5 ENVIRONMENTS: The wilderness backgrounds are probably the best part of the environments in this series. From the forests, Iceland's, and deserts, the landscape is excellently painted and look very natural as opposed to their futuristic cities that look the part of almost every futuristic city in Anime cartoons. In other words the earthly backgrounds are the better. 3/5 MUSIC: I never really listen to reviews or read anything on overrated COMPOSERS of any kind, the two most overrated composers being John Williams and Yoko Kanno who did the score for Wolf's Rain (among others). The music is not half bad, the almost foreign sound to the instruments and the way most of the music is utilized plays nicely within the series itself. The score overall could've been done far better. Most of the music sounds out of place in most episodes, mostly the vocal songs. Speaking of which, the themes used (Opening, insert, and ending alike), are nicely written and performed. This is probably most catchy the songs performed by Steve Conte - via "Stray" and "Heaven's not enough." The songs performed by Maaya Sakamoto, being "Gravity" - "Tell Me What the Rain Knows," retain the melancholy emotion carried in a dramatic song. Most of the time "Gravity" gets a bit tired at the end of all 30 minus episodes. 3/5 VOICE ACTING: Bandai has once again supplied another one of their animes with excellent US voice acting. Ranging from talents from the children's anime "Digimon" - Joshua Seth (Hige) and Mona Marshall (Toboe), "Outlaw Star"'s Robert Bucholz (Hubb), and Toonami's T.O.M. Steven Blum (Lord Darcia). Kiba is thankfully voiced by a talented actor Johnny Young Bosch (Vash the Stampeed, in Trigun) who's demeanor reminds me of David Boreanaz of Joss Whendon's Angel, only with less brood and more life to it. Kari Wahlgren provides an edge and character to Cher Degri who would normally be the boring ex-wife to Hubb, with a soft voice. Crispin Freeman, like Bosch, is a relatively new voice actor to me, therefore I cannot comment on past works he's done. He played Tsume with convincing charisma that would usually fall on deaf ears with too gruff of a voice if another actor was chosen. Thankfully Freeman manages to sound not so tough and human for at the same time. Lastly Tom Wyner has an excellent 'old man' voice for Yaiden. The other English va's Sherry Lynn (Cheza) and Jessica Straus (Blue) are convincing female voice actors for the limited character's their given, especially Lynn who speaks Cheza's airy-like voice with little or no annoyance (US voice acting 4/5). As for the Japanese actors, their not horrible, if anything their on par with the main US character voice actors. However, listening to Japanese gets really tiresome along with reading subtitles after a good while. Japanese audio is only good to listen to every once and a while (Japanese voice acting 3/5).  DVD: The 1st DVD contains Japanese advertisements and TV spots as well as interviews with the Japanese cast (which was rather boring in all honesty). Almost all seven DVDs contain five episodes if I remember correctly and contain all the expected anime trailers and DVD credits section that Badnai has on all their DVDs. The 5.1 Dolby digital sound for English and the 2.0 Japanese audio is excellent, never sounding dull or unbalanced for a moment. Subtitles as usual are available for the Japanese or any other language you happen to purchase this COMPLETE COLLECTION in. The animated menu featuring the Book Of The Moon was a nice touch one a last note. It all in all has a good presentation and a scores a point higher than Gundam Wing's DVD features do simply because of the content on the first DVD. 4/5 OVERALL: Wolf's Rain is an excellent anime series that was thought out pretty good considering its source in all honesty. Its something I would wanna own personally, and for someone who paid $200 dollars for a Gundam Wing BOX SET, $134.95(?) dollars is chump change when I happen to have that much in my pocket. ------- [a 4 out of 5 
A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that 
DONT watch this movie the only reason you should watch this movie is to see how bad it is they shoulda called it backstreet boys from hell even the cheesiest horror movies seem amazing compared to this its a true waste of time 
Ring of Darkness (David DeCoteau, 2004) Former porn director David DeCoteau, whose most notable mainstream flicks have been the Puppet Master franchise (he directed 3, 4, and 5, the last two under assumed names), takes an absolutely brilliant idea and makes an incredibly stupid movie out of it. Now, to be somewhat fair, not only is it a made-for-TV shlockfest, but one that certainly didn't have the budget of a Danielle Steel miniseries (IMDB estimates the film's budget at three-quarters of a million dollars). Still, it would be hard for this movie to be worse than it actually turned out; about the only thing that saves it is its premise and the fact that DeCoteau took nothing seriously. We open with Gordo (Club Dread's Greg Cipes) fleeing from a mansion. Just as he gets to the beach and seems as if he's going to get away, he's cornered by four dark shapes. Cut to an announcement that boy band Take Ten are auditioning for a new lead singer. (I'm sure you can draw the proper conclusion.) After a round of auditions, during which you're liable to get as sick of the catchy little tune they play just as much as you did any nineties boy band hit, the four remaining members of the band choose three possible replacements for Gordo-- Shawn (Guiding Light actor Coltin Scott), Jonah (DeCoteau staple Jeff Peterson), and Xavier (Baywatch's Jeremy Jackson), who are all flown, with Xavier's girlfriend Stacy (American Idol finalist Ryan Starr, whom you will be pleased to know does not sing at any point in the film), to the band's island mansion. Which, of course, looks very familiar. As the three continue the auditions in a slightly more stressful situation, weird things start happening... With all the young-and-beautiful male skin on display, you're likely to think you're watching a Victor Salva flick. However, comparisons with the superior Salva end there; DeCoteau directs as if Ring of Darkness (the title, by the way, has absolutely nothing to do with the movie itself) were his first film, not his fifty-second. I haven't seen this much obvious shot repetition in a movie since Night of the Lepus. The acting is atrocious, as one would expect from folks who cut their teeth in T (the two notable exceptions to this are Adrienne Barbeau, who plays the band's manager, and Coltin Scott), the script is bad even for a horror-flick parody, and the whole thing is just on the right side of unwatchable to keep you glued to the screen. Or maybe you just want to watch a boy band get theirs. I know that was my motivation. 
If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect: a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs. In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality. Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly. By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending. DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods 
Those of you who remember Ryan Starr from American Idol know why she quickly became "has been" material for VH1's the Surreal Life. Ryan Starr also happens to be the worst actress I have ever watched on film, television and or commercials. The director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time. Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling, expression emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails. That is all I can say, I would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again 
THIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST, SILLY, TOTALLY MISDIRECTED MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED "DISASTERS IN NATURE MOVIES". I WAS NOT DISAPOINTED. THIS WAS TRULY A HORRIFIC CATASTROPHE. THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE WAS.....WAS..... WAS.....I AM GETTING THERE.............. THE STORY HAD NO MEANING. ADRIENNE BARBEAU SHOULD SELL RAFFLE TICKETS THE NEXT TIME SHE NEEDS MONEY. HER TALENTS WERE TOTALLY WASTED. HERS WAS THE ONLY TALENTS BEING WASTED; NO ONE ELSE IN THE MOVIE HAD ANY. THIS DVD ALSO WILL DO NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, AS IT IS GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE. IF RYAN STARR WANTS AN OSCAR SHE'D BETTER START BY ASKING HIM OUT ON A DATE, BECAUSE JULIA ROBERTS AND HALLE BERRY HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTIME SOON. SHE DOES HAVE POTENTIAL THOUGH. THERE WAS NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THE BAND MEMBERS. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THEIR ACTIONS. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR OF THIS SEWAGE ON SCREEN 
I think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies (it is right up there with movies like "half-caste"). This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably. It will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork. Oh and did I mention it was bad 
I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love 
Bland, bland, and more bland. It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark. With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable. And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way. It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
Edge of Seventeen is a very enjoyable movie. I found myself rewatching it over and over again. Theres nothing to spectacular about it. Its just a typical coming out and coming to terms movie. I just found that the main character is very sweet and charming in a innocent way. The plot was very st8 foward and basic with a few little tid bits to living it up. The film was made in the 80s and is a bit dated. But if you just want to see a decent film concerning the gay lifestyle or coming out this definatly buy this film. You wont be dissapointed 
This is one of the most well written and performed movies about coming out I've seen up to this very moment.It has the same sincere and heartwarming candor of its hetero counterpart SIXTEEN CANDLES. Though the story takes place in the late eighties its themes are timeles and universal for any queer youth and enlightened hetero's as well.Enjoy 
Movie: ***** DVD Quality: ***** DVD Extras: *** Dramas about _Teenage Gays Coming Out Of The Closet!_ are so plentiful, they sometimes run together in my mind. "Edge of Seventeen" is an exception to that statement because it genuinely is an exceptional movie in every way. The screenplay by Todd Stephens is sensitive and true to life, or rather, many people's lives. It tells the story of Eric (Chris Stafford), a young man growing up in the small town of Sandusky, Ohio, who is just beginning to grapple with his sexual orientation. What is so refreshing about the script is that Eric is portrayed as neither a victim nor a hero; he's simply a kid on the cusp of adulthood who is trying to find himself. Eric is sometimes selfish and thoughtless; other times sweet and naive; occasionally manipulative; but generally a good guy ... in other words: completely human. That holds true of the other characters in the movie, including Eric's parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what to make of his fast-changing moods and appearance; his female best friend (Tina Holmes) who harbors deeper feelings for him; and his new gay "family" (headed by Lea DeLaria) who are fiercely supportive, yet sometimes insensitive to where he is at in terms of his coming out process. Thankfully, Stephens' screenplay remains true to itself right down to the final fadeout and doesn't cop out by trying to wrap everything up into a neat little package; at the end of the movie, there's a definite sense that these characters will continue to live, learn, make mistakes, and thrive. (Sequel, anyone?) The entire cast is uniformly outstanding. Chris Stafford embodies Eric in all his complexity; his performance never strikes a false note. Tina Holmes is amazing as his confused female friend; more than once her face and vocal inflections reminded me of an extremely young Meryl Streep (a high compliment indeed). Stephanie McVay distinguishes herself as Eric's baffled mother, and Andersen Gabrych is fine as Eric's first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers a troubled heart. Perhaps best of all is comic Lea DeLaria, who turns in a warm and winning dramatic performance as the Earth Mother whose wisdom and understanding are always available to Eric, regardless of how hard he sometimes pushes her away. The Strand DVD offers a flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio and video. The somewhat sparse extras are limited to the Theatrical Trailers for "Edge of Seventeen" and five other feature films designed to appeal to LGBT audiences. It would be wonderful to have the additional benefit of cast and crew biographies and filmographies as a reasearch tool for the viewers who want to explore others works by the filmmakers, but this is a small complaint. Overall, this is truly a must-see film, one that is worthy of repeat viewings. 
This is a great movie about a teenage boy coming to terms with his sexuality. It is by turns moving and heart-rending as the boy makes his way through adolescence, a difficult time for any teen. This often-painful period in a boy's life is further complicated by his conflicted sexuality. This will bring back strong memories, good and bad, for any gay man who has lived this story. Chris Stafford shines in the lead role, aided by sensitive performance by the entire cast. Great use of costumes and make-up as the boy changes over time. Don't miss this one! 
This is one of the best gay films that I have seen. It is touching without being sappy, and realistic without going overboard. In many ways, the story parallels my own life growing up gay in the midwest during the eighties. The main character is so sweet and innocent. It just makes you want to root for him, and you can't help but feel his angst as he struggles to discover and accept himself. Beautifully done, and extremely well acted. Bravo! 
I lived this and felt like my diary was being read outloud to everyone I knew and didn't know. My God what an excellent way to show the true pain of confussion, love, lust and terror all rolled into one young gay man. Wow, I could not believe how this movie made me feel from start to finish. I hope that young gay boys and even girls find strength in this film. A++ 
i placed two orders from this same seller for the same dvd and both came in very quickly in excellent condition there were no problems with making my payment or anything else thank you very much will be looking forward to ordering from you agan. i got two of the same video cuz my daughter wanted her own copy and needed one for the house als 
some the true lives of chicano/a in the california / texas etc area enjoyable 
Great movie, definately original and something many Chicanos living is SoCal can relate to or be familiar with 
I saw this movie Yeaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrs ago and the title popped into my head. This is such an intense film, the acting is very well performed. The characters, the plot, everything surrounding this film was well thought-out and organized. Definite 5 stars 
My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004. It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played. I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever! As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence 
When I first saw this film, some five years ago, it truly knocked the breath out of me. For the first time, director Allison Anders gives us a glimpse into Mexican-American gang life in East LA's Echo Park, from the female perspective, this time. In the past, we have seen our share of male experiences (example being Zoot Suit, written by the playwright Luis Valdez). For once, we see the gritty side of the gang life, as young Mexicanas (or Chicanas, depending on who you ask) struggle to stay alive, amidst rampant drug dealing, the violence of gang initiation and their relationships with men who are less than honorable to them. Mi Vida Loca is actually a trilogy of stories. (Mousie Sad Girl, Lowrider and La Blue Eyes) The first is the story of a life long friendship between fellow gang members, Mousie (Seidy Lopez) and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles). These young women are best friends, until the day that Sad Girl sleeps with Mousie's boyfriend, Ernesto (Jacob Vargas), and becomes pregnant with his child. The world they knew before is ruptured, as is their lifelong connection as friends. The second story takes a glimpse in LowRider culture. This culture is perpetuated by, predominantly, young Chicanos who build their lives around re-finishing and airbrushing "low rider" cars (many, old school Chevies), complete with flashy airbrush images (example being voluptuous women and gang affiliations), trick tires and rims. This story is actually a wonderful example of modern magical realism, when the car takes on a life of its own. The third story is centered around La Blue Eyes, a beautiful BROWN-EYED woman who is writing to a convict, that she falls in love with through the exchange of letters. The question is, when they finally meet, will the sum of those letters even measure up to their encounter, or has the young woman ultimately been deceived, the whole time? I reccomend this film, if not for the fact that it is compelling, but that this is an important culture in society we should all learn something more about. A very important study in gang life, and how it evolves in a neighborhood that many only hear about on the evening news, but never get to know 
I love this movie!!! it is the best movie ever!!!!!!!!! it has so many things that poor hispanics and go through. Its kind of sterotypical but it is still a good movie!!! Yeah it is kinda of rough but it shows so much reality. It has sooooooo much drama and things just happen so randomly. I love this movie i would watch it every day if i could!! 
I love this movie i can relate to it in soo many ways...thats where i got my nickname(giggles).I can really relate to Sad Girl .My friends and i all love this movie cant stop watching it..we all relate to it, like mousie,sadgirl,whisper,sleepy,ernesto,blueeyes.We enjoy it.Every one should see it because the stuff that happen do happen in real life 
This movie reminds me of back in the dayz, growing up in Kali, I enjoyed because it puts out there the issues chicana girls have growing up, for other people that don't quite get Chicana Life this movie will help you understand, even though now in dayz it's not that harsh, growing up in city like L.A , the barrio is your familia if you want to survive the gang streets.... a must see movie overall!!! Chicana Love, La Travies 
this is a real good movie. better than american me in my opinion. when i first bought it i thought it would be okay but it turned out to be better than i thought. its about 2 best friends who turn on eachother after they both get pregnant by tha same drug dealer. after he dies they later realize always choose ur homegirl before any boy. tha story goes on about other events. tha only thing i didnt like about it was that i thought it ended too early. other than that this is a real good movie.. 
This is a bad movie, plain and simple. There are few films more boring and badly acted than this one. Rent it or borrow it if you must but save yourself the money, you'll regret purchasing this film. This is just a self-promotion vehicle gone bad 
I was amased at how very well acted, directed and written this movie was. The dialogue was sharp and you might have to watch twice to get all the subtle quips. Everyone was well cast. It is great movie for anyone and transcends the lesbo-film cliche. It transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it's a "gay" movie. If you hated "Go Fish" like I did, you'll love this movie and go "whew" for this film - it saves our lesbian cinema souls! Buy it! you won't be sorr 
What were those people who gave this 5 stars watching? If you want to see two people jabbering for 80 minutes this is it. This was adapted from a play, but still... This would be an "F" in any High School play. I want my 80 minutes and $20 back 
I really enjoyed the way the director incorporated the play, which the movie was based on, into the movie. The acting was great, and the love story was touching. I loved to see a real life lesbian couple playing the roles based on a real life account of their own story. Dom Deluise and Mink Stole were hilarious, and I highly recommend this movie 
Whatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie. Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and "sparks fly." As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe. From the movie's self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless: Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians? Do the production's other members? Does that derail the production? What mayhem ensues? In point of fact, however, the single attempt at "comedy" comes from DeLuise's portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats. The bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the "actresses" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers. Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore. The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic. There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders. About the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street. Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters. Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves. If so, then this IS bad acting. If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances. Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film. 
I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The layered reality (writers playing writers playing actors playing themselves) keeps you on your toes. The cinematic device of organic storytelling is enhanced by cutaways in both time and space to scenes of what we are to assume is each character's present reality outside the theater at the time when the story takes place back to the image of the storytellers in a narrative about these events that have already taken place, and again out to their experience coming to knowone another under Dom DeLuise's direction in the same theater (in the past). Really, it's an interesting device.  Production values are high and this film is pretty funny. . .and sexy. . .and revealing. While I wouldn't necessarily call it cinematic genius, gay movies dealing with any kind of plot beyond coming out are few and far between. This film is very much about relationships-how they fall apart and how they are born. The fact that these are lesbian relationships is just the cherry 
I rented this movie for about six dollars and I have to say even that was a waste of money. I thought this movie was incredibly over acted, boring and hard on the eyes. The thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did. They were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial. For the superficial people out there I wouldn't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won't get it. When I found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible. I have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment 
This is the worst lesbian movie I have ever seen - way worse than Claire of the Moon, which was pretty bad. I read the reviews so I bought it but I won't do that to some other sucker. Bad acting, bad story line, unattractive women, no hot scenes whatsoever. Don't waste one red cent on this one 
The first time I saw this flick, I did not like it. It was so unusual in how it was done. Yes, I have been to numerous plays on Broadway but that is where I expect to see them. Then, I watched the making of it and learned about how it was based on truth and for whatever reason, I watched it again and came to appreciated it from it a different light. Why I could not do that the first time I don't know. This may sound strange but overall I really enjoyed it and highly recommend that if you don't like it the first time, at least watch the making of it. I ended up buying the movie 
When I first viewed "Jurassic Park" in a theatre on Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles, I actually walked out. It wasn't so much because of the film, but the speaker system in the theatre were so darn loud, I thought I was back on an Air Force flightline. I actually had to cover my ears it was so irritating. And I was not alone, many others got up to leave too. This film has been discussed to the point that I don't believe there is anything further I can add. However, I am not a big dinosaur film type person. [I really like archaelogy, and Paleantology, however, as one who is not a specialist, but through an interest in the past]. However, when I viewed the film again, on DVD, I found the film pretty darn interesting and a very fun watch. It was exciting, and the dinosaurs were done very well. And more importantly, what I liked about the film is how the scientific community, [at lest one rich man in particular who is funding them], shows their disrespect and arrogance for nature, and the [natural selection] by interfering with what is best left alone. This was delved into in a very enlightening and interesting way in the film. I highly recommend the film, if you have young pre-teens, or teenagers [as I do] they will enjoy the film. It is action packed and a very suspenseful film. Especially the dinosaur scenes. Recommended. 
JURASSIC PARK is one of the best, if not the best, movies made about dinosaurs ever. It's also one of only a handful of movies ever made based on a novel that was already in preproduction before the novel ever was released. It's also one of the first movies to use CGI in significant scenes throughout the film. It's also the movie that gave Sam Neill a break and reinvigorated the career of Jeff Goldblum. The movie (promoted by the release of the novel about a year earlier) got the general public (and not just kids) excited about dinosaurs again and did to paleontology as a major what RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK did to archaeology. The premise, seeped in pop science, is that a multi-billionaire, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) brings dinosaurs back to life by cloning the dino-DNA taken from mosquitoes trapped in amber. He builds a zoological theme-park he calls Jurassic Park. However, in order to call off a bunch of lawyers after an accident with one of the park's workers, Hammond has to get a group of scientific experts to endorse that the park is safe and viable. Thus, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) arrive to tour the facilities. Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello), are also along for the ride as test subjects. Due to a hurricane and the shenanigans of a greedy employee, the park experiences a major breakdown and the dinosaurs get loose. JURASSIC PARK set records upon its initial release in 1993 and it isn't difficult to see why. The CGI effects that have become common in just about every movie since then were in their infancy then, yet the creatures appear completely lifelike. Of course, Spielberg not only used CGI but he had some live action dinos and models involved as well. It was a massive undertaking, but one that had a huge payoff. There's not much to complain about with JURASSIC PARK. Sam Neill is great as Dr. Grant (the role was originally offered to Harrison Ford and I'm actually glad he turned it down) and Jeff Goldblum is almost always a delight to watch on screen. After 15 years of directing his own movies, Richard Attenborough came back for the perfect part as John Hammond. The action sequences in the film are still as exciting to watch as they were when the film first was in theatres. The movie is classic Spielberg and those are some of the best movies ever made. This DVD includes a very informative documentary about the making of JURASSIC PARK, some clips from an early production meeting (it's probably the closest an average person can come to meeting the real Spielberg), some storyboards and other illustrations, Phil Tippett's Animatic of the "Raptors in the Kitchen" sequence showing the raptors as they were originally conceived with having lizard-like tongues, trailers for all three JURASSIC PARK movies, a dinosaur encyclopedia featuring the dinosaurs seen in the movie, some production notes, and a list and partial filmography of the cast crew 
I read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards. A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold's arm drops on Ellie's shoulder as she's trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There have been countless lines I've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession. And after watching it more than 25 times, I've come to appreciate it more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob. He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well. Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right. "Life finds a way..." (In Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions, and "random" --unpredictable-- events result from the "normal" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce, "survive," in a single-sex environment. And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.) Love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet. We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class. I've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be there for each tour?). The kids were kind of annoying. I didn't notice this until I was a little older, but Lex ("I prefer to be called a hacker") uses Silicon Graphics' 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park. Their logo is on the monitor. If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now... Anyway, the soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought, back in the mid-90s. Tonya Harding skated to the theme at the 1994 Olympics, or some other competition. I only liked her because of her excellent music choice 
First off, special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality. But at least this is better than the abomination that was JAWS. The only dinosaur movie I can think of that's worse than this is RAPTOR, which consists of parts of the three Carnosaur movies cut pasted together. It has some redeeming feature in that Ian Malcom and John somedoy (I forget his last name... the guy who owns the park) were actually interesting characters. I guess Steve Speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey's rear end about. Unfortunately, the boring, stereotypical Alan Grant was the central character in this. If you want to watch a Steven Spielburg movie that's actually good, watch E.T. or something. Or "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (even though recommending a sequel may seem lame, the sequel is a million times better than this) If you want to see a dinosaur movie, then watch either the sequel to this movie, or Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World". I would also recomend the 'Carnosaur' movies but I think they're out of print. If you want to see a movie where Sam Neill plays an interesting chracter, watch 'In the Mouth of Madness' or 'Triangle' But definitely avoid this movie. The only reason I even own it is because it was sold in a box set with "The Lost World: Jurassic Park 
This movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great. The action scenes are particularly terrifying; particularly when the T-Rex breaks through the fence; also, when the raptors hunt for the two obnoxious kids in the kitchen -- too bad I was rooting for the raptors. But still, these scenes in particular were very, very real, very scary and pulse-pounding! It's equally interesting to judge what didn't work in this movie: the characters, not quite as weak as those in the book but close; many of the computer generated shots looked surprisingly fake; and of course the bulk of the book's great science got lost. But still, none of this really matters that much. The scary scenes were awfully scary! Those dinosaurs looked REAL! I can watch those scenes over and over and over again; so owning a quality DVD like this makes it easy! If you don't have it already, Give it a shot! 
'Jurassic Park' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'Best Picture' nod at the oscars. Now, some of you may not agree, and then some of you may. I feel that 'Jurassic Park' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen. Adapted (loosly) from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name 'Jurassic Park' delivers a solid script, solid acting and SOLID thrills that can not and will not be repeated (as is proven by the failed attempts in 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original) Before the doors to the Amusement Park to end all Amusement Parks is opened, the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look. Amoung these experts is a Mathematician (Goldbloom) and dino-experts/Paleontologists (Dern and Neill). Of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit (or I should say a lot) skeptical, but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned. The film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog, and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people, creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive. One of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise. This is the film to beat 
This movie is the bomb! I had such a great time with this movie! Jurassic Park has always been great! The videogames where great! And I loved the soundtrack! If you have seeen my other reviews you will know I love a movie with a great soundtrack. And this one got it! Hey who dosent like Dino action? Over to your left there are man eating dinos they are gonna shread you! So much action! This movie couldent get any better! Well if they somehow got lost in the city it would be the bomb! But hey this movie is great! I had a great time and you will too 
I'm trying to decide which of the three I love the best, but all should be part of one's home library. I often view them while I'm on my exercise bike and always pedal faster! It's easy to forget you're sweating while watching people on the screen being chased by dinosaurs. Perhaps gyms across the country should invest in the Jurassic Park movie collection? Chrissy K.

Normally I love documentaries. I've watched hundreds of them and with one exception I have loved them all. However, OUTFOXED is the single most boring film I have ever seen. A relentless rant against Rupert Murdoch's cable news station, this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with Fox News, but I cannot imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in Fox News to remain awake while watching this movie. Watching OUTFOXED makes me realize what a genius Michael Moore is. Whether you love him or hate him, whether you agree with him or not, you have to admit his films are entertaining. This film, however, is a major bore. - Regina McMenami 
I think it's pretty obvious that FOX is a thinly-veiled shill for right wing political views, but I suppose there are people out there who are fooled and think it's actually a legitimate news source. This film was interesting as it really shows all the subtle little tricks FOX uses as well as some of the blatent ones and behind the scenes agenda-setting from higher-up. If youare already on to FOX's rubbish, you won't be shocked -- but ...? I must admit it is interesting to see how their tactics affect other news sources. 
Outfoxed is a propaganda pure and simple. It is made by left-wingers and is prejudicial, if not more so, than the Fox News. It is made by people who see some kind of Great Right Wing Conspiracy in the media. It is made by people who like to silence any fair exchange of ideas and who want to dominate the news cycle with their contrived and simplistic stories that left-wing Democrats are the good guys and right-wing Republicans are monsters who want to molest children, take away lunch programs, and discriminate against women and minorities. People who praise this film think it meets some kind of standard of real journalism, but it doesn't. It is not necessary to pretend that it is anything other than what it is. It is a propaganda film as was Triumph of the Will. The ersatz "journalists" behind this anti-Fox diatribe are objecting to the fact that there are conservative opinion shows on Fox news channel. They don't like that some News channel would give a voice to conservative opinions because that makes it more difficult for them to achieve their own hidden agendas. The would prefer that if you have to put conservative voices on the airways you surround that one voice with five or six liberal voices to keep it in check and to make it appear that the conservative voice is an out of the mainstream of American political life point of view. The propagandists behind this film deliberately confuse that fact with the fact that there are also news programs on Fox. It is the necessary plot of their lame story line. People who praise this film as some kind of real journalism, either don't understand the difference or are themselves political hacks. The bottom line is that they are jealous that Fox has been successful at what it does, and that they are nothing but failures at what they do. 
I'll admit that I've never been a fan of FOX news. The few times I've watched it, I've been annoyed by its glossy, glitzy sensationalist approach to the news. Well, so much for that--I prefer to get my news via the internet. But the documentary OUTFOXED from director Robert Greenwald argues that FOX news is more than just a tacky news programme. According to the filmmaker, the FOX channel--owned by right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch--pipes propaganda into millions of homes throughout the world. The documentary includes many interviews from former FOX television employees--some left, some were sacked, and some were eased out. But they all have the same story--participate in the party line, or you're out. Internal FOX memos are shown detailing how presenters are prompted to play up certain events and kill other stories. Various media watchdogs also appear--including Peter Hart from Fairness and Accuracy on Reporting (FAIR)--and these interviewees analyze the techniques FOX applies to its programming. And these techniques range from dirty (smear campaigns), nasty, hate mongering, and intimidation (Bill O'Reilly) to downright tricky. One of the best portions of the film shows O'Reilly 'interviewing' Jeremy Glick, the son of a man killed on 9-11. When Glick dares to voice an opinion, O'Reilly rudely shouts down his guest, and then subsequent footage show how the guest's comments were horribly distorted over an 11-month period. According to the film, FOX news has its share in the responsibility of the fear mongering that took place in the build-up to the war. As part of a concerted Strategy of Tension, FOX hyped fears. After watching some of the footage, I was surprised the news presenters didn't sink to wearing gas masks while on air. In one segment, a former CIA agent--a guest on FOX--tells host Hannity that he's concerned that America may have problems with wars on two fronts--Iraq and Afghanistan. Hannity makes an inane comment and compares this situation to walking and chewing gum at the same time. It's obvious that the guest's comments are being managed (cut) in a way to limit his point. But when one considers the responsibility FOX should have to offer accurate and fair news reporting, it makes me wonder how some people responsible for this nonsense can sleep at night. In one sequence, there's a news snippet stating that it's safer for soldiers on the streets of Iraq than it is living in California. I would have laughed out loud at this rubbish if it weren't so disgusting. (Earth-to-FOX news--no one in California has been blown up by IEDs.) But what's particularly upsetting is that millions of people who watch this stuff don't seem to realize that FOX has "eliminated journalism" and has instead become a mouthpiece for right-wing propaganda. According to one interviewee, FOX audiences tend to have comparatively "incorrect assumptions" about some of the myths of the Iraq war when compared to PBS/NPR audiences. On the down side, FOX television aficionados probably won't get much out of this documentary--whereas those of us who chose to not watch FOX will be appalled. But perhaps watching this documentary will help some of us Non-FOX channel people understand where some of the hare-brained brainwashing comes from when our neighbours and workmates begin to spout their propaganda--displacedhuma 
This is a must for every person that watches TV news to get general knowledge. I have suspected it before I bought this DVD, but now it has been backed up by some credible evidence. Watch this DVD with an open mind. 
Pundits would have you believe that Fox news and Rupert Murdoch are the antithesis of quality journalism. They even based a Bond villian on Murdoch in one ofe the more forgettable movies. Nothing gets a liberal's eyes rolling than when you say you watch Fox News. This Attackumentary wants you to believe that Fox is biased and not credible. Watch this Attackumentary and listen for yourself to what they are saying and draw your own conclusions. The former reporters gripe throughout this "piece" that Rupert Murdoch changed how reporters operate, for the worse in their opinion. What actually happened is that these reporters had to work for a change. They had to work hard, something they probably never did before. Murdoch, like any driven person, demanded nothing less than excellence from his employees. Those that could hang, rose with Fox news. Those that could not keep up appear in "OutFoxed". Fox does have a bias on its commentary section. This draws ratings. The thing that the pundits seem to have a problem with is separating the Journalism from the Commentary sections even with Fox putting a big sign up saying "Commentary". They are so used to their "Mainstream" liberal journalists blending their personal views and possibly slipping in actual news that they cannot tell the difference anymore. Here is my latest scorecard: Mainstream Media: Latest and greatest from Reuters, a major supplier of news to the always objective "mainstream media"; fired a reporter for falsifying photos to show violence worse than actually happened. This photographer decided that his photos (or the war) was not alarming enough so he added a few more smoke plumes and darkened the overall image. How many other war photos have been doctored this way? On the Reuters' news page there is no mention of this deliberately manufactured garbage. You had to go to their main page and look way over to the right side to find the story. I guess they still have enough shame to be embarassed about this incident. The bastion of liberal "non-thinking"; New York Times has had several reporters writing stories about events that they did not actually do background work on. In other words, they phoned in their stories without any actual knowledge of the events. They also revealed secrets that hurt the World's efforts on fighting terrorists. CNN - Nicknamed the Clinton News Network during the 90's for swallowing anything the Clintons had to give and asking for seconds, the only thing they were upset about during the whole Lewinsky scandal was that they wanted to be the ones under the desk. On their online "News Headlines" section they repeatedly have Lou Dobb's column appear mixed in with news as if what he says is news. Lou Dobb's is the paid liberal mouthpiece for CNN and everything he states is opinion not news. You would think they would put him on their opinion section but unlike Fox they don't have one. They think it is perfectly all right to mix opinion with news. USA Today breaks a huge story on a massive phone tapping scandal. Oops, turns out it wasn't as massive as it seemed and the data was given voluntarily. Over 70% of the American population agreed with the Bush administration on this move despite his otherwise low approval rating. CBS's Dan Rather, this is the man man who nearly wept on camera when the Republican revolution swept through Congress in 1994. All his hopes of a liberal presidency were washed away. He launched a smear campaign against President Bush using the worst journalistic standards imaginable. His background investigation was nil. People discredited this story almost instantly and yet he persisted on reporting it. After everything was said and done he still tried everything in his power to prevent having to recant. The editor for the Los Angeles times had to put out a memo to his people to try not to be so biased during the 2004 election. Finally there is Newsweek, whose irresponsible reporting was the direct cause of riots that led to a score of deaths and untold injuries. They were so eager to report the desecration of Islam's holy writ that they failed to see if it actually happened. They ended up recanting with a pseudo apology that laid the blame on everyone but themselves. The blood may wash off easy but do the memories and guilt remain? That is a question the reporters and the editors can only answer. If so, that is the punishment you deserve for abusing one of the most important and influential professions in the World. Perhaps others will think twice before fanning the flames of hatred just to sell a few more issues. These are just minor examples of how the "Mainstream" Media operates. These are real stories and influence real events in the world, sometimes with serious consequences. This is not the same as news commentators spouting off at the mouth about an issue of the day. If you want more then read the book Bias by Bernard Goldberg to get a real understanding. I will stick to Fox News as I have yet to find a major scandal regarding how they report the news. Like any prudent person I take my news from a variety of sources and choose for myself on how to interpret what it all means. I do take news with a grain of salt if it is coming from sources that have proven they are more interested in being first than in being correct. CNN, Reuters, CBS, Newsweek, NY Times all fall squarely into the "dubious at best" category. All I have gotten from this attackumentary is a bunch of liberals and hack reporters whining because Fox separates the opinions from the facts,allowing people to decide for themselves how they want to interpret the news and America loves them for it. The liberals hate Fox news. Fox actually investigates and reports on what happened; not what the liberals wished would have happened. They show the liberals for what they are, full of $%$^. They hated it when Fox repeatedly showed then President Clinton walking in a funeral procession laughing it up, that is until he saw a TV camera and started shedding crocodile tears. Fox news made the general public aware that the budget successes of the 90's was due mostly to Newt Gingrich. Clinton had a disastrous first 2 years of his presidency. Gingrich's congress would not send Clinton the pork barrel projects so he couldn't spend to excess. I wish we had Gingrich leading the congress doing the same to President Bush. I am sure Rupert Murdoch is feeling "Outfoxed"; right now his network is ranked numero Uno as it has been for some time. This DVD is hovering between 2000 and 3000. I am ranked higher than it is. 
Fox News promotes itself as fair and balanced, when what it is biased and unbalanced. This DVD provides mountains of evidence in the form of video segments that contradict official statements that the network is unbiased and even handed. Particularly galling is the Jeremy Glick segment, presented in its entirety here. O'Reilly puts words in Glick's mouth, and later segments is seen claiming that his own lies about Glick are Glick's actual sentiments. This is reprehensible.  It's an unflinching depiction of the Republican Party's mouthpiece. 
Leave it to the Coen Brothers to make Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle the crux of a film noir, and darned if they don't make a good case for it in "The Man Who Wasn't There." (Typically, they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who can't even remember Heisenberg's name.) Chain-smoking nebbish barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) makes the only decisive (and dishonest) action of his life, and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several, mostly not-so-innocent, bystanders. In "The Man Who Wasn't There," the phrase "decisive action" is an oxymoron; everything Crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance. Everything that happens--from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face--changes everything forever, and always for the worse. Set in 1949 in Santa Rosa, Calif. (a tip of the hat to Hitchcock and "Shadow of a Doubt," perhaps?) "The Man Who Wasn't There" looks perfect. Like every other Coen film, it's a marvel of production design, and the genius photographer Roger Deakins nails to a tree the dusty black-and-white look of such classic noirs as "Double Indemnity" and "Out of the Past." Thematically, however, "The Man Who Wasn't There" resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant, much better acted remake of Edgar G. Ulmer's "Detour," in which the characters drift in a low-rent Sartrean hell, totally the victims of fate. But whereas "Detour" is more than the sum of its parts, "The Man Who Wasn't There" is less. The Coen Brothers may believe in chance, but on the screen they leave nothing to chance, so that everything in "The Man Who Wasn't There" is TOO perfect. In the end the film has the same overstudied, clinical quality that afflicts every Coen film except "Fargo." (It must be admitted, though, that only one Coen film--"The Hudsucker Proxy"--is ruined by that quality.) The acting is as superb as in any Coen film. Thornton--in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together--burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense, hangdog gravity. There are also glittering supporting performances by Frances McDormand as Thornton's philandering wife Doris; James Gandolfini as her paramour and boss; Jon Polito as a shady businessman; Michael Badalucco as Thornton's motormouth brother-in-law; Scarlett Johansson as the teenager Thornton chastely fancies; and especially Tony Shalhoub, nearly stealing the picture as Freddy Riedenschneider, defense attorney extraordinaire. 
This is an excellent film. Billy Bob is a clean-vut barber who keeps to himself. His wife married him because she liked that he didn't talk very much. It is a tragedy of epic proportions, with great performances from all involved. The only thing for me that holds this back from being a FIVE STAR film is the fact that in EVERY SINGLE SCENE someone lights up a cigarette or is taking deep drags on one. That alone justifies this film's "R" rating. When watching this film, it seems that they are encouraging people to be "cool" and that smoking is a pleasurable thing. The most notorious moment for me is when Frances McDormand is sitting in the bathtub and asks her barber husband (Billy Bob) to shave her legs. He walks in somberly with a cigarette drooping from his lips and she tells him to give her a drag. This is a putrid moment that just drove me crazy! But then, that is just my opinion. Overall, the film could have been as good and greater if it did not have the incessant smoking throughout. The plot is slow yet intensely emotional. If you don't mind smoking, then you will probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy. If you are as strongly opposed to smoking or have children who are interested in seeing this, you should review the film before letting them see it 
I really enjoyed this film, basically the Coen Bros. homage to the film noir genre. (I always thought the name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc. :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then. Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a disappointment. 
Other reviewers consider this move the Coen Brothers' best. Before viewing this film I had seen only "Miller's Cossing" and "Fargo". I still prefer Fargo but acknowledge that this movie is a special kind of masterpiece. With few exceptions, I usually do not like films based on unsympathetic characters (one reason I prefer "Fargo"). However, this film's exclusive assortment of unlikeable and unprincipled chaqracters creates the perfect springboard for the unintended chain of violent consequences resulting from a opportunistic premeditated act of revenge by a bizzarely laconic barber, all of which are meant to illustrate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The excellent acting of the cast gives depth to otherwise banal characters in such a way that suggests that they could have been different has they chosen otherwise. I didn't particularly like the convenient and superfluous inclusion of UFOs in the storyline and thought it unnecessarily weakend an almost flawless plot line. The behavior of the teenage girl at the end of the story was too abrupt and, in general I felt that the significance of her character should have been better developed. 
While the Beethoven-heavy score plays, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) intones, "Yeah, I worked in a barber shop. But I never considered myself a barber." A perfect opening line for one of the Coens' greatest movies. Ed has resigned himself to cutting hair and living with his distant wife Doris (Frances McDormand), who is having an affair with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini). When an opportunity opens up involving dry cleaning, Ed decides to try to control over his destiny and ends up being punished for this, in the finest film noir tradition. As usual from the Coens, this is a darkly comic, cleverly plotted noir, but the unusual for the Coens (aside from the voice-over narration and the gorgeous black and white cinematography) is the depth of feeling in this movie. Although a cipher to everyone around him, Ed is, to the viewer, a decent guy who simply doesn't belong in his life. It's impossible not to feel empathy for this guy. This entire movie bears his essence, from the methodical, deliberate plotting to the smoky, restrained black and white. The Coens have really thought this one through, and the result is marvelous. Clearly not for everyone, but Thornton's depiction of disaffected alienation is brilliant and not to be missed for fans of the Coen Brother 
This may be the best Cohn brothers' movie yet. Stellar performances by all, and a plot that contains no loose ends adds up to a great nouveau film-noir flick that shows what could happen when an unsuspecting man starts to travel down the wrong road. The ending is almost transcendant. This is the kind of movie Albert Camus might have made if her were a film writer and director. 
I think you have to see this movie a second time to fully appreciate it. There is alot of subtlties that I didn't pick up on until I watched it again years later. All the acting was fantastic. A standout performance for the actor who played the "salesman" at the hotel. Weird-a-rama!!! The movie ends up being completely freaky and surreal, and ya got to have a warped mind to fully grasp the surrealness of the Coen Brothers. Strange-a-rama......... 
This review is for the 2002 Universal DVD. The story is set in the late 1940's, where a small town barber named Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) concocts a slick blackmail scheme targeting his cheating wife Doris (Frances McDormand) and her boss 'Big Dave' Brewster (James Gandolfini). After the payoff, Big Dave figures out that Ed set him up and a violent fight ensues where one of them is murdered. The cops arrest of the wrong person and a big city lawyer named Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Schalhoub) is hired to defend the accused. This sets up the rest of the film for plenty of unexpected twists and turns along with a lot of subtle comedy. The Coen Brothers now have a long resum of wonderful films and this by far my personal favorite since there are many things that work brilliantly in this movie. First, the black and white cinematography strikingly captures the mood and feel of a late 1940's film. Second, the deadpan narration and stoic body language by Billy Bob Thorton is mesmerizing. Third, the attention to detail of the props, decorating and fashion styles is done to perfection. Fourth, the plot is slick and original. Finally, the comedy is as dark as the dead of night, but works magically in this bizarre and macabre atmosphere. I enthusiastically recommend this film - especially if you enjoy old film-noir flicks. The DVD widescreen black white presentation is superb, as it should be, since the movie was shot in 2001. There are many bonus features including commentary by the director Joel Coen and actor Billy Bob Thorton. Movie: A+ DVD Quality: A 
The Man Who Wasn't There is a movie by the always unpredictable Coen brothers. Their movies have such a great variety of topics and genre that it's fun to see what they've come up with next. Out of the ones I've seen, my thoughts are mixed. I mean how can you make a goofball hilarious comedy like Raising Arizona, then one of the best movies of all time with Fargo and then go terribly wrong from there? Then you've got the Big Lebowski, a movie with a huge cast and huge amounts of cussing and huge amounts of weirdness. Not what I call a good movie. Then there's the Ladykillers, a ridculous and stupid movie that was a pathetic atempt at doing anything. So they're just getting worse by age, right? Wait! Let's go back two years to 2001. It was in this year that this unheard of movie was made. Of course, its originality was probably too intense for most people to handle. And that's the beauty of this gem. The cinematography. The look of this world and the 1940s feel it's good is brilliant. But it's the shadows you see and this cinematography that makes it stand on its own. It is a beautiful movie for that reason and for many others. But first, let's talk about the plot of the movie. Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thorton) is living in California in the 40s with his wife, Doris (Frances McDormand). Doris is part of a community that talks and talks. But not Ed. Ed narrates this story...his story. He sees it in black and white or maybe that's the way it really is. You've got to think. Ed is a barber and is proud of his job. He only says a few remarks orally but we hear all of the thoughts in his head through his narration. So here, there is some more originality, brilliance and beauty. When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini), he reacts with harshness. He blackmails Big Dave but something goes wrong. Big Dave finds out and Ed kills him out of defense. And this all happens in the first 30 minutes. Doris is accused of doing it and from then on, you're in for a real treat. When Ed isn't narrating, like I already said, he isn't talking. So what he does is smoke, cut hair and listen to a young girl nicknamed Birdy (Scarlett Johansson) play piano. Her tunes flow through his head all the time and that adds some more beauty. Tony Shaloub steals the show in his role as lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider. He's a big shot who talks and talks. Keep an eye out for for his awesome speech with the "you don't know" repeated a bunch of times. Believe me, you'll know when you're hearing it. The movie is a sad and tragic tale, a tale showing how badly one man's life can go in a world that isn't for him. He's different. It's like he is wearing a hot pink shirt and everyone else is wearing a blue one...he stands out because he's different. The Man Who Wasn't There is hands down an excellent movie. It is a close second to Fargo in the Coen's movies. My last point is that the rating association gets on my nerves. This movie is rated R for a scene of violence? Is that a joke? That scene was in black and white and showed NOTHING! You people really have no idea what you're doing. Pulp Fiction (R)=The Man Who Wasn't There (R) Get it straight people, your ratings are horrid. James Bond flicks have worse content than this. 
When is coming out the next sesson I can't wait!!! It is with out a doubt one of the best miniseries I have seen in a long time 
This television series is one of the best running. The resurrection of Battlestar Galactica by the work of the cast and crew of BSG make it the best series on television and on DVD. The way the scripts run and the action it makes the viewers "chomping at the bit" for the next episode. 2.5 is great the expanded Pegasus episodes are worth the purchase alone. The action in the episiodes and the quality of the dvd's are second to none 
Another great DVD set for television's BEST TV DRAMA! A must-buy just for the extended version of season-opener 'PEGASUS' where you are able to get a little more in-depth about Admiral Kane and the entire Pegasus crew .. .. MUSTY BUY FOR A MUST-SEE DRAMA!! 
You hear it about a lot of shows, but Battlestar Galactica really is the best show on television currently and has taken the science fiction genre truly to a brave new world. Great acting, great writing. I wish they'd just released season 2 in one DVD set instead of dividing it up - a money making ploy I guess. Oh well, if it helps pay for more episodes then I won't complain too loudly 
Galactica is for sure one of the best sci-fi series from all times. In this second half of the second season we have the extended version of the fantastic episode "Pegasus" plus "Ressurection Ship" parts 1 and 2 and "The Captains Hand" were we can see the Battlestar Pegasus showing all his guns. It worths every penny 
This show keeps getting better and better. All i can say is that anyone and everyone should watch this show 
There are many great reveiws here- Ditto to the accolades and step by step commentaries. In gestalt, the series is aging like fine balsamic vinegar; multiple layers of concentrated and pungent aromas creating an essense that both satisfies and leaves a desire for more. A heady draught that leaves intermingling aftertastes both strong and pungent yet filled with intricate subtleties. Highly recommended for mature audiences not afraid to examine the viscerality of a dwindling humanity; plunged raw and vulnerably into a hostile environment with primal emotions dissecting credible survivors of near utter global and galactic, holocaust. Do we really deserve to survive? And...they have a plan. Recommended highly for all adults of all genres- no sci-fi interest required 
Disclaimer: I love this show, so my opinion may be biased. This DVD does not disappoint. The first season DVD was great, the Second Season, first half was better, but this one "jumps" light-years ahead of the rest. It contains two episodes "epiphanies" and "downloaded" that were rated by TV guide as the show of the week. This season has the most hardcore episodes such as ressurection ship and the finale is the most shocking yet. What else can be said? Thank the gods for BSG 
Battlestar Galactica is definitely ascribing to the idea of quality over quantity. This half season starts off with an intense cliffhanger and ends with one just as intense. I love shows that can keep the suspense high through the series, with no fluff. I definitely recommend if you are a fan of science fiction in the vein of Babylon 5, Firefly, or Farscape 
After his singing career began to wane, Frank Sinatra began his meteoric rise in the movies. One of his best comedic roles was in the musical Guys and Dolls. But here's another little-seen gem, a Frank Sinatra sleeper that many viewers have caught bits of but which only recently appeared on DVD. After seeing this film, I tried to track it down, not knowing the name of it, and finally found it in Leonard Maltin's film guide (check out his review). They don't make movies like this anymore. That overused cliche is an understatement for this film where everything works, especially the chemistry between Sinatra and Eleanor Parker, but the show stealer is his twelve year old son, Ally, who takes care of the always drinking, always dreaming Sinatra. Edward G. Robinson tries to straighten him out, at bottom still believing in him. If you're wondering if Capra ever made anything as endearing as It's a Wonderful Life, yes he did, and here it is, a great family film now on DVD. 
The films begins with picturesque shots of Miami Florida, circa 1959, that alone could be worth the price of admission. The exterior of the hotel that Sinatra barely owns, is The Cordoza Hotel in South Beach. Sinatra's voice can be heard over the opening credits, singing the Cahn /Van Husen song, "All My Tomorrows". Frank is a single father trying to have all his dreams come true at once, make time with swinging chicks and see that he isn't put out on the street because the mortgage is due on his two star hotel. This was a play adapted for the screen by the playwrite,it feels like the lead character was Jewish, for his parents have the requisite guilt devices, but no matter, all are terrrific. The young man who plays his son, Eddie Hodges, was the little boy from the stage production of, "Music Man" (he was also a big hit on a musical quiz show, Name That Tune-his partner on the show was pilot John Glenn! Now that's trivia of the highest order) Lots of great character actors(Thelma Ritter,Edward G Robinson and Keenan Wynn) and local Florida color and can't forget the charming duet sung by father and son,"High Hopes", adds up to a fun viewing. I watch it every few years, it holds up. Hey, it's a Capra film and he never made a bad movie 
The irony that seems to be lost on everyone in this movie is Sinatra's grand get-rich-quick scheme. He's got this crazy idea about building a Disney Land in Florida. You remember the great scene at the dog track with Keenan Winn where he lays out the plan..."Sure, we pick up the land for a song and we're in business". Keep in mind this is 1959 and even Walt himself probably hadn't thought about picking up all that property dirt cheap and developing the world's largest theme park...Then again maybe Walt saw Hole In The Head 
Sinatra is such a dufus in this movie. He gives up the beautiful, kooky goddess Shirl (Carolyn Jones) just so he can play house with a red-head chick. Besides that disappointment, this is a wonderful film. Not to mention you get a fabulous performance of the song about the ant the rubber tree that just sticks in your head.....years later. A definate must see for any Carolyn Jones fan. My favorite part is when she's out surfing and comes from the water all salty. Two thumbs u 
As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action 
I have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst. I couldn't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on it. They literally stole scenes from Runaway Train in this. Not the ideas, they stole the filmed scenes. The train kept going from one engine to the four in RT. The continuity was a joke. Had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem. Seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up 
I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible. My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end. On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films. Best in Show belongs to a genre of "comedies" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are "Waiting for Guffman", "Bottle Rocket", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie 
This movie combines two things I love in a film: The actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents. This is an improv lover's dream. AND It makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously, in this case, dog shows. Only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog's rating in context. Mainly though, it is just hilarious. Some (okay-a lot) of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately, and nearly too crude for me. Still, it fits the genre. 
Of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, "Best in Show" is definitely the best. The characters and story gel in a perfect comic concoction. "Best in Show" is very different than "Waiting for Guffman" (the first film in the Guest trilogy), although it brings back many of the same actors. While Guffman has a cruel streak in it, "Best in Show" is a little kinder to the characters it skewers -- without losing the laughs. I would skip the third film in the trilogy (A Mighty Wind) unless you are looking for a bittersweet drama. It's just not that funny. If you are Jonesing for a mockumentary fix, search for "G-Sale" -- a quirky comedy very much in the Christopher Guest vein. It got a lot of great reviews and was even labeled "the movie Christopher Guest should have made instead of A Mighty Wind. 
I was not privy to the world of Christopher Guest until a friend of mine told me that if I liked `Drop Dead Gorgeous' then I would flip over any of Guest's films. The video store only had one in, and that was `Best in Show' and I'm SOOOOO glad they had it. This film has to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen, a complete riot from beginning to end. As a true `mockumentary' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to `document' the Mayflower Dog Show. The film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy. There's Jennifer Coolidge and Patrick Crenshaw play Leslie and Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (total spoof on the whole Anna Nicole Smith scandal), owners of a prize winning poodle who's won `Best in Show' 2 years straight, and with the help of lesbian handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) hopefully she'll win for a third. Then there's Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest himself), a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist. And there's power comic couple Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who play the Flecks, owners of a terrier, who struggle with Mrs. Flecks long line of previous lovers. There are lovers Stefan Scott (Michael McKean John Michael Higgins) who spoil their Shih Tzu's and each other. But finally we have the star couple of the show, the neurotic Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey Michael Hitchcock), owners of Beatrice, and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative' Weimaraner who's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex. Their antics, arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film, and their chemistry is pure brilliance. The film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken WAY TO SERIOUS, and with Fred Willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish 
This is one of the most underrated comedies of all-time 
I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows. I'm not, so I couldn't tell you. Mediocre at best. "This is Spinal Tap" was better 
"Best in Show" is another of the very funny improvisational dialog movies that Christopher Guest has directed. The situations are scripted by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, but after that they simply let the actors go where they will with the characters and keep the cameras running. In this movie, he takes aim at dog shows, and the results speak for themselves. The plot of this film is very simple, as the audience is following 5 dogs and their owners and trainers as the go to compete in the Mayflower Dog Show. Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins are hilarious as Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan, the gay owners of Miss Agnes (a Shih Tzu), and Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are equally funny as the preppy "win at all cost" owners (Meg and Hamilton Swan) of Beatrice (a Weimaraner). Christopher Guest plays Harlan Pepper, the outdoorsman owner of Hubert (a Bloodhound), Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are the mismatched couple (Cookie and Gerry Fleck) who own Winky (a Norwich Terrier) where Gerry is a geek, and Cookie seems to have ex-lovers all over the country. Last, but not least, we have Jennifer Coolidge who plays Sheri Ann Ward Cabot the rich owner of the two-time reigning champion Rhapsody in White (a Poodle), and Jane Lynch who plays Christy Cummings the trainer. The other key members of the cast are Fred Willard, who plays Buck Laughlin the know-nothing TV announcer, and Jim Piddock who is Trevor Beckwith, the knowledgeable color man and who plays the straight man for Willard's antics. There are also some wonderful smaller roles, such as Larry Miler as one of Cookie's ex-lovers and Ed Begley Jr. as the hotel manager. Those are just some of the names, but I can't do justice to their wonderful work in such a short review. The actors are the key to improvisation, and the audience is in good hands with this movie. The situations are funny, but the performances are even funnier. "Best in Show" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 8th, 2000. It was not nominated for any Academy Awards, but it did win three American Comedy Awards including: Funniest Motion Picture, Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture (Fred Willard), Funniest Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture (Catherine O'Hara), and Christopher Guest was also nominated for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. The film was also nominated for and won awards from many different groups such as the American Cinema Editors, Boston Society of Film Critics, British Comedy Awards, Canadian Comedy Awards, the Golden Globes and many more. This DVD includes an audio commentary by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy which is somewhat low-key, but there are some very funny moments if you pay close attention. Also available are quite a few deleted scenes. You will also find the features which are almost standard at this point, such as a trailer and cast/filmmaker profiles. In my opinion, this is the best of the improvisational films after "This is Spinal Tap". 
Set in the world of championship dog shows and cast with kooky characters who strive to have their pooch named top dog, BEST IN SHOW is a hilariously funny film that will easily have you laughing out loud. Though there is a scripted premise, most of the dialog in BEST IN SHOW is ad-libbed by comedic greats that include Christopher Guest, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Ed Begley, Jr. to name just a few. The gist of BEST IN SHOW is simple: five dogs whose owners have virtually nothing in common with each other, travel to Philadelphia to enter the Mayflower, a prestigious championship dog show, loosely based on the Westminster event. Beatrice, the emotionless Weimaraner is shown by an uptight yuppie couple (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey) who are nervous wrecks, read the J. Crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru. Rhapsody in White, the highly coiffed Standard Poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire's trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) who is having an affair with Christy Cummings, the dog's severe lesbian trainer (Jane Lynch). Winky, a spunky Norwich Terrier is adored by a former party girl (Catherine O'Hara) and her nerdy, two left footed husband (Eugene Levy) who at every turn is forced to confront his wife's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills. Miss Agnes, the fluffy white Shih Tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men, played brilliantly by Michael McKean and his campy live-in boyfriend (John Michael Higgins). Hubert, the sad-eyed Bloodhound is shown by a single country boy, played by Christopher Guest, who created the series of mock documentary films that BEST IN SHOW is one part of. There are far too many hilarious scenes in BEST IN SHOW to recount. Particularly great ones include the scene when Winky's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as Ed Begley, Jr. Another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator (Fred Willard) reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog's trainers, the judges and the clothing of its owners. But perhaps my favorite scene is when Winky's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths, "they all jump." BEST IN SHOW is a highly recommended DVD from the same mock documentary genre of This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. With star performances by some of the most talented comedians of our time, this movie will have you laughing out loud from start to finish 
Certainly one of the funniest films ever. Great acting and directing. Especially suitable for dog owners, but not limited to them. 
A lot of people have complained about this collection because they claim it doesn't house De Niro's best films. Let me break it down this way: Warner Bros. released this box set (as well as an Al Pacino version) and they are only allowed to include films licensed through WB. Therefore, most Martin Scorsese/De Niro classics such as Raging Bull (MGM), Taxi Driver (Columbia), Casino (Universal) etc. cannot legally be included. They'd have to make some sort of deal with all the major movie studios, and that's practically impossible. So, for what's included here, it's a great place to start a De Niro collection. You can usually find it on the market for $59.99 -- divide it by five... yeah, it's a pretty cheap deal when you consider the fact that these DVDs by themselves cost around $11 - $12 in the average video store. ANALYZE THIS -- Not a great film, but De Niro is very funny and it's an essential De Niro movie as it's not only one of his best comedic performances, but one of his most popular films. If you're a De Niro buff, and you don't own this, you might get some skeptical glances from other fans. WAG THE DOG -- An underrated, sharp satire with a great ensemble cast, well directed by Barry Levinson ("Rain Man"). I can see why some might not like it, but if you enjoyed "Bulworth" and similar political satires, you'll like this. (For the record, I thought it was far subtler and more intellectual than "Bulworth" was, although they're both fine comedies.) Dustin Hoffman is actually better than De Niro in this in my opinion - he's really funny. GOODFELLAS - This has since been released on a Special Edition DVD but this standard-disc version is still good enough... it's got the same transfer as the SE version and the trailers as well... it doesn't have the commentary or the documentaries, but I heard the commentary -- split into different sections -- is a waste of time and the docs are only so-so... at $10 it's a pretty good deal and one of the top five De Niro films of all time. You can always upgrade letter. HEAT -- This has also been re-released recently but nevertheless this disc is pretty good for an older DVD release... the movie itself is awesome. The new DVD is better, but again, you can always upgrade if you enjoy it enough. A BRONX TALE -- Robert De Niro directed this and in my opinion it's one of the greatest gangster/Mafia films ever made, and unique because it deals with different aspects of the genre that even Martin Scorsese doesn't touch upon in some of his films. De Niro is excellent in it and he does a terrific job behind the camera. I'm thrilled to hear he's directing a film next year -- after seeing this I was in awe of just how talented he is behind the camera. So overall if you're new to De Niro this is a good place to start, and if you're building up a collection there's a good chance you're going to want most of these films sooner or later... at a pricetag of $60 it's a pretty good deal and I'd recommend it to anyone. The only other De Niro film I know of that WB had the rights to and should have included here was "Sleepers," also directed by Levinson ("Wag the Dog")... you should seek that out after buying this, it's a good movie 
For such a great actor, I expected to see his best films-not a collection of his so-so films. The movies are good, but it's a huge diappointment to true De Niro fans 
Too good of an actor to not have put his better movies 
I am a very big Robert De Niro fan. This has some of his greatest roles, but I strongly think that they should have replaced the Bronx Tale with Taxi Driver. Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors to ever grace the screen, this collection shows us why 
This is a good first start with excellent films. The fans deserve a wider choice but it's unfair for people to criticize the selection that was released in 1999 for not having films released in 2000 
What about Once upon a time in America, The Untouchables,Cape Fear, Men of Honor, The Godfather, Taxi Driver and 15 Minutes? I would have purchased this collection in a heartbeat if it included his best work. The films in this collection are good, but does not reflect his all of DeNiro's most popular performances (with the exception of Goodfellas). This collection is like qualifying for the olympics. A little taste of what you can do before you collect the gold metal. Analyze This should have been in a comedy pack along with Meet the Parents and Raging Bull. Wag the dog, although ok, should have been left out 
As a Matt Helm fan from 30 years ago this series of 4 movies was "a blast from the past." The gimics, corny jokes and total disregard for "Political Correctness" combined to make excellent viewing. Highly entertaining 
I thought Dean Martin was fantastic as Matt Helm.. I enjoyed all 4 movies immensely.. It was great to travel back to the 60's again.. Elke Sommer, Stella Stevens, Ann Margret, and Senta Berger were super.. What great flicks!!!!! Rich Crow 
for those that love toungue in cheek comedy, than this will suit you. for those that enjoy being entertained with a non social meaning, this is it. dean martin as always leaves the viewer wanting more of his antics. and, as usual he always surrounds himself with a beavy of beautiful women. for entertainment get it 
In the 1960's, there was Bond, James Bond. Then there was the Man from U.N.C.L.E, Wild Wild West and Our Man Flint...and the biggest Poke in the eye to Bond, Matt Helm. Dean Martin did four Matt Helm films. These films were all tongue and cheek, all done for laughes..always poking the spy genre in the eye. These four films in this collection have action with so much comedy twists. If you want humor with a 60's bent, this is it. Martin slick Helm is fun to watch. He essays the Helm role with a girl in his bed, a martini and satire humor (One film the girl is listening to Frank Sinatra-Martin deadpans "You like Perry Como?"). These are cute thrillers will no real substance, but you dont go to an Austin Powers movies for a real mystery either. This is spy fluff that is funny and filling. Worth ten stars, but they only allow me five Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD 
Apparently there is more than one version of this set on the market. One may be the unedited, widescreen Sony/Columbia Pictures version from Amazon. This is the one to get. From the unjustified negative comments of some reviewers, it seems that a second or bootleg version is also available. The second verison can be distinguished from the Sony version by the fact that the movies are displayed in a full-screen format, the discs are a poor quality, and the movies have been edited for broadcast TV channels. Why buy this set? Well, you might smile when you see some of the outfits from the '70s, the dancing, and the charms of Ann-Margaret, Stella Stevens, Sharon Tate, Elke Sommer, Nancy Kwan, Janice Rule, Senta Berger, and others. It's obvious that Dean Martin was very lucky and he knew it. It looks like everyone had a good time 
ALL of these discs are such poor quality that they continually freeze in any DVD player. No wonder they're so cheap, you get what you pay for 
It's great that the studio's is finally putting out a Matt Helm box set at a really great price compared to the more expensive separate versions.Any fan of 60's spy movies will love this set.Dean Martin's tongue is firmly in his cheek, and the women ,Tina Louise,Sharon Tate,Ann Margret,and many many more,what more can I say.Highly recommended! 
The Mat Helm movies are pretty funny, and of course the girls are pretty - but I imagine the folks from MADD would be horrified to see how much they play up the "Dean as a boozer" angle while he's driving. As someone else mentioned, the Station Wagon spy car has a hidden bar with several bottles so Dean doesn't need to worry about running out of ammunition. The joke they missed was calling the hidden bottles of booze his "seat belts". In another movie he's got a more sporty car, and in a chase scene you see one of that cars unique gadgets - he picks up a microphone and says "If you can read this, you're too close" and the message scrolls across the tail lights... I do see where these movies were an inspiration for the Austin Powers series. My guess is these movies will be appreciated most by folks who remember Dean Martin, and I think they wouldn't be a bad choice for kids because while there's some suggestive stuff, it's tame by todays standards - though obviously the "don't drink and drive" message should be discussed. 
This set is a must-have for all Dean Martin fans! I really enjoy the fact that the Matt Helm character never takes himself too seriously. He plays it for what it is - sheer fun! Great looking babes, groovy outfits, and just-right scripting and acting make this set as smooth as silk! Dean always looks like he just had a cocktail in every scene! Sure, the critics will always make the 007 comparisons. However, I happen to enjoy both Matt Helm and James Bond movies equally, and the "Flint" (James Coburn) installment of films as well! 
Robert S. McNamara is the consumate 20th century man. He is truly representative of his time. The interesting little homilies that he claims he has gleaned from his expereinces are universal and true. McNamara displays all the qualities that made him the most effective Secretary of Defense in the 20th century: articulate, thoughtful, a natural debater and very, very smart. Despite all the issues, McNamara says only what he want to, even stating that he never, never answers a question asked of him. Overall, this is an excellent documentary, it should be standard viewing for any American History course covering this period 
Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara is the focus of Errol Morris's award winning, engaging documentary "The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara." The film's up-close and personal approach to its subject offers an interesting and chilling look at America's foreign policy during the years 1961-1968 when McNamara served as the Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson. The film also traces McNamara's pre-Washington, WWII career as an officer in the Army Air Force's Office of Statistical Control. Here he analyzed and improved the efficiency of U.S. bombing missions. While ostensibly analyzing McNamara's 11 Lessons of War, the film also examines the underlying moral questions surrounding war--is war justified? Is it avoidable? And--in hindsight--is it worth the cost? McNamara frankly admits "any military commander ... has made mistakes", and on camera McNamara discusses three main points in American 20th Century foreign policy--the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and of course, the Vietnam War. While McNamara was not involved in the decision to drop nuclear weapons, he states that this was unnecessary and "not proportional." He discusses his role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, claiming that he knew nothing at the time about America's attempts to assassinate Castro. The Cuban Missile Crisis serves as a good example, however, of Lesson 1: "Empathize with your enemy." McNamara argues that it took Tommy Thompson understanding Khrushchev to decide how to respond to the Soviets. When it comes to Vietnam, however, McNamara is much less of an apologist and much more slippery. In hindsight, it's easy to see the Vietnam War as totally unnecessary, but McNamara argues that the Vietnam War was an intrinsic part of the Cold War. At the time, 'saving' Vietnam from the communists was an imperative, but now, of course, that just seems nonsensical. But ideology aside, chilling pivotal archival footage of conversations between McNamara and Kennedy--and later Johnson--reveal that these men knew full well that Vietnam was a hopeless war, and yet they all sent men as fodder to the war machine for years. McNamara had misgivings about the war very early on and privately stated his dire reservations while publicly describing it as a "battle to win the hearts and minds of the people." These diametrically opposed opinions--private and public--illustrate the moral dissonance of those puppet masters who directed the Vietnam War "on tyranny and aggression." No doubt if politicians were required to fight these wars, they'd create swift, diplomatic conclusions. The interviewer is remarkably soft with McNamara, and when tough questions are asked, McNamara illustrates his inherent nature as a politician. Lesson 9: "In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil" offers marvelous opportunities for the ethical examination of war situations. McNamara jocularly explains a rule he lives by: "never answer the question asked of you. Answer the question you wish you'd been asked." McNamara illustrates his point by failing to address questions regarding the moral consequences of his actions, and even manages to speak of himself in the third person at a crucial moment. Still, in spite of McNamara's evasiveness, the documentary offers a unique opportunity to interview one of the architects of the Vietnam War decades after the fact, and asks: "what were you thinking?" The viewer will draw conclusions from both those questions answered and those questions studiously avoided--displacedhuma 
This documentary blew my mind so much that my husband and I watched it more than once- something we NEVER do. I liked it so myuch I sent it to my father and mother who had definate opinions of McNamara and the war and this completely changed the way they saw everything. My father is a war veteran and a buff of this kind of thing and even he learned a lot from it. Fantastic movie. Must see 
One of the "lessons" that Robert McNamara imparts in this documentary is that "in order to do good, you may have to engage in evil." This lesson essentially sums up the life of not only McNamara but the history of the United States in the later half of the 20th century. However, the question that the film really presents is just how much evil must one do to accomplish good. In the final estimation, did McNamara do more good then evil? Morris does not answer this, but makes it clear that this ultimate question cannot be answered by simply plugging in numbers to an IBM machine. One could be tempted to think that for every Japanese life lost in the fire bombings in 1945, maybe 10 American lives were sparred from a land invasion of the home islands. Was that worth it? For the 68,000 lives lost in Vietnam, did McNamara make this up in his leadership of the World Bank? There is not an answer to this question, and even the subject of this documentary cannot attempt to answer it without contradicting himself. At one point in the interview McNamara believes that he was acting as part of a machine, but later on adds that he was acting as a war criminal during the bombing of Japan. Does mankind abdicate his free will when the fog of war rolls in? This is what makes this documentary so compelling is that it shows a 83 year old coming to grips with the reality of what he has done, and what he has not done. One could think that a viewer would have come away from this documentary with an understandable loathing for Robert McNamara. After all, he would be the prototypical target of such protest songs as Dylan's "Masters of War" or the poster-child of the military-industrial complex. Yet, each time I watch the movie, I do not feel anger towards him, but I feel rather a partial remoteness that is hard to explain. Part of the explanation is that if placed in the same situation, I know that I would have acted the same way. I too would have followed orders from Curtis LeMay concerning the bombing of Japan. I also would have probably ran Vietnam with the same attitude that McNamara did. Now that we have seen that the lessons from Vietnam were not read when it came to Iraq, one could only think of what George Bernard Shaw once wrote:"We learn from history that we learn nothing from history." "The Fog of War" is not a dry historical documentary, but rather a primer on philosophy, rationality and ultimately death. 
Last night, I watched the documentary, Fog of War, about former Secretary of Defense, Robert S. MacNamara, the Harvard-educated whiz kid who many call the architect of the Vietnam War. It is the portrait of a brilliant, but profoundly troubled old man who weeps about selecting a plot of ground in Arlington in which to bury JFK, but is steel-eyed as he recounts bombing sorties that destroy hundreds of thousands. While fighting hard to stay composed, it is evident that MacNamara is haunted by his own dark deeds and the human condition but remains stubbornly out of touch with the part of himself that orchestrated them. The experiences he recounts - most notably, in WWII, devising ways for U.S. bomb to destroy most of Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians a day to presiding over the Dept of Defense for eight years of the U.S. in Vietnam - are stunning in his application of sophisticated management techniques and statistics to destroy lives and nations. Were he not on the side of good, he observes at one point, he would surely be tried as a war criminal, to which I would add, on a scale equal to Hitler. MacNamara is a very bright man and the film is well done, even if the interviewer couldn't quite decide whether to be in it or not, and therefore doesn't use a microphone for his own questions. It's also a very valuable instructive tool - recounting in chilling detail how close we came to nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crises, the Cold War, World War II and finally Vietnam. It is also heavily edited, I would imagine so that MacNamara could be firmly in charge, pulling back and stepping forward as suits him. It is therefore filled with omissions and lies - the willingness of the U.S. to go to war to protect its economic interests and the fabrication at Johnson's insistence of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, a perfect analog to the trumped up intelligence Bush used to justify invading Iraq. Although it is about history and the role of a man who dedicated much of his professional life to efficiently killing people (in the name of ideals and for our leaders, he would hasten to add, sounding very similar to generals in the Third Reich), the film is especially chilling as it lays out Eleven Lessons for our nation, several of which we are flagrantly violating today in Iraq; namely, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 11. In fact, the parallels between the folly of believing we could win the war in Indochina and our present situation in what was formerly Persia are so profound, it's a wonder there aren't more documentaries, novels, essays and intelligent discourse on the subject. (Read Graham Greene's The Quiet American, written in the late 50s, and the folly of our efforts in Vietnam is plain enough for an 8th grader to get). 1. Empathize with your enemy. 2. Rationality will not save us. 3. There's something beyond one's self. 4. Maximize efficiency. 5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war. 6. Get the data. 7. Belief and seeing are both often wrong. 8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning. 9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil. 10. Never say never. 11. You can't change human nature. What's even sadder is that as many mistakes and as much damage as MacNamara committed, he is head and shoulders above Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush administration. That George W. Bush is out of the class of statesman is so obvious, I won't waste time describing how poorly he fares next to JFK, Kruschev and even fellow Texas cowboy, Lyndon B. Johnson. Fog of War is an excellent film. In MacNamara, Shakespeare would feel vindicated for creating some of his darkest characters. Pure evil does exist. It is, in its most extreme, as Hannah Arendt alleged after WWII, banal. 
the oscar winning documentary studies the career of robert strange mcnamara, savior of ford motor company, architect of the viet nam war, patron saint of the golbalization economy, self-justifier par excellence, and (imho) one of the greatest villains of the 20th century. (ok, hes not on a level with stalin or hitler or walter o'malley, but hes close). the film manages to remain even handed about its subject, something i would never be able to do, and on that level it should be appreciated. i think his fans will come away seeing him as a tragically flawed hero, and his detractors (like me) will come away seeing him as the vile [...] he is. the movie demands that you think, and for that alone it should be seen by any person interested in americas role in the world. 
A great behind-the-scenes look at decisions that shaped history - and nearly killed all of us. Cross-reference this with the more recent Kennedy biographies for a wider, sobering context. This is the sort of thing that the Bush Administration should have watched before deciding to invade Iraq. 
I lived through the vietnam era. IF you did you can't ever forget. This guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us. Here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong, why it went wrong and what we can learn to KEEP FROM REPEATING IT. For me, here was the most unforgettable moment. Decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days. Macnamara tells him we--the americans--were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism, seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china. The north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said, "Mr. Macnamara, you must have never read a history book! We've been FIGHTING the chinese for a thousand years! We aren't their puppet! We were fighting for our national freedom! We would have fought to the last man!" Macnamara says they almost came to blows. Here's the point. Macnamara says, as compared to say the soviets, we didn't understand the north vietnamese. We didn't really know enought about them. We had no idea what was in their minds. And that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons! That's why we lost! Does any of this sound familiar?????? This is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age. It's that good and that informative. Of course, it won't be widely viewed by the american public. We'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things--like sporting events 
This reveals a great deal about Vietnam and the 1960's. Should be prized by students of Kennedy, Johnson, and our military history in the nuclear age 
My first glimpse of Errol Morris' work (The Thin Blue Line) was for an undergraduate history seminar examining the role (and subsequent fallacy) of human memory in historical discourse. While "The Thin Blue Line" examined a singular Texas murder, Morris' "Fog of War" has a larger footprint since it probes an extremely sharp and cognizant 80+ year old McNamara and his position in United States war policy over a thirty year span. World War II and Vietnam obviously provide a lot of ground to cover in a documentary, but the "larger footprint" of Morris' film rests with the controversial nature of McNamara in the public's mind versus the historical record. In short, McNamara bears some responsibility (and perhaps lingering guilt) for his recommendations in the WWII bombing and the Vietnam policy. The Vietnam War was not his action alone, however; he was part of a national security apparatus submitting recommendations to the only man who could act: The President of the United States. Accordingly, McNamara bears partial responsibility but he is well aware of a popular desire for his complete contrition. Yet, he now bears the sole burden for these group actions because he was the face of the Vietnam policy for two presidents and he is one of the few presidential advisors still alive from the Kennedy/Johnson Era (as well as the WWII bombing decisions). McNamara is certainly aware of his position as well as the fact that certain portions of the American public want a criminal confession from the man. With that "public pitfall" in mind, McNamara's explanations and answers to Morris' questions can appear scheming and duplicitous, but those answers simply place decisions and policy in their proper historical framework. At one point in the film, Morris' essentially asks McNamara who was responsible for Vietnam decisions and McNamara quickly replies, "The President". The audience (or at least, I) wanted McNamara to answer, "It was my decision" and - as such - may view the President Response as a cop-out. However, McNamara is absolutely correct; the decision for action rested with the Commander-in-Chief and his name was never Robert Strange McNamara. From the audience's perspective, it is nothing short of compelling to watch a man justify unpopular actions while dodging an undue burden of responsibility and respecting (i.e., not damning) the two presidents he served and loved. Personally, I relished the personal insights Morris captured (or that McNamara permitted himself to show?). These poignant glimpses ranged from McNamara's tearful story of surveying Arlington National Cemetery for Kennedy's eventual burial plot to the fleeting family health references confronting the McNamara Family during the Secretary of Defense years. My favorite insight into McNamara's soul comes during the retelling of the young Quaker who set himself on fire below McNamara's office mere moments after handing his baby daughter to a pleading bystander. While the story is well known, McNamara pays respect to the widow's subsequent explanation and appears to have kept tabs on the daughter. I am still not sure what to make of that insight and dozens of others, but those personal glimpses are the underlying force of the film. In terms of filmmaking, some reviews have blasted Morris' technique of being off camera and unmiked, his use of the Glass soundtrack, or his reliance on public domain stock footage of planes, bombing, or protests. In many respects, they are right: either you love Morris' methods or they will grate on you. The editing cuts can be choppy, but it is unclear how much of that is for dramatic effect or if the original interviews went back and forth over the same material. If you enjoy a bombastic Michael Moore-type figure guiding the audience through a series of contrived events peppered with sarcastic and puerile rhetoric, then "The Fog of War" may not be the documentary for you and worth a local rental. On the other hand, if you enjoyed Morris' earlier "The Thin Blue Line" or Barbara Kopple's "Harlan County, USA" and "American Dream", then you will want to buy this DVD for the theatrical release, deleted scenes, and McNamara's own rules. 
Ninety percent opinion, ten percent fact. For more in-depth analysis and much harder hitting investigation based on mainstream media reporting view any of Alex Jones' later films. 9/11: The Road to Tyranny, Martial Law: Rise of the Police State, and TerrorStorm are far better. Heck, you can view them all for free on Google and YouTube. Alex is a man so concerned with getting the word out that he releases all his works for free HIMSELF 
of course, 20/20 hindsight is always nice in cases like this, but, i was a huge supporter of this film when it was still 'against the country' to do so...i reviewed it back then for 'another' publication, and, of course, as we know, many people lost their jobs over such a 'treasonous act'...(fortunately, i was not one of them...)... but time has revealed to (almost) all that the bush administration lied from the get-go and has been lying ever since... and contrary to one or two stragglers who still think bush won florida...KNOCK IT OFF!!!!!!...when the 'so-called' recount was done, it never took into account all the 'illegal' butterfly ballots that had candidates names on both sides of the ballot (which is againast florida state law), causing many to vote for pat buchanan by accident...(no to mention the disinfranchised democrats who weren't allowed to vote due to republican strong-arming...) and, the sad fact that, by now, that i would still have to tell anyone left in america about the wicked ways of this administration, just goes to prove that some, no matter how much truth is placed before them, will still ignore common sense and follow the path that leads to their own destruction... next time, this country better not wait for the 'bell curve' to catch up with those who already know.. 
I counted ~15 factual errors (aka lies) during Michael Moore's opening speech.* I stopped shortly after. I'm not going to waste my time on such obviously factually-wrong fiction. How stupid does Mr. Moore think we are? I was *there* watching the election unfold, and what he reported is NOT what happened. * Example: He said FOX News pressured NBC, cbs, abc, and cnn to change their minds, and give Florida to Gore, and then Bush. What a load of lies. FOX news has no power over the other nets. NBC, cbs, abc, cnn operate independently, and reached their decisions independently, without influence from Fox. * And furthermore, the other nets did NOT call for bush (as Moore falsely claimed). They labeled Florida "undecided", and left it that way for several days. * Also, Moore claimed that a recount showed Gore won Florida. FALSE. A bipartisan committee counted the votes a few months later, and not only did Bush win, but the recount *increased* his lead from a few hundred to several thousand, because of conservative communities in western Florida. (Many other non-biased groups found the same result.) This video reminds me of his Columbine documentary, where men's ties kept changing colors in the middle of their speeches (it's called creative editing). Moore has no ethics. Propagandist. As far as I'm concerned, he's no better than a KKK member. Same mental disorder illogic. 
First, I give this 5 stars because of the subject matter and the subject matter's importance, AND the supplemental interviews and DVD extras; but not for the quality of the documentary filmmaking. More about that in a moment... The subject matter is very, very, deadly serious. Easily the most important subject matter of this decade and certainly one of the top issues of the last 40 years. Regardless of whether you consider yourself in one political camp or another, or neutral; you should know that the documentary looks at both individual, very personal concerns such as a mother who lost her son in the war, and also examines much broader, political and economic aspects and questions that deserve attention, and intelligent, calm discussion. **** Even if you have seen the film and disagree, you should WATCH THE DVD SUPPLEMENTAL footage. If you miss these additional parts, you are missing 50% of the information. Please see #2 below And if you are critical of the main documentary's viewpoint, you may welcome the fact that the supplemental material is largely unedited, running footage devoid of any particular viewpoint from the film's authors. This documentary well deserves the praise for being one of the first to approach this subject at a time when virtually the entire Western world media would not (or could not) go near this topic. When national fever is high and any questioning of the war effort is considered "treason," "unpatriotic," and "morally wrong;" our constitutional rights such as free speech and free assembly are in serious danger. The documentary portrays this, but (unfortunately) only in a sidelight fashion (one of many problems). In fact, I'm not sure the filmmakers realized this was one of the greatest overriding issues. If common citizens were better informed, the insane actions and atrocities would have never happened. Yet, the documentary displays this serious, national problem of the absentee press graphically and without any possible misinterpretation. Both within the US and in other parts of the world, censorship and denial is taking place. But it doesn't make the points strongly or clearly enough. Because this film and its issues have been seen now by tens of millions, it is part of our culture and that effect is growing. To dismiss it without seeing it in its entirety (plus the supplemental materials!) is going to cast doubt on anyone who tries to discuss the documentary but doesn't know firsthand how the information is presented. Basically, you can't attack the documentary's ideas unless you watch the documentary. Hearing about it from your uncle or coworker will not be an acceptable working knowledge. Furthermore, since these are gigantic political and life-threatening issues, every citizen has a duty to be as informed as possible. We can't have a country that goes to war, invades another 2 other countries, kills and permanently maims tens of thousands of its own soldiers and tens of thousands of citizens in the other countries, puts another 20,000+ in jail for six+ years, commits acts of torture by the thousands, and then has a substantial part of its own population refuse to consider this as right or wrong, and refuses to spend 2 hours of their time watching a easily available documentary that might shed new light or viewpoints on this situation. That being said, Michael Moore's and his filmmaking team's documentary skills and decisions are sometimes good, but other times quite poor. This documentary has several problems, and these have nothing to do with facts being correct or other content issues; this is strictly about the documentary filmmaking *process* and the decisions made in the creation of this work. -- Big Problem #1: If you have a film titled "Fahrenheit 9/11", don't start the film discussing presidential election questions and/or irregularities. Any filmmaker knows that every minute, and every second, of their footage is precious, especially the first 10 minutes. A documentary on our nationwide election problems is just fine. But that's another documentary; maybe a really good one, but I don't think it should have been included, except perhaps at the end. By starting off with material not directly related to the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Moore has given his critics ample fodder for criticism and rejection in the beginning, even if the reason for that rejection has flaws. This decision was a huge presentation blunder, and stole precious resources that could have been used to set up and structure the rest of the material, and prepare the audience for what was ahead. In its final form, this information is irrelevant to the next 90 minutes and barely remembered after it's all over. -- Big Problem #2: As mentioned above, the filmmakers did not appear to have a good grasp of the subjects they were documenting, and there's no strong sense of what is important and what's not. The results are missed opportunities, a barrage of information, and a lack of clarity. The information is not well organized, and it's not summarized or reviewed at times when a new viewer needs time to catch their breath. This is a problem with editing and pacing; and understanding how a viewer or audience will mentally keep track of everything. That doesn't mean the material is incorrect or faulty, it means it's assembled and presented poorly. As a comparison, I'd say it was like reading a book by starting with the last chapter, then backing up one chapter at a time. Sure, you read the book and all the words, but the people, information, story, and connections are going to be a lot harder to put together with that kind of approach. We see a lot of really important information. There's no doubt about that. But what are the most important points? You might name 3, but someone else might name 3 completely different ones. And both would be right! However, this shouldn't happen if the documentary is well made. -- Big Problem #3: The film doesn't possess a good structure. It's not a particularly linear piece, neither does it follow several simultaneous information or storylines. It doesn't have a "scientific" approach or any other good format. Instead it's an assembly line of data but fails to add up to a finished product, and following this analogy, some information falls off the assembly line and is easily forgotten. Again, this doesn't mean the data is wrong, this is a mistake of filmmaking; and in all fairness, it's the sort of mistake one would expect from someone not well skilled at creating documentaries. It's not amateur, but it's not tight and coherent either. The material is both dense emotionally explosive, and hard to digest, especially if you aren't familiar with all the facts. But the presentation doesn't work to help the viewer through this, and connect the many pieces of information or give time for pause and review. Instead, the presentation is relentless and has a zigzag structure which takes away from the power of the material rather than combine it to something stronger. For instance, we see critically important censorship and denial on the part of the media, but it's not brought into sharp mental focus amongst all the other information and data, and neither are the implications of this media black hole. This needed stronger, more focused presentation. The great crime that a war for "freedom" has denied "freedom of the press" is very likely lost to many viewers. Add to this a seemingly never-ending series of musical jokes and segments, which I can't even guess at their purpose. Here we are watching this [literally] deadly serious material, and suddenly we have silly rock music and images, like some low-grade music video. This type of decision is truly amateur and pathetic; and just as shameful as the people being being joked about. If the documentary filmmakers don't treat the subject with seriousness, how can they ridicule other people? But this documentary shouldn't have jokes. In fact, no "true documentary" would ever take this lunatic approach, and this behavior easily opens up the entire subject to ridicule. It's incomprehensible how any documentary would be created with this type of approach. Shame on the producers, distributors, and anyone else involved with the production for not stepping forward and "telling the emperor he has no clothes." This juvenile, dimwit approach disgraces the production and insults everyone who has suffered from the craziness of "Fahrenheit 9/11". This should never have happened. -- Big Problem #4: Every moment of the film should be about runaway crazy "Fahrenheit 9/11," but it isn't. As an example, President Bush bangs the podium and exclaims the usual nonsense about terrorists hating freedom and hating American goodwill. So why not show the real reasons? Like the fact that the United States sold arms to Iran and Iraq as they fought each other years ago, creating immense hostility throughout the Middle East towards the US? A little information, to either remind or inform the viewer of the real reasons for the hatred goes a long way to proving how we received an endless stream of lies and misleading information about the entire situation. Better yet, since you are doing a documentary, why not ask a variety of experts on the subject, and have them explain and agree or disagree with "terrorists hate America and freedom". Instead, precious moments in the documentary are stolen with largely dead or irrelevant material, such as when Michael Moore stands outside the Saudi Embassy with Secret Service coming to ask questions. It's interesting, but belongs in the supplemental materials section. That is not something that qualifies as national hysteria or "Fahrenheit 9/11". And it opens both Michael Moore and his entire team to criticisms of grandstanding and trying to be performers and part of the story instead of good documentary filmmakers. Here's one of the most important things you should know: In the original film documentary, we see a US military raid on a civilian home suspected to harbor terrorists To my utter dismay, we see in the supplemental materials this is part of a much larger story with 10 times as much impact, with disgusting, barbaric and outrageous disrespect for ordinary citizens by our soldiers. Unfortunately this is lost and jumbled in the original cut. The Swedish reporter with the US military unit tells us that no one, including Swedish media, would present this shocking and horrifying behavior. Furthermore, only the supplemental material lets us have an idea of the type of documentary footage Michael Moore and his team had to work with. In this well-documented sequence from the Swedish journalists, we see one of our military units invade an ordinary family's home and our soldiers physically and mentally abusing and terrorizing ordinary citizens, including tormenting a crippled old man. Apparently they didn't understand its importance. THEN! ... we find out that one of the soldiers was drunk, and soldiers hit the old man's penis repeatedly, and this all happens with the commanding officer watching calmly to the side. Why on earth wasn't this included in the main documentary? This isn't as bad as Abu Ghraib torture sessions, but it's dynamite material nevertheless. And then we are told this is not anything unusual; in fact it's commonplace! Showing our military behaving like this is extremely important footage, and shows why people in Iraq and the Middle Eastern world have learned to hate the United States more and more each year. Yet, this crucial segment is poorly presented and largely lost in the original documentary. Compared to some of the segments mentioned above, this is clearly more important. But, it was cast aside. I cannot understand this. It's hard to speculate, but if this was left out, we have to ask ourselves what other material has been discarded? This is, unfortunately, just plain bad decision-making in the documentary process, a real lack of comprehension about on the part of the documentary filmmakers; and poor workmanship compared to other documentary work. -- Final thoughts: At this point you may think my opinion of the documentary is poor and maybe not worth viewing, so let me avoid the film's mistake and summarize this: This is an exceedingly serious and important documentary, and I recommend it along with the supplemental materials to anyone who considers himself a good American, of moral conscience, or anyone who has interest in American politics and actions. You don't have to agree but you should be familiar with the material and see all of it. That's why it gets 5 stars. You need to watch this. However, I'm very critical of the documentary skill, or lack thereof, and a much better and threfore less controversial documentary could have been created from the same materials, and might have had a more positive impact and received wider acceptance. Even so, this needs to be seen. And if you are confused how I can give five stars to something with this many problems, let me repeat that just delving into this subject in the national, political environment of the time of its release was breakthrough and revolutionary. It would have been "great" in the hands of others 
Fahrenheit 9/11 just blew my mind when I saw it. It gives a complete new perspective on the politics of the US and on Bush's administration. The film's objectivity is not to be questioned, cause Michael Moore gives clear evidence on everything. This movie really shows what America is like in this new era and how innocent people die for its welfare. I am amazed that this film was actually released for the open public and that the author wasn't hanged on the street. I wouldn't be surprised if that happened 
Out of 5 stars, I give it a 10. If you haven't seen it, you're missing the past two decades. The information is right on the Money, in more ways than one 
Film footage was really important. I did not know that Bush had his car egged when he was inagurated the 1st time. I did not know that he was the 1st president not able to walk his last leg to the inaguration because of protests. I did not know because the bush administation had the media supressed at that time. I thought this movie was really important because it got out info for the 1st time that we could not see before. I would take a look at it and you can see things you did not see and know some things that you did not know. See for yourself. It is a rental now 
The bedlams that greet the current Republican Administration each morning for USA `involvement in Iraq' have actually relegated this DVD to second-rate. It is obvious that the producers of this so called `Documentary' are more likely to be fractious to Mr. Bush in particular than accommodating to the American public at large. It is also obvious that Mr Bush is not the type of person to succumb to self-pity. Mr Moore must be happier receiving ready cash from the other camp though. In the meantime I can still see very long queues moving slowly waiting for the full truth behind 9/11 to unfold. 
I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc. That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO? Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
Boring! All this time is spent during the DVD talking about the John Fisher technique, but not really showing you anything specific. Lots of great video shots of dogs romping about with their owners and shots of classes being conducted, all being voiced over about the 'great john fisher technique'. Who cares! I didn't order the video so that I could go look for a trainer who trains with this technique, I ordered it so that I could train my own dog. So little instructional information was given and the video was so boring, me and my dogs fell asleep watching it. What a waste 
It's a great resource, covering selecting a breed of dog, tips related to training, and information related to dog behavior. It shows footage of dogs in different situations and a little of John Fisher but the narrator often talked over him. The final chapter, chapter 8, was an interesting recital of a personal experience John Fisher had with a challenging dog and how he handled it. This DVD is an overview and not heavily focused on oral commands 
I enjoyed each of the Friday series. I reviewed the original way back, and now after re-watching Next Friday, I thought I'd finally get around to reviewing this. I still think I enjoyed Friday the best, but this is a good follow up. Ice Cube returns as Craig Jones who has a knack for getting into trouble. He goes to stay with family out in Rancho Cucamonga. They've just won the lottery and have this whole new place. While Chris Tucker isn't in here this time, we still get the hilarious John Witherspoon. He's fantastic. I only give this four stars because it goes a little flat during the second half, but it's still good overall. The cousin Day-Day is probably the funniest, but if you are a fan of the original, then you have got to see this. I loved it 
...but a decent sequel. (But hey? It's not often that the sequel is better than the prequel.) I was mad because alot of questions were not answered and the plot was not all that good. I wanted Craig (Ice Cube) to hook up with that girl next door. All she does is have a short convo with her and at the end she blows a kiss and thats the end. I believe thats pointless for Craig's Pops (Jon Witherspoon)drops him off in Rancho Cucamonga (I don't think I spelled it right) then turns around and picks him up. Its a funny movie, but not as good as the first though 
I thought Next Friday was way better than the original....... The first movie was really slow in the beginning.......so slow that I fell asleep. As soon as you pop this movie in, you'll be laughing from beginning to end........ Mike Epps is hilarious as Day-Day, Craigs cousin, and Craigs father has some pretty funny lines in this one........ Rent it, you won't be sorry...... 
Like most people, I loved the original Friday - a true classic. I had heard that this one wasn't as good, so I rented a copy just to check it out for myself. This movie is straight-up garbage. Mike Epps can't carry Chris Tucker's jock. What a waste of what could have been a very good movie series. Stick with the original; don't waste your time or money on this one 
next friday was so much better than the first one. with much more funnier scenes. and this movie is reccommended for everyone 
I enjoyed Ice Cube in this movie, but I think Day-day and uncle Elroy could have been funnier, Debo was the best part along with the new character sticky fingaz but wtf happened to Debo 
I grew up reading the Eloise books and always loved them. We read those stories over and over and thought that Eloise and all of her antics were hillarious to the point that my sister and I wanted to BE Eloise. However, when my sister purchased this movie for my 3 year old daughter I was a little concerned. Though I love the Eloise stories, I didn't necessarily think that Eloise was the best role model for my impressionable young daughter. However, to my very happy surprise, Disney has managed to present an adorable, sweet, caring version of the little girl from the books, while still staying true to so many of her little quirks and mischief that make her so lovable and entertaining. This movie is very well acted all around, especially by the Eloise and Nanny (Julie Andrews) characters, both of whom have a warmth and sweetness not evident in the book that only adds to movie version and makes it much more appropriate for kids. Purists of the book that are looking for pure sass and troublemaking in Eloise may thinik the movie too soft, but it is a perfect interpretation for family viewing. This is a great movie that can be enjoyed not only at Christmas, but throughout the year 
I can't say that I toatlly enjoyed the first Eloise made for T.V. movie by Disney but, my youngest cousin wanted to give this a go for family movie night around the holidays. I watch it and was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it. Little Eloise is done wonderfully by Sophia who plays the michviously little girl who just loves Christmas at the plaza. Eloise manages to change lives close to Christmas day having old friends re-connect as lovers and rescue a friend from a doomed marriage or help a grieving mother manage to stay at her home. Not to mention getting into plenty of trouble and buying heaps of presents. Eloise all in all has the life every little girl wants to have. I found myself dreaming about being at the Plaza at Christmastime myself. My little cousin loved the movie and I enjoyed it myself. It's a perfect movie to add to your Christmas collection or just to watch with your kids. Right now, we're watching it in Febuary!!! It's a great treasure and I can only hope this isn't the last in the Eloise series 
Unlike the curmudgeon above, I enjoyed this movie because I took it as it was intended, a children's movie. I have a 6 year old daughter who is exposed incessantly to appeals to the lowest common denominator in the form of twisted concepts of human sexualtiy, myopic schooling, and rank commercialism, amongst others. I am attempting with everything in me to rear a daughter with self confidence, intelligence, and above all the will to express herself in the face of adversity.  While I have substantial concern with the setting of Eloise, the underlying themes of the film I believe supercede the lifestyle of privlege portrayed. These themes are independence of thought, self confidence, innocence as a power for good, and the triumph of the free thinker over social castes.  It is indeed pablum, but pablum is extremely beneficial in it's context.  This film is light hearted, amusing, shallow, and utterly enchanting for the young at heart, including reluctant adults. Disney has it's place, and should not be rearing our children, but for a parent with interest in their child's upbringing, able to reinforce the beneficial aspects of the film, this quintessentially Disney movie is entirely pleasant. Peace, Someone's Daddy 
I've always loved Kay Thompson's brilliant "Eloise" books. Eloise was born 3 years before me, although she benefits from a case of arrested development (not unlike Dennis the Menace), having reached the age of 6 in 1955 and never aging since. I've been to the Plaza Hotel as a child in the late '50s and early '60s, and my mother spent many happy years in the Big Apple, some as a Barbizon resident. My grandmother once remarked to my mother that the oil portrait of Eloise in the Plaza lobby made her think "She must be the manager's daughter," since no other explanation could account for such an "ugly child" being so prominently displayed! Kay Thompson was a graduate of the same high school in St. Louis as my mother, and went on to achieve many wonderful, gutsy, triumphs in Hollywood as a dancer, choreographer, designer, and actress (including her role in "Funny Face" with Fred Astaire and Audrey Hebburn as the Vogue-ish magazine editor who advocated "Think pink!"). I greatly admire the multi-talented and mercurial Thompson and her inspired illustrator, Hilary Knight who did as much as Thompson to bring Eloise to life. For that matter, I very much like Eloise herself, who was by all accounts Kay Thompson's alter-ego. The first Eloise book was subtitled "A book for precocious grownups, about a little girl who lives at the Plaza Hotel." Eloise was a child, but the books were not meant for children. Adults, especially those who've raised children of their own, understand that children are not Better, Wiser, Smarter, and Kinder than adults. But since at least "Pollyanna" if not before, Disney Studios has been churning out a constant stream of propaganda films asserting just the opoosite. And now, Kay Thompson's wonderful playful, innocent, bratty, obnoxious, sweet Eloise has been beatified by Disney as their latest Child Sage. The problem with these lies (and all others) is that they blind people of all ages to their own shortcomings while unfairly blaming them on others. Children are not wiser and better than adults, and they never have been, and they never will be, even if Jimmy Carter did think his 11-year-old daughter Amy had the last word to say about nuclear weapons (he was mistaken, of course). Children are typically much more cruel than adults, and if they say sweet innocent things from time to time (which is rare) it is only because they haven't lived long enough to learn better. But they will learn better eventually; although some of them will suppress or deny their life-lessons to become seriously committed adult hypocrites. Adults who don't get this either don't have children, or don't pay attention to them as they really are, Disney Studios' party line notwithstanding. In the books, Eloise's charm lay in her vulnerabiltity, her precociousness, her smart-aleck attitude, and her essential warmth, which asked no quarter and took no prisoners...delightful as childish qualities, but lacking in, shall we say...nuance. Disney tries to make her into an all-wise marriage counselor and social activist do-gooder. As such, Eloise is transformed from a delightful child into a *very adult* sociopathically manipulative prig, which quite ruins the film...as it also ruins real life when people go wrong like that. This was never the character Thompson and Knight developed, who was simply a charming self-absorbed brat...and, by the way, a lot more credible as an actual child. Eloise's future as an adult has been speculated upon. Some think her a likely candidate for alcholism, drug addiction, and perhaps certain dysfunctional sexual disorders, as an adult child of an absentee mother and no father at all, raised in circumstances of artificial material luxury and moral decadence. Such concerns are not unfocused, but since we all know that Eloise will never, and can never, get any older than 6 years of age, they are, I would suggest, unwarranted. Meanwhile, I wish Disney Studios would either go away or do something else. Of course "children of all ages" (sanctimonious children and smug, narcissistic adults who can't or won't grow up) will eat this junk up as Disney knows very well. But I think Kay Thompson would spin in her grave at this PC propagandistic re-working of her own special "inner child" who was so much more real than this Disney caricacture: not despite, but because of, her obvious childish failings. On the plus side, the film's production values could not be better, and the little girl who plays Eloise is...perfect. Julie Andrews is absolutely wonderful as Nanny. The sets are great. I loved the first half hour of this film, before the Disney message (children, especially little girls, are the Master Race) became apparent. It's certainly well done! I did wonder, since there seemed to be an emphasis on making the time frame seem 1950s-like, why the featured toy store was Toys R Us instead of New York's flagship toy store, F.A.O. Schwartz? 
Eloise, she is such fun. And I wish that I could live in the Plaza and share her adventures, and be her 'Mostly Companion.' Eloise played by Sophia Vassilieva was a perfect choice and was absolutely divine. And of course Julie Andrews!!! She is wonderful! Everyone, in this film, is just so wonderful, that you feel that you are there! Everything is realistic, but make believe at the same time! Eloise, the clever, bratty, fun, loveable, sweet, and so caring is just the character that little girls love! This movie is about 4 really main characters: Eloise (of course), Bill (the waiter) Nanny (Nanny), and Rachel, (The Plaza owners daughter). Eloise becomes involved in matchmaking. When Rachel returns from college with her fiance, Eloise and her become friends. And she finds out that Rachel loved the plaza when she was her age. She also finds out that her and Bill are old sweethearts and still secretly in love, against the will of her father who wants her to marry someone of importance. And Brooks, her fiance is in his opinion perfect. But Eloise discovers Brookes secret, and contrives plots to get him out of the way and to put Bill in his place. Whether it's being kidnapped, spying, or helping the awful Mrs. Thornton have a Merry Christmas, Kevin Lima makes Eloise shine in the true spirit of the holidays! Merry Christmas! 
Eloise is a six-year-old girl. While her mom travels the world, Eloise (Sofia Vassilieva) spends most of her time in New York City's Plaza Hotel, where she lives with her "mostly companion", rawther British Nanny (Julie Andrews). Eloise has quite the reputation at the Plaza; all of the employees know her routine daily adventures of curiousity and mischief. Eloise at Christmastime is the second Wonderful World of Disney television movie adapted from Kay Thompson's popular line of picture books. Filmed directly after Eloise at the Plaza, this 2003 film retains director Kevin Lima and all of the relevant cast of its predecessor. It's Christmastime in New York City, and Eloise anticipates her mother's return home. Meanwhile, in her ritual explorations, Eloise discovers a different return: the daughter (Sara Topham) of Plaza owner Mr. Peabody (Victor Young) has come home to be married on Christmas Eve to Brooks Oliver (Rick Roberts), a Harvard-educated young man that Eloise has her suspicions about. Eloise's journeys around the Plaza also uncover that the crabby Mrs. Thornton's days at the Plaza may be numbered, though not as she first assumes. And the precocious girl later learns that her best friend and regular room service provider Bill (Gavin Creel), still has feelings for his ex-girlfriend, the soon-to-be-wed Rachel Peabody who he hasn't seen in years. The film is comfortable in exploring the Plaza with the same pace and perspective of its rambunctious young matchmaker protagonist. It's never in any hurry to bring you the upbeat conclusion you seem to anticipate, instead choosing to bask in the drama and fun of Eloise's experiences. From the title, you can imagine that Christmas figures largely in the film, and it does. We see Eloise going shopping around Manhattan (her ease contrasts with Nanny's struggle to find the perfect gift for Sir Wilkes), adding to her growing list of things she'd like to get, and inadvertently and repeatedly thwarting Nanny's efforts to decorate their suite. But Christmas is one element and not the entire film, so we're not simply getting the same character-transformation tale that's been played out in countless other holiday TV movies. The central story actually seems better developed and more compelling than the screenplay for Eloise at the Plaza did. Whereas that one split its interest more evenly between its royalty and romance subplots, this film primarily focuses on the potential between Bill and Rachel, and Eloise's efforts to put them together. The setting of Christmas adds a layer of depth, but never dominates. All in all, Christmastime succeeds as much as and even more than Plaza, again making good use of Eloise's infectious spirit and this time for a more engaging story. Julie Andrews and the remarkable Sofia Vassilieva have winning chemistry, and their characters' relationship adds a bit of resonance to make the rest of this jovial comedy echo a little more poignantly. Even if it's a tiny bit formulaic, Eloise at Christmastime compares favorably with a good amount of the theatrical live action fare that Walt Disney Pictures have put out in recent years. You will simply love this movie, its one to have in your collection! 
I first saw this movie on television. It is a funny Christmas movie for the entire family. This holiday season grow young through the story of Eloise at Christmastime 
I think that this like Eloise at the Plaza is a great movie. It is one that childern of all ages can really enjoy. I really can't think of anyone that would not enjoy this movie. I also think that Elise At The Plaza, is a great movie for all 
I have 5 children ranging from 14 years to 20 months and they all loved this movie. I rented the video and after watching it went right out and bought it the next day. Eloise was fun, the movie was lighthearted and watchable by all ages. The little girl who plays Eloise was such a gem. Julie Andrews was just as wonderful as Nanny as she was as Mary Poppins. This is a movie I could enjoy watching over and over again. 
This was a funny film about admiring people. Kate Bosworth is perfect in the lead role as a West Virginia grocery clerk who has a crush on a movie star. What she doesn't know is that a fellow employee has similar feelings for her. When she wins a contest to be with the star, the movie star starts idolizing her. Complications ensue. I think this was a romantic movie that had its moments. I recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies. Shake a doo 
This is one of the movies me and my friend turn to when we want a movie that gives you a bubbly warm feeling inside. In the movie, Rosalee (bosworth) is totally in love with big-screen movie star tad Hamilton. tad has a bit of,well,a bad image, and as a hope to clean his image up a bit he teams up with save the children so that with an applicatio and $100 donation, some lucky girl get to go on a date with tad. That girl is rosalee. Tad falls an love with her after the date, and trackes her down in frasier bottom west virginia, meanwhile rosalee's friend pete is madly in love with her. It has one of those feel good ending where rosalee and tad realize that they are not right for eacher other, and after a small chase rosalee and pete end up together. Now they need a sequel for pete and rosalee 
Win a Date with Tad Hamilton is such an adorable movie. Certainly not one I'd recommend to the guys, but for all of us ladies, this movie's a treat. Bosworth is cute and refreshing in this romantic comedy. I love Topher Grace from That 70's Show, but his character in this is quite similar to his bumbling Eric Forman. Still, that didn't stop me from enjoying this film. I think every woman at some point in her life has dreamt of what it would be like to go out with the celebrity of their dreams. If you're a fan of romantic comedies, you'll absolutely adore this little movie that claimed a big chunk of my heart. Very rewatchable and very recommended. 
This is a sweet comedy with alot of formula but it works! Sometimes you have to fight for love and it takes something like a movie star moving in on the girl to push you to action. Predictable but funny. Isn't love worth fighting for 
She is unrealistically cute in this movie! THis is a movie i would never have gone to or rented, but it happened to be on some movie channel and I saw Kate Bosworth and man she is so adorable and cute and whatever so I watched the second half, and thought, this aint half bad of a movie, as a matter of fact i think i like it alot. SO i kept a look out and next time it came I i watched it all and really enjoyed it. Without Kate Bosworth this movie would have not been so great, she makes it what it is because she is uniquely cute the plot is that she works in a grocery store where the dorky, half-mast eyed manager likes her but she wins a date with tad hamilton who turns out to be not such a punk but he can't come up with good lines to say to her, so he steals the dorky guys lines, but when she fines out on the plane, she makes him take her back to the dorky guy, who is getting advice from the troglodyte bartender chick who thinks he's really hot. There is a GREAT LINE in this movie said by the bartender, which was worth the price of admission (free on my tv): "Everybody is Tad Hamilton to somebody" (usually somebody they wouldnt be caught dead with, but its nice to know anywayz... 
I loved it is cute! I really liked the parts about Rosalee having 6 smiles its cute! It was a little on the predictable side though. I really did like the ending though 
Hollywood occasionally produces a underrated, sweet, and genuinely fun romantic comedy that flies beneath everyone's radar. Win a Date With Tad Hamilton is one of those movies. Perhaps because of the unwieldy title, or because it was surrounded by more hyped movies when it was released, it never got the recognition it deserved. Starring a radiant Kate Bosworth, a sweet and touching Topher Grace, and a suprisingly good Josh Dushamel, Win a Date flips the romantic formula a bit, pitting an ordinary hometown boy against the perfect, square-jawed hollywood star, all for the love of an innocently beautiful woman. Rosalee Futch, played by the radiant Kate Bosworth, is a prototypical, naive, romantic downhome small town girl. She has a sweet widower dad(Gary Cole), a quirky friend, and a job at the local Piggly Wiggly with her life long buddy, Pete (Topher Grace), who is hopelessly in love with her, but never has acted on it.(this is not suprising though. If you are best friends with the perfect woman, you will sometimes take friendship over potential rejection) There is just something about Grace as an actor though, that is sweet and endearing, and makes you root for him. Meanwhile, Rosalee's favorite Hollywood star, Tad Hamilton(Josh Dushamel) is having a few problems with the tabloids splashing his boozing, womanizing, reckless behavior all over the front pages. In need of some image makeover, his same-named management team (Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes) creates a old Hollywood style Win a Date contest, which Rosalee wins. Not all that suprisingly, Rosalee sparks something inside Tad on their date, and he chases after her back to her small town in West Virginia, where he must compete with Pete for her love. Funny, sweet, and occasionally dorky, Win a Date is a fine movie for a evening at home, and a nice addition to a romantic comedy collection. 
I can't believe I'm saying this.....it's a great movie! My wife wanted to see this movie and forced me to sit there and watch it. I'm glad she did! Look I'm not saying that this is Life Is Beautiful but for what it is it's dam good! Bosworth shines radiantly (unlike the Beyond the Sea disaster). Duhammel steals every scene he's in. And Ginnifer Goodwin is OUTSTANDING in what is supposed to be a flunky role. She turns it around and is memorable as the lighthearted sidekick for Bosworth. She's extremely attractive to boot! Kind of like Jennifer Tilly with a whole lot more class and without the irritating baby voice. As for Mr. Tophar.....well.....I did find him a bit grating.....sorry. I would have preferred somebody like Toby McGuire but not enough to dimminish this fine piece of fluff. So do yourself a favor and buy it. I'm sure you'll want to see it over and over again. A winner 
When I saw that the movie was from the creators of Legally Blonde, I figured it would be original and hilarious, boy was I wrong. It is so ridiculously predictable, I mean they should have put a twist somewhere in the plot. The plot wasnt even that great. When Topher Grace was trying to show is affection for Kate Bosworth he was being too mean and way too obvious. I mean Kate Bosworth's character had to be stupid not to see that Topher was in love with her. Plus Bosworth's character was quiet annoying. Her hair was bothering me the whole movie, and that whole retainer thing at dinner was such a weird part. I agree with another review who said "what 22 year old would wear a retainer let alone take it out on a date with a moviestar" let alone on a date with a human, it was gross. I would not recommend this movie , entirely too predictable and too lame to enjoy. 
This movie was superb. I wish it was available in PAL (not just US/Canada's NTSC format). I was both inspired not only with it's hysterical, insightful humour, but with it's global appeal. It brings out themes that EVERYBODY can relate to, not only the diverse and often lovable flaws in families, but personal problems and insightfully familiar life themes. The movie has great wit and side splitting humour. It's such fun to watch and this man is a star! He really should be more widely recognised world-wide, a fantastic film that will leave you feeling inspired and wanting to watch more of this wonderful character. Time to come and do a show in South Africa too! What a talent!!! 
i FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE ME AND MY HUSBAND. AND THAT IS FUNNY BECAUSE USUALLY WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME TASTE IN MOVIE 
Great entertainment for the whole family. Tyler Perry can present the most serious problems in this country today, and still make you laugh 
Anything Madea is in is worth watching! This movie had it all. I loved it 
A large cast of well known actors such as Cicely Tyson do an outstanding job in this movie. Tyler leaves you with that warm and fuzzy feeling 
This is a good movie! It is better than Diary of a mad black woman 
Nope, it is not funny. Some people might not consider me qualified to review this, as I did not even finish watching it, but personally, I was highly offended. Madea is nothing more than violent and abusive. End of story. Once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child, I had to turn it off, as I was highly disturbed. Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way. I am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse. And all the other scenes were extremely boring. Do not watch this movie, unless you think abuse is funny, and then you are just sick 
Blair Underwood own's this movie.. He plays an abusive fiance with a passion for getting his kicks off, by beating the love of his life everyday. Bret Fetzer, (movie reviewer) is not abreast to the diversity of Blair Underwood's brilliant performances such as, Just Cause, (1995) and Asundar (1998), in which he plays a psycopath. Be it psycopath, sociopath you name it and Blair Underwood will claim it!! 
To those who "hate" this movie, please forgive us culturally depraved, lowly, bottom-feeding scum for daring to appreciate the pure entertainment and moral value of a polished, well-intentioned movie that seeks to depict the good and bad within our diverse African-American attitudes and ways of life. Let's not forget that this is just a movie, and Tyler Perry has ingeniously used this medium in a way that doesn't take itself too seriously. Only someone with more of an open mind could appreciate that and know that there are some things you simply won't "get" not being African-American. That doesn't mean everyone who's black will like this film -- but clearly by the majority of reviews on this web site, there's a reason this film rates so highly among us "po, ignorant" dark masses! :) Tyler, keep doing what you're doing! Signed, a lover and participant of all legitimate art, both "high" and "low" as long as it's relevant. Peace 
This show is absolutely hilarious, but it is unpolished and can be difficult to watch at times. It falls short of the "brilliant" label some attach to it, but you have to appreciate the risky and absurd humor given the time period this show aired (1990-ish) and the catatonic-drooling-on-your bib-while-you-are-spoon-fed-oatmeal-Full House-Uncle Joey-has-two-dates-at-the-same-time-oh-what-to-do humor of the time. The same can be said for Its Garry Shandling's Show ('86-'90), which I would also like to see released on DVD. Please. The Zoo Animals on Wheels episode is a classic. On the first DVD, the Prettiest Day of My Life and Bored Straight are two of my favorite all time episodes. But - Where are the other episodes? Rhino, my niece can copy the DVDs for you if you're busy. She knows how to do it. She has plenty of free time. Just let me know 
To charge a ridiculously high price for an abridged release of any TV series is a crime. In this case it only adds insult to injury. This TV show was never fully appreciated, much less promoted in it's original run, which coincided with the early years of The Simpsons. But that can be credited to Fox Television's still relatively early, unsure of itself years when it wasn't quite sure where to emphasize its marketing. Nevertheless, that's no reason to perpetuate that crime in its DVD release. Chris Elliott was perfectly cast in this role of the live at home with the folks, 30 year old paper boy. It gave him an avenue of extention for the dry wit he demostrated in his years on David Letterman (who can forget, the man under the stands, and his Marlon Brando routines on that show). Watching this show you can see where producers cast him as the lead in "Cabin Boy," again, another unappreciated work. The wit and sarcasm are the same, as is the way he irks those around him, including his own folks, which includes his real life dad Bob Elliott of classic old time radio fame, and Elanor Donahue of "Father Knows Best" and "Andy Griffith," where she played a before her time sexy pharmacist named Ellie. I give this series 2 stars merely due to the quality of the episodes themselves, which was the perfect marriage of writers who worked around Elliotts' delivery and humor. On that it should get a 5, but the collection offered here is a disgrace. This show ranks as one of the top 2 TV shows to get cut short before given a fair chance, along with "Police Squad," which at least was given a second life in movie theaters via "The Naked Gun" movies. Elliott deserved better than just "Cabin Boy" towards that end. Try again on the DVD release boys. Either do it right, or it shouldn't have been done at all 
It is ridiculous to only release this hilarious show in such small increments! It is my favorite sitcom of all time, but I refuse to buy it unless they put out a set including all the episodes, or at least the entire first season 
I always remembered this show for a few different reasons. Maybe because of how freaking stupid this guy was and some of the bizarre plots. I always remembered this one episode imparticular. The one where they build the submarine and put it in their bathtub. I always thought about that one whenever I would talk to someone about this show. So when I saw they were availiable I had to get them both. But the only thing wrong is they need to release all of the shows. If you like weird comedy please buy and enjoy. If you don't get yourself straightened out and watch it as well. 
I have to say I am a fan of Chris Elliott and have watched him in many different shows and movies and always liked his kind of down-trodden sarcastic wit, and I think Get A Life was a great example of his odd talents in the later episodes. The earlier episodes that are available on DVD (all 8) are not really the best examples of his work. They are funny but the later episodes with "Gus", "Larry", and "Sharon" crack me up. I am tired of seeing this limited run of only a few select early episodes available through DVD, it's time to release the rest or at least a few more...I mean if shows like "Saved by the Bell" can be a box set on DVD then I think the flood gates have been opened. Release the rest of the Episodes Rhino, what are you waiting for? 
This DVD offers a rare opportunity to some of us; the diehard fans of this sitcom, which appeared on Fox Network in late 1980s and 1990s. This is one of the few funniest TV comedies ever created that did not succeed in TV ratings because it was not aired on a major network. This show is about a 30 year old paperboy who never grows up in every sense of the word. He lives with his retired parents and run into all kinds of zany, sometime off-beat antics that provides entertainment to young and old. It was quite disappointing to many of us that it did not reappear in reruns, but this DVD offers a rare opportunity to view four episodes. All episodes are funny, which offers great value for the money. Let us hope the success of this DVD may persuade producers of the show to market all episodes, and a DVD with 12 episodes is made available to all the fans 
I am a fan of several of Atom Egoyan's films, and was curious about the milieu of this one. Since seeing it, I find my mind drifting back to it with some consistency; empirically speaking, I know it affected me on some levels that I'm only dimly aware of. I thought Kevin Bacon's take on a character meant to remind us of the older Jerry Lewis was rich and daring; Colin Firth made an indelible impression as his straight man, the repressed but debonair Brit standing in for Dean Martin's suave Italian-American. Alison Lohman seems not quite up to her key role, and I found myself wondering if Egoyan might have had someone more cerebral like Sarah Polley (he cast her so perfectly in The Sweet Hereafter) in mind instead. A classic whodunit dressed up in artsy chronology, you will find yourself changing your mind a few times about what really happened before the final scenes 
Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found "Truth" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass 
Sad to say that many of the fashions worn in the 70s are back on the racks at the mall these days, but that's off the topic. I enjoyed this movie, and that's a rare thing. The bouncing back and forth in time got to be very confusing and irritating, but in spite of that, the movie survived. While I could have done without quite as much of the sex scenes (really, some subtlety could have conveyed the information just as well), I didn't find them as offensive as some (like those in Deadwood). Just relax, let the lines blur, and see if you have any of those 70s drugs left.. 
Actually a really good movie, but trying hard to mimic Hitchcock and failing. The reason for the failure is flipping back and forth between time periods and POVs as well as trying to have too many elements in one viewing; which was never a Hitchcock failing. You have to watch this one more than once, then even watch the deleted scenes on the DVD, to get the full story, and there's a couple of elements I still find confusing or contradictory and gave up. The problem is trying to tell too much story, the basic devise of using a period film setting (circa 1970) to have a young journalist investigate the partnership of a famous comedy duo of the 50s and why they broke up, or rather what happened the week before they broke up, which happens to be the same week she met the duo as a child when she was a guest on their annual telethon (you see where this is going? but don't think too much of martin and lewis but rather how much the screenplay is already working real hard to establish relevance). The night before said journalist (as a child) met the entertainment stars a young woman died, and this woman was later found in the stars' hotel suite. No blame accorded; ruled a suicide. All the journalistic Ws (who, what, when, where, why) basically swept under the rug. Stylish though the presentation of all this is, the fact is the story of the duo itself is the real film, their relationship and career, and even the butler-assistant who works for one of them. The dead girl, and the journalist, so much time is spent on them when they're not what holds the film together. It's really about what happened to that team, and you'd like to see their rise to stardom: more about the ins and outs of the business, especially during a time when entertainers performed in clubs, and those clubs were controlled by mob bosses;, the rise of narcotic use and the acceptance and encouragement of alcohol abuse (peculiar to the 50s). All of that is what's really interesting, and glimpsed, but unfortunately, the format and the pacing don't leave us much time to enjoy duo's background and the performances of tried-and-true Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth, both of whom age convincingly (about 15 years) but unfortunately they don't bring off the stage appeal and comedy talent/timing required though they try hard. In fact, they try so hard the internal sweat is visible. But the screenplay doesn't live up to the duo's legend, let's say. In sum, a couple of sexy scenes, one for the lesbian lovers, another for providing the hint of a reason why the comedic duo remained unmarried yet broke up, despite all the skirt-chasing. And the dead girl? One of their shared beauties; a stunning actress who manages to steal the film in her scenes 
This movie is a fast ride and a lot of fun. It is the furthest thing from a slow-moving documentary. The technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer. The Source is glossy and gorgeous. The director's clout is also impressive. Johnny Depp gives a performance monologue as Jack Kerouac and John Torturro gives an emotional reading from "Howl." Dennis Hopper imitates Burroughs as well later in the film. Their efforts are impressive. Just to let the skeptics out there know, there is no room for doubt in this documentary. The beats are heroes and saviors--and not much else is considered. That some of them were minor talents is brushed over. Massive beat generation fans would give it five stars. A totally sanitized version of William S. Burroughs is presented, and it is implied that Kerouac was only a heterosexual, which is something that most commentators would regard as dubious. The film's attitude towards drug use is rather slanted. One memorable quotation was, "you can overdose on anything including sushi." Well no, not really. It does not matter though, the movie is an amazing sprint and it succeeds in making itself impossible to turn off. 
This is a serious documentary on the beat / hippie movement. It has tons of old footage and interviews with many of the most prominent beat figures like Ginsberg, Kerouac, Burroughs, Corso, Ferlinghetti etc etc. It has historical footage of events like the Democratic National Convention in '68 and the be-in in San Francisco in '67. This is the perfect movie for someone who loves the beats or someone who has never heard of them. I didn't know much about them when i first watched this documentary on PBS, but after watching it i immediately became interested in their movement. I started reading a lot of the major works like On The Road, Naked Lunch, and Howl and turned into a major fan. This movie is exceptionally well-made and presented. It does have some Hollywood stars like Johnny Depp, but they are only reading the works of Beat authors, and do not have a major role. This is just a great documentary which contains valuable information and interviews with major beat characters who have since passed away. This is a must have for any fan of the beats, hippies, yippies, drugs, american literary movements, the counterculture, or just good documentaries in general. I absolutely love it and have watched it several times 
"The Source" is an excellent documentry on 'The Beat Generation'. It was so good I saw it twice in the theaters. The documentry has a wealth of new material as long as familiar classic footage. My personal favorite writer Jack Kerouac came out of the beat generation and it was fantastic to see him and learn more about him. The documentry always explores other key figures like :Ginsberg, Burroghs, Cassidy among others. Three actors recite famous works by Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroghs. Johnny Depp and Dennis Hopper do fair jobs at working with material by Kerouac and Burroghs but Chuck Workman slaughters Ginsberg's poem "Howl". The only fault about this documentry was the previous and that it had to end. Check "The Source" out 
This is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject. The clips of Ginsberg &amp; Burroughs are especially effective. The celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself &amp; not just empty theatrics. The Beats are still a source to return to for inspiration &amp; insight. The world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now. Of course there's more, but this video gives you enough to get you started &amp; gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late 
When Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs set out in their writing, they had no idea what it would create - a whole movement. This film, including interviews taken when Ginsberg and Burroughs were alive, assembles clips from media, film, and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats up to the passing-away of Ginsberg and Burroughs. With a large assembly of other beat writers and the poets they influenced (Carroll and Bukowski), it is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement. It is interesting to see the Beat propaganda of the sixties, how negative and mocking the media treated the sense of a "cool" movement; they painted a false portrait. This film is for lovers of Beat or people genuinely interested. However, if you do not like documentaries, you won't like this one. Also, I was disappointed to see Depp, Hopper, and Turturro reciting long pieces of work when the actual writers could have performed it. Honestly, I skipped these parts. I wanted to see Ginsburg doing "Howl." Another disappointment is the DVD version, which was slapped together on the fly. I envisioned additional clips and useful information (let's face it, you can put TONS on a DVD), but only had 2 or 3 screens of names credited for making the movie and the trailer (in this case, not exciting). However, with all disappointments aside, this film is good for a few viewings. It conveys a better picture of the Beats than other films have before and enjoyed alot of the material 
Comming of age in the 80's is getting made fun of lately, but I thought it was a good time to grow up with the exception of the advent of AIDS. People were dieing so fast and I lost teachers to that. It was not like today. This movie is really good and in the 1980's style. It is a great comedy. If you like the 80's and want to understand some of the refrences in the media where they keep saying Bueller repeated times see this movie. You will also get to see where the guy who does the clear eyes comercials go his start in this movie. Anyway perhaps you just might like the 80's if you do not already if you watch some of these good comming of age movies and listen to our music 
Bueller, Ferris Bueller OK, lets start off with what wrong with this edition of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. there are two problem I see with this new Bueller Bueller DVD edition of Ferris...One is the over use of actor/know it all Ben Stein and the missing director John Hughes's missing audio commentary. Now the good news. There are extras like a few great documentries with most of the cast talking about this movie. And then there is the movie itself-The extras are fine. However the film is a minor classic. Matthew Broderick emits an air of whimsey with a wink of his eye. Broderick's odyseey of adventure isnt lost on his audience. He is part Robert Preston from the Music Man/Part W.C. Fields/Part Robert Wagner from It Takes a Thief. Broderick playing Ferris is slick, sly and a con man with style. He pokes a stick of his collective eye of Principal Jeffrey (Deadwood) Jones and we are laughing at his antics with enjoyment. The supportive cast of Alan (Spin City) Ruck and Mia Sara makes a sorta lover's triangle without love nor passion..more deeper friendship. The two combined with Broderick makes this film a buddy movie, rather than a TEEN angst film (like Not another Teen Movies or Ten Things I hate about you) So want to laugh and enjoy the system being poked, get this film and as Ferris would say, "What are you Still doing here? Why aren't you buying this yet?" Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL 
Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another "sick" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: "Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it." That's the moral of the story, really. "Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?" Not here, but he'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life, and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day 
Perfect movie for everyone. No matter how many times I watch the movie it is always funny. Whether you are stll in school or schools days are behind you this movie will make you feel good. 
Matthew Broderick stars in this very funny film about a high school student who decides to take a day off of school. What happens next can only be described as remarkable and somewhat crazy. Broderick stars as Ferris Bueller, a somewhat clever and deceitful (in a funny way) high school senior who, along with his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) decide to skip school and visit the sights and sounds of downtown Chicago in springtime. Ferris convinces Cameron to take his father's prized red Ferrari out for the day. Reluctantly, Cameron agrees, and soon the two are off on their adventure. Their next plan is to get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school so she can go along. Ferris and Cameron devise a plan to call the school and tell Dean of Students Ed Rooney (Jeffery Jones) that Sloane's grandmother passed away. Dressed in a long trenchcoat and hat, Ferris arrives at the school to pick up Sloane, and the three drive happily away. However, Mr. Rooney suspects that something is up and immediately suspects that Ferris is at the root of it. He sets off to find Ferris himself and bring him back to school. By the end of the movie, Mr. Rooney probably wishes he had stayed in his office. Meanwhile, Ferris' sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) has figured out what Ferris is really doing. Angry that Ferris seems to get away with everything, she has to deal with the entire school taking up a collection for poor, sick Ferris while she really knows what is going on. In the end, though, she proves to be a big help to him. After heading downtown, the trio take the Ferrari to a local parking garage. Cameron's father knows the exact mileage of the car, so Cameron is already nervous about allowing Ferris to drive it. But that's just the beginning. The garage attendant decides to take the car out for a joyride and racks up over 180 more miles on the odometer. During their day,Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane manage to see the Sears Tower, a Cubs game, visit the Art Institute, and see Ferris sing "Twist and Shout" from a parade float. But when they head back to the garage to get the car, Ferris finds out about the extra mileage, and Cameron goes crazy. Ferris seems to think that by driving backwards that the miles will come off, so they jack the car up in the garage and put it in reverse. However, the miles don't come off. Cameron, having suffered through a tumultuous relationship with both of his parents, takes out his aggression on the car. Soon, it goes careening out of the back of the garage and lands in a pile of trees. Cameron actually feels relieved because now his father will actually have to talk to him. But Ferris realizes that he has only 5 minutes to get home before his parents do. Will he make it in time? This movie has attained a sort of "cult" status over the years and still remains as funny as ever. Matthew Broderick is perfect as the scheming Ferris, while Jeffery Jones does a very good job as Mr. Rooney. Jennifer Grey plays the part of the overlooked and jealous sister perfectly, and Alan Ruck's job as the reluctant and somewhat confused Cameron is the perfect companion to the wild and reckless Ferris. Let's not forget the funny cameo by Ben Stein as the teacher who coined the term "anyone, anyone, Bueller?" I recommend this extremely funny movie very highly. The acting is great and the story is very funny. As a Cubs fan, I was glad to see the scenes in Wrigley Field and hear Harry Caray's voice. Watch this great movie and see how much trouble and mischief three friends can get into in one day 
One of John Hughes best films,Ferris Bueler made me laugh harder than any other Hughes film. The though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were him.I love this film 
I could watch this over and over again! It's so funny! The person who dissed women's manly handshakes is a sexist! But anyway, I would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch! Definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too.....for one viewing per 5 months. Don't force it on them is my advice!! Rock o 
This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller. This is a classic that every high school student should see. It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best. It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star 
A movie with one good line after another, funny and interesting characters and lttle vignettes of hilareous bit part players. Just a great funny movi 
I really like this DVD. I watched it all the way through on the first viewing, but will have to go back again and again. There's just so much stuff in there, fast paced and never boring; and everytime it came to an end of a section, I got up to turn it off, only to be greeted with more. I picked-up several good tips that were worth the price of admission; not to mention the dozens and dozens more that I will have to go back and evaluate to see if they're for me. A convivial host, I only wish he spent more time on landscape, and less time on Pumas. Still was very worth it 
As an intermediate photographer I found this dvd very enjoyable. Its packed with useful information, geared primarily towards the beginner to intermediate photograper. Jim keeps the terminology very simple and his instructions are easy to follow and understand. He covers many aspects of Photography from composition, lighting, locations, as well as camera functions, etc. And he doesn't overwhelm you with technical jargon. All in all, a nice dvd for anyone looking to improve their photography. And even for advanced photographers, it could serve as a nice refresher course. I would also recommend his book 'The BetterPhoto Guide to Digital Photography' as many of the subjects and pictures from the dvd are included in more detail 
The DVD is excellent, as far as I got to see it. Unfortunately, about two thirds of the way through the picture or my DVD player went nuts and I never got to see the last part. I tried several times. Perhaps I am having a DVD player problem but it plays others without a problem 
This is an excellent introduction to photography (Film or Digital). It was a little basic for me but on the other hand it was good to do the review of basics. I gained alot from the instructions on techniques. I recommend it for anyone except the very advanced photographer 
Adventures in Photography with Jim Miotke is drivers ed for anyone looking to get behind the wheel. You'll be exposed to the basics of photography, techniques used by experienced photographers, and tips that will leave you anxious to get out the door and into the field with your camera gear. The practical applications demonstrated, the beautiful locations used, and the easy style of instruction by Jim Miotke makes this DVD easy to watch, easy to learn, and a real gem for your library. 
This DVD has Excellent photography instruction and Tips.Very easy to understand Jim very clear with His instruction and tips . The scenery is beautiful,colorful and full of pretty place and animals . I really enjoyed the whole DVD and the instructions. A great investment for anyone who wants to improve their photography. Must own and make wonderful gift for anyone who loves photography 
It was very good. In real life situations you are not going to find a place with a trainer to tell the animals when to jump. You are going to be out alone and not set up with a trainer to tell the animals when to jump. so you can get perfect images. It would be nice,but that is not going to happen 
Digital Photography Unleashed By Jim Miotke is exciting and excellent learning method.The DVD is colorful,full of scenic beautiful places ,animals and very simple clear instructions on hot to adjust setting of the camera. It was very useful for me.I highly recommend this DVD.I am looking forward to more DVDs like this 
This is just one of the excellent ways Jim M. has found to help even the most intimidated of us who want join the digital photography tech revolution. This video will easily and understandably help you down that road! 
This DVD is great..clear and full of information.I see a hugh difference in my photos using the advice given by Jim Miotke. I highly recommend this DVD 
I watched (and liked) the movie, but it didn't leave room for a -good- series to follow or preceed it, so I didn't hold out high hopes for this. When it was available cheap, though, I decided to pick it up - and I'm very glad I did. This is another version of the same story told in the movie, so treat the two as separate. It brings in Mecha, but not as a dominant feature, as well as aspects of starstruck romance, love triangles, and a bit of fantasy intrigue, blending them into a consistent story. I do think parts were a bit drawn out, and the Isaac Newton reference was a bit silly, but these weren't enough to bring down the story. On the other hand, the characters are multifaceted, bringing a healthy range of emotions into play without seeming forced or trite. I mainly took off a point for the artwork and the plot being drawn out at points. The artist doesn't know how to draw a nose (can't say I do either, but I'm not selling my work), which becomes obnoxious at times. If you can get past the noses, it's well worth a look. 
I was one of those unfortunate enough to catch Escaflowne on fox kids. Truth is that I was hooked. It was one of the first anime I ever saw before I even knew what anime was. I didnt get to see the whole series on fox but I always wanted to see the whole thing and I finally got my chance. This series is truly a gem among anime. It's got a heartfelt story with some action thrown into the mix as well as a bit of comic relief thanks to Merle. True that the characters look a bit funny but that's only at the beginning after a while you completely forget about it and fall completely in love with them flaws and all. It really has nothing in common with the movie other than that the characters are the same so if you didnt like the movie give the series a chance. It has a more fully developed story and really fleshes out the characters better. I enjoy watching dubs so I watched it both in it's original and dubbed. The japanese is great and cant be compared with the subbed but if you are to lazy to read than the dubbed version is fine as well. Plus you get all of the episodes for such a great price. How can you beat that? If you're in the mood for a great story definetly buy this 
Escaflowne was probably the first anime show I ever watched! I was instantly hooked and just had to buy it now even though it's been several years since I saw the show. It's about a 15-year-old girl named Hitomi who gets transported to a mystical world called Gaea. There she teams up with a king, a knight, a princess and others to save their world. It's hard enough being a teenager on earth, but being a teenager trapped on another world, well, you can tell that she'll have difficulties. Not to mention love interests. The fight scenes are good, and I love all of the creative characters such as Merle the cat-girl! Buy it and you won't regret it! It's a great show 
When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne... What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the goddess/protector. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it... If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story). Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece "Dance of Curse" for instance. It reminds one a lot of "Duel of the Fates", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode "mystic eyes". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears. Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne.

Very rarely in my life have I come across a movie that makes me cry. All you would have to do is watch the last 10 minutes of this movie to understand what I'm saying. However, you should see the entire movie - what perfection. It has comedy, drama, and great acting on all parts. Tyrone Power (my favorite actor) gives a grade A performance. Never will you find him as loveable, or as dignified than as Martin Maher, Jr. I find it hard to believe that John Ford (the director) originally wanted John Wayne for this movie. Not to nock Wayne, but Power can convey sensitivity better. As a side note, John Wayne's son Patrick appears in the movie. Maureen O'Hara, lovely as ever, gets back to her Irish roots in this film, and it makes for a point-perfect characterisation from the Queen of Technicolor. It isn't any wonder John Ford loved her as an actress. She's one of the best. The movie spans 50 years at West Point Military Academy, and the life of Martin Maher and the people's lives he touched. It is a great American story. Definitely, worth every bit of the two hours and seventeen minute running time. I love this movie, and if you read this you really should be watching the movie. Seriously, it made me cry!! 
The movie overall is really a great story; the quality of the DVD is what really is what I find as poor quality. It's almost as though some one copied it using a video camera recorder. I already own a copy of the VHS tape and it is a far better version of the film. The actors are classics. I can only say good things about Maureen O'Hara and Tyrone Powers. Ward Bond also. There were others who were in supporting roles who deserve mention; still the story is one that really what is s classic piece of Americana that deserves remembering. 
I first saw this movie at our local in the late 50`s here in the U.K. The Memory of Marty Maher never left.. Looking through Amazon one evening i noticed it was available. Well done it arrived in 6 days. Some things you order locally take longer than that.After all these years since i last saw it it`s still a great movie and still brings a tear to the eye. Tyrone Power was perfect, sadly nearing the end of his life as Marty Maher. Nothing against John Wayne who i understand was the first choice but this was`nt his part. Maureen o Hara is wonderful. Ward Bond as "That blackhearted master of the sword" as Marty calls him and Donald Crisp as Marty snr. Its a long movie covering 50 years but never you loose interest. Its perfect. John Ford wanted to be remembered as the man who made westerns. Well he made other great movie`s as well. In my opinion this is an equal to The Quiet Man....The Long Gray Line. The best Ford without John Wayne 
This is a good old fashioned film similar to the English film 'Goodbye Mr Chips'. It has lots of old fashioned values and contains humour, pathos, passion and sentimentality which will tug at the heart strings!!! I defy anyone not to have a lump in the throat or a tear in the eye when the long awaited Marr baby dies shortly after birth, or when James 'Red' Sandstrom Jr. comes to vist Marty at Christmas with his mother. I just love the whole tone of the film - the director has got the atmosphere just right. A real cracker of a film lacking in any real violence or nastiness I am pleased to say. It is a film I can watch again and again. Even my husband, normally quite reticent with such films, was impressed. That to me was praise indeed 
Highly enjoyable tale of the life of Marty Maher, the Irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become West Point's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years. Despite personal tragedies, and through two World Wars, Maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished Army officers' academy, including future legends like Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Tyrone Power is excellent and compelling as he portrays Maher from young idealist to elderly sage, Irish accent intact all the way. The scenery and West Point pageantry is fun to watch (although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio -- but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the Military Academy). Interestingly, there's not really all that much football in this film -- there's a little, but it's mainly the story of Maher and his family, and the young men he came to love like his own sons. With the flame-haired Maureen O'Hara as Maher's Irish wife Mary, giving a radiant performance. Sentimental in that '50s way, of course, but the legendary director John Ford (working with a cast made up of many of his favorites) always puts a bite behind the sweetness 
Pixar has proven its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices. But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by harkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity. The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win "The Piston Cup." But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on "the highway." Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film. Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly. That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout 
Cars is an excellent Pixar movie. It's a car version of Thomas The Tank Engine with storyline references to Doc Hollywood, but it's easily the 2nd best Pixar movie topping Finding Nemo. The DVD has great special features such as an epilogue and the Inspiration of Cars. I enjoy the animated short films One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight. The folks at Pixar have done it again brining in a great story, great characters, plenty of eye-popping computer animated effects. I especially am into vehicles 
I collect all the "Pixar" movies. This one is exceptional 
my son does too. we have been watching it again and again and again for the last 3 days, and neither has gotten tired of it yet. why we love it? cause of the way cars are made into persons by means of graphics (the expressions and "faces" thay have and make) and acting. cause of the story - it's warm and fuzzy and funny :) cause of the way story is paced; it never gets boring and slow, but it doesn't kill you with the tempo either. cause its beautifully done (not to say "drawn, cause we know it isn't just drawing any more) - the characters, the details on them, the city, racetrack, nature.. one of my all-time favorites. 
I tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released. Not up to normal/past Pixar standards. I say it is most like A Bugs Life. A good but not great film. Music did nothing for me. Where was the normal stand out musical score? Standard extras, BUT no Making Of section. I would have liked to have seen that. SOMETHING I HATE ABOUT SOME DVD PACKAGES. THOSE HORRIBLE FLIP DOWN OPENERS. YUCK!!!!!! Kids will enjoy. Nascar fans will enjoy. Fun but forgettable after you watch it. 
I'm a language teacher and I have a number of DVDs that I use at school as language tools. DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English. Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD. I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I suppose it's my fault for assuming, but I feel ripped off just the same 
This is a great pixar movie. This is my personal favorite pixar film. It is extremely good graphics. The director went on tracks to see how the track would look, and asked real nascar narraters to do the narrating for the race scenes. The plot is very good. Its about a car named Lightning MC Queen. His life was racing, and he was rude to people. Then he gets... Well you better find the rest out yourself. The jokes are funny, and the cast is so good. This is a great movie for every one. The bonus features are good to. Theres the bloopers but without the credits, and then the inspiration for cars. The sneak peaks are not to good though. There is 5.1 sound and there scene selections are good. There is allot so you can find where you left off. I cant wait untill the 2 disc special edition comes out! This is good movie for everyone from 5 to as old as you get. So I recommend this movie cars. You will have a long road ahead of you! 
This is simply the cutest animated feature I have seen in years. The characters are superb. The art is fantastic. The humor will catch young and old alike, and I do mean young AND old. This is one cartoon that will be appreciated by those in their retirement years. Actually, some of the puns will go right over the heads of the younger crowd. The film had me laughing as much as I have laughed at anything for a l o n g time. Then, just when I thought it was over, a short follow up came after the credits. Then, just when I thought THAT was over, I discovered a couple of shorter animated bonus features and began laughing all over again. I could find no faults. I only have two suggestions: 1. Buy a copy for yourself 2. Buy a copy as a gift for that special someone. 
According to me - CARS is the best the PIXAR studio has made. Toy Story was the first, The Incredibles were action-packed, but the CARS ARE JUST SIMPLY THE BEST! I like the story, I like the superb soundtrack and of course I love the animation. It just made me feel that even cars have soul and feelings... Well maybe it wasnt a feeling but now I really believe that all the cars have feelings 
I absolutely love this movie! It's one of my favorites and I could watch it over and over. It's got good plot, good acting and great child stars. I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE to hasn't seen it yet (if there is any such person) 
This film is one of my all time favorites. I think it's because these kids remind me of my friends and I as kids - riding our bikes, going on little adventures, etc. The cast is absolutely perfect. Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid of all time - with the exception of Ricky Schroeder in The Champ. LOL. River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an adaptation of a Stephen King short story. Part road film, part coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings. 
This movie would have to be one of the most overrated film adaptations of any of Stephen King's books. What you have are 4 losers who go in search of a dead body so that they can get onto the televison nightly news and become "Celebrities". This shows you how sensitive these four kids are. Then to show their delicate sensibilities each one takes his turn at bawling his eyes out. This movie stars the late River Phoenix who was a very Health Conscious guy. He didn't smoke or eat meat but he did like heroin which led to his demise. Sadly both Stephen King and the director of this trash Rob Reiner have confused the experience of adoloescent with a "Sensitivity Training Workshop". And by the way how come everybody in the audience expels blueberry pies? Did they all have the same thing for lunch as the guys in the Pie Eating Contest?I give this movie 5 stars because the Oregon Vistas are quite nice 
When listening to Rob Reiner's commentary on the tragic story of what happened to River Phoenix, one can't help but be moved by the final scenes of this seminal 80's movie. I was a late teenager when I saw this and it clicked perfectly with memories of when I was a kid and had a bunch of buddies that did the normal kid stuff--going camping, riding bikes, getting terrorized by older kids!!!! Anyway, I know I wasn't around during the time period this is set, but the basic themes are universal. Now I'm not going to bore you with a recap of the story--you can read that in another review. Let me just say that the four leads are incredibly natural and give fine performances, even Jerry O'Connell whose first film this is. And of course Kiefer Sutherland is wonderfully menacing !! (No wonder he was a vampire in Lost Boys the next year!) I'm not sure the steady stream of profanity was necessary but then again, I wasn't around during the 50's so maybe that was par for the course. As someone elswhere mentioned, this is an adults kid movie. The dvd extras are fine--it's great to see the cast and director and Stephen King remark on the making of the film. Knowing this was King's favorite adaptation of his work really makes this more affecting. So relive those fun times as a kid if you have seen this before and watch it again. Especially if your an old timer like me--you know, all of 40 years old. And if you haven't seen it before--well, let me just say not to eat any pie before watching it!!! See ya!! 
This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era. 
This is one of the greatest movies ever filmed in Oregon, and I would like to take this opportunity to say that Dillon obviously needs to chill and use some vinegar based cleanser down south and doesn't know his heinie from a hole in the ground 
This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other. When does that ever happen? The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids. What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."? I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense. I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie. 
Setting Theme(s): Castlerock, smallville, summer friends' adventure, life's lessons, solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown. This 1986 instant classic of Rob Reiner's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film. The musical score is dramatic, it sets the tempo from start to finish, and it never misses a beat; each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie's unfolding, and you don't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding. The lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient, lazy summer days of grandeur, to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity. One can in Stand By Me favorably assume to watch: pie eating contests, leeches, trains, train dodging, mail ball, fancy cars, fancy footwork (i.e. Verno's beloved comb's freefall), cantenes (thought they disappeared w/ Ben Franklin's outlets), junkyard dog chases, and much much more. The ending is the real gravy. The narration is superb also. By far one of the favorite films of my youth. Believe John Cusack can be seen playing the role of Gordy's football star elder brother? Stand By Me is the childhood that big city life just doesn't afford, at least not anymore. Everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses; rustic destination spots, like the ones presented in this movie, are still out there folks. With a smidgen of ambition toward adventure, which will take your there, the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated. Although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors. Five stars for Reiners finest photoplay. 
This is a movie unlike anything you have ever seen before. The concepts and possibilities it presents are life altering. The presentation is entertaining, educational, and enlightening. Not to be missed by any person who considers themselves to be progressive or open-minded. Five Stars 
I found this to be an inspiring, thoughtful, and extremely interesting take at the new paradigm of science, quantum mechanics. This movie explains in non-technical terms the philosophical ramifications of the theory (almost universally accepted) and how it is relevant to our everyday lives--even non-physicists. In it are interviews of many well credentialed and credible physicists, philosophers, and theologians, making it engaging for even the most cynical of viewers. Interspersed is a drama showing the theories in action for a regular person. For me, it helps to reconcile spirituality (Christian in my case) and scientific theory whereas before I always felt my love of science and reason were in constant conflict with my spiritual beliefs. No longer! Watch the movie, which is for the most part not dogmatic and not judgmental but instead eye-opening and logically satisfying even for the "religious." I love it 
I had previously bought the 1st version. Liked it very much. So I was eagerly looking forward to this latest version. Happy to know that this version has more new Science related information - which was what I was interested in. And for those who want to just listen to the interviews with the scientist, there is a seperate section entirely on Interviews. The best part is that they have re-interviewed the scientist and they explain more on what they have previuosly said and give more new informations. For those who have not seen the 1st version, I think it is alright to watch this. Viewers are highly adviced to keep their mind open to all the information said in this movie. The interpretation and acceptance of the facts are up to the viewer. Everyday more and more things are being discovered about our world, universe and what they are made of. If you had deep question about the reality, you might find an answer in this movie. -- Ravi, Singapor 
If you loved "What the Bleep Do We Know" you will love "What the Bleep Down the Rabbit Hole." All your favorite academic types appear, with more indept talk about Quantum theory. The expansiveness of the mind and the capacity of creating our own reality plus the challenge of otherness, parallel universes is the dose of what is possible I welcome. I watch either DVD at least monthly. The description of addiction, and how this traps us is another lecture I welcome. The capacity to see life as what I shape it, what I bring to the experience from a consciousness in expanded reality,what I can create is thrilling, and I feel this possibility after viewing either DVD. The only draw back in ". . . Down the Rabbit Hole" is the story line with Marlee Matlin. I would have enjoyed watching that develop and move into the future, instead of rehashing the "Bleep's" story. This is why I gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars. 
This film will change the way you perceive the "natural" world. It's very well done and brings very complicated concepts to light in a simple and comprehensive way. Truly, it's one of the best films I've ever seen 
Its a great movie. It really challenges one to look beyond...What IF............. 
This film allows you to explore places in your heart and mind that you never knew existed. This film is for all those who have questions. It offers ideas, and encourages the viewer to seek his/her own answers. Although a documentary, the film captures the eyes and sucks you in. Professional commentary is done with taste and is integral to the goal of the film. I recommend this film to anyone who wonders, "What is truely reality?"...and "What is this life all about?" 
Simply Fantastic! Anyone with an open mind and a scientific inclination will love this. Some of the subject matter is a bit adult so be mindful before showing this to your children. 
This DVD is explaining things better than the previous version, where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc. Some of the theories are wonderfully animated and explained. The crytal-photography on water meditated upon by the Japanese monk was especially awesome. They have tried their best to explain stuff that cant be easily explained by the western(modern)science .... ofcourse.....it ends in letting you ponder....they have left most of it there. There after one has to go into religion and spirituality - particularly one place where to begin looking for would be at the "Sanathana Dharma" teachings 
This dvd has excellent workout segments. You can do as much or as little as you want and if you do all 5 portions of cardio, upper and lower body, abs, and stretch you get a great workout. Good for both beginners and those at a more advanced level 
I really like the flexibility of this dvd workout. The exercises are great - it is definitely worth the mone 
I was rating anther product and realized I had never rated this one. Denise Austin does a great job here. Yes, she is very enthusiastic and it can be a little much, but she gets me through the workout every time. I absolutely LOVE the multiple options. This DVD will grow with you as you get in shape. She gives alternate moves within the workouts and that coupled with the ability to pick the intensity is just great. I love that the workouts are short and when combined together you get to focus on the areas where you need the most work. When I first started I just did one workout and as I felt better I added to it. This is my absolute favorite workout vide 
I love this dvd. It's very easy to use and you can pre-program what workout you want to do, depending on your time constraints, your own physical needs and level. 1. 20 minute cardio workout. I'm doing the low intensity (a high intensity is also available) cardio and I find it very enjoyable to do. I love all the workouts in this segment - those which include the grapevine, shuffle, lunges, rainbow, and almost all the movements. Even my 3-year old daughter loves them, so she imitates me while watching me workout. I went through the high intensity and for me, the low intensity is a lot more fun. 2. 10 minute upper body. I'm also doing the low intensity (but dvd has medium high too) but instead of the chair, I use the stability ball when I'm doing the weights. I find it's more flexible to do it with a ball than on a chair. 3. 10 minute lower body. I don't consider my lower body a main problem spot, so for now, I skip this section due to time constraints. That's why this dvd is so good, you can choose what you want, depending on your needs! This is also available in low, medium and high intensity. I went through the section, though, and find variety of lower body exercises which I haven't seen some yet. I have to try this when I have the luxury of time. ;-) 4. 10 minute abs. This is my problem spot so I always make it a point to do this all the time. This is tough and you would really feel it working in all sections of your abs. There are a lot of variation in the basic crunches which I find very useful. I hope it works visibly, though! I have a lot of flab hiding my 6-pack. LOL! 5. The last segment is the stretching which is basically the usual stretching we see, but of course, very important in the cool down. All in all, I give this dvd a 5+ stars for being easy to use and the workouts being doable but effective. I guess I'm fast becomming a Denise fan. I enjoy her workouts and for me her talkies are not distracting. But if you get annoyed with her voice, there's also a function to play music only. Buy this, it is worth it 
This is a great workout for me, I just had a baby and need to tone up again. But I don't have a lot of time, so this is perfect. I can usually get in 2 10 min workouts in the morning while the baby sleeps or is having quiet time. I haven't worked out in many months, so it's great to be able to start at beginner! I am sore after the workouts, so I think thye are pretty effective. Looking forward to seeing some results ( I just started 3 days ago! 
I ordered this DVD with high expectations after reading all the reviews! I've got to tell you... it met all of them. You can choose an all Low level, Moderate level or high intensity workout (which includes abs and full body stretch) or you can truly customize your workout. The DVD lets you preset what level you want for every specific workout before you even start so that there aren't any interruptions between the chapters. I almost hate to admit it but... I choose the Low intensity workout starting out. I was sweating more than what I thought I would. I even still found some of the Abs and thigh exercises challenging!! I think that Denise is EXTREMEMLY motivational and can really help you keep up your momentum. I know many times I would remember to tighten my Abs while exercising with her catch phrase, "Zip up those Abs!!" *I would recommend this to everyone at any fitness level because this is a workout that than "grow" with up as you become more fit! 5 stars from me! 
I was very impressed with this DVD and liked the flexibilty of picking and choosing your workout. It gives you many options for your workout which is a nice change from the basic workout programs. I have been a Denise fan for many years and really enjoy her vast and varied collection of exercise, yoga, etc. I recommend this program highly. Linda Snyde 
Denise Austin's training system is easy to understand and to follow. The training system is nice because you can select individual workouts or can choose a pre-set routine geared for the beginner, intermediate or advanced exerciser. I use the advanced level which incorporates hand weights into the 20 minute aerobics routine, similar to a circuit workout. With the exception of the abs portion of the DVD, all exercise sections keep you moving to provide additional aerobic benefits. I own several Denise Austin DVDs and this is one of my favorite. I highly recommend it! 
When I read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts. I thought, "Yeah, right." But you really can pick and chose and combine what you want. You can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio. It is up to you. Or you can choose from the basic low, medium, or high intesity workouts. This is a great workout DVD and Denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part. I'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home 
This is probably my favorite Denise DVD. It is super easy to set up a workout that I want. If I don't have a lot of time I just do strentgh training,which has three levels:easy,mod.,or hard. Each lasts 10 minutes. It also has two 20 minute workouts easy and hard and a kickbutt 10 minute ab workout. The dvd allows you to program whatever workouts you'd like. I started seeing results as far as toned up muscles in two weeks. 
This was a gift purchase. I do know she loves the movie and watches it over and over! 
STRICTLY BALLROOM is a wonderfully campy film that I can watch over and over and enjoy it as much the 10th time (heck, I may have already seen it more times than that!) as I did the first. I'm not into dancing, but this movie has such fun with it that I am considering it as a new interest. However, do not be mistaken about the film's real intent. It is an excellent piece of satire that has relevance to all aspects of life. By the way, I am a MAN who loves John Wayne and Clint Eastwood westerns. STRICTLY BALLROOM may have a title that seems to peg it as a "chick flick", and indeed women will love it, but it's good fun for EVERYONE. 
Ain't it the truth! If you haven't seen this movie yet, you are SO LUCKY because you get to see it for the first time. Terrific plot, actors, dancing, VILLAINS BOO HISS, and one of the sexiest men on the planet, Antonio Vargas. (swoon) This isn't a life-altering film for most people, but I've probably said "As they said in 'Strictly Ballroom,' 'a life lived in fear is a life half-lived'" a hundred times, sometimes laughing and sometimes crying. Good and useful and true words. 
When I'm fairly certain that the world just may not be unfolding as it should, the temperature is near 100, and the U. S. casualties from the War In Iraq now have reached over 2,500-- the newscasters rarely give figures of anyone else--STRICTLY BALLROOM is one of a handful of films that always makes me smile. Set in Australia and directed by Baz Luhrmann, it's all about winning the Pan Pacific Grand Prix ballroom dancing competition. Besides the extraordinary dancing by the two principal actors Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice, the story is one that most of us want to believe: that in the end-- after all that's what happens in romantic comedies-- boy gets girl, ugly duckling becomes suave swan, the older generation get a chance to try things again, or at least see their broken dreams achieved by their children, and good triumphs over the cynical, bad guys. In addition to the fine performances by Mercurio and Morice, the other actors are quite wonderful, particularly the Hasting parents. Golden hair color not found in nature and toupees abound, as does delicious humor. Leave it to the Aussies to do everything right in a movie. 
Australian humor and quirky romantic comedy Strictly Ballroom is a gem from down under. When Paul Hastings loses his partner because of new moves on the dancefloor, he gets the ugly duckling Fran who is as gutsy as he is. Both are brave enough to compete in the Pan Pacific competition with their new moves and all 
What a kooky, lovable, sometimes just much too silly movie. I absolutely love it. It is one of my favorite movies of all times. In fact, after seeing it, I immediately began learning Salsa. I'll pass on the Pasa Doble, thanks. Though "Scott" is supposed to be the focus of the film, "Fran" steals the show after she washes her face and puts on something nice. In fact, she and Scott's father (both rather pathetic characters) steal the show. Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! I think I'll put the DVD in right now! 
Brilliant movie - the likes of Monsoon Wedding. Many little dramas inside the big picture. Very appealing to see more than once to pick up on all the detail. Very real people, very interesting to see the likes of whom you know in your own community in Aussie setting. Heaven forbid that someone gets it in their minds to do a remake on this one. The charm is in the 'tatty' old fashioned glit 
When I first watched this movie, I sat there and wondered 'what the hell is this all about?'. I sat there and wondered if the cast was on acid. Then I went away, and for the oddest of reasons, it kept on coming back into my mind. So I bought the DVD and watched it again. It's one of those movies that the more you watch, the more enjoyable it becomes and the more you can appreciate it. There is a plot of which to speak of, though it's stock standard and waterthin, but the plot is incidental to the music, dancing and pacing. It certainly goes down in my top 10 favourite movies 
A movie to enjoy watching many times. Very entertaining and light. 
Simply wonderful movie! Combination of "Carmen" (the flamenco film, not the opera, and if you have never seen that, well, do), and "The Cutting Edge", with lots of hysterical satire thrown in. Male lead not bad to watch and a very good dancer - his partner was not so skilled. They were sort've like Torvil and Dean (of Olympics fame) on the dance floor. This film won the Australian Oscar. Rather formulaic plot; the dancing is the thing here 
The first two episodes of Volume 5 are a little bit uncharacteristic of the usual Ghost in the Shell emotional range. In episode 17, the Major travels to Taiwan in search of more info about Kuze, but instead surrenders to her maternal instincts by stepping in between a teenage boy and a local gang war. The next episode features Batou as the main star as he and the Major are taken away from the Kuze case to help an international effort succeed in nailing an infamous terrorist bomber. Batou begins to become attached to a young handicapped girl who mysteriously seems to be looking right at him, even when he's in camouflage mode, which should render him invisible to the naked eye. Even though Kuze was a member of the Individual Eleven, which wanted to drive all refugees out of Japan, it seems he's switched sides now, and is the main driving force of the rapidly escalating insurrection of the refugees. When Section 9 gets wind that Kuze wants to get his hands on atomic weapons, the stakes get dramatically higher! This series gets better and better, even outshining the first season since 2nd Gig is dealing with an issue that is really upfront and center in the US right now. If you've made it this far, then you'll know just how amazing the writing is on this show. Even after all the years spent with these characters, you can still find nuances in their reactions and be charmed that no matter how mechanized their bodies become, their "ghost" still remains and makes them human, even the Major, whose body is full prosthetic! The art and animation is the best I've ever seen in a TV anime, and you have to marvel at how they pulled off the budget to make it. Classic stuff. Extras: Interviews with Japanese voice actors who play Motoko, Batou, Togusa, Borma, and the director Kenji Kamiyama. 
I'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 DVDS ago, and it continues with this volume. As for the episodes themselves, They were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs, everything comes to a head and resolves. Looking back on the four episodes, the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in Japan. This was not enough for a point deduction. At the end of the day, anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons. You will not be disappointed. 
Long Awaited! As a big ER fan I was was glad to finally get this season! I WISH they would come out them faster 
Season five was a season of comings and goings in the venerable Thursday night NBC drama. Despite the second major cast member checking out in two years, the show continued to be strong and the foundations of one relationship that would continue on for a number of years was set in place at the end of season five. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) and Doug Ross (George Clooney) haven't always agreed on the way they practice medicine or how to deal with authorities, but they are both great doctors and despite their differences, are also pretty good friends. Season five sees Greene trying to walk the fine line of friend and manager as he copes to deal with Ross' basic disregard for authority. The pediatrician finally goes over the line with one terminally sick boy, breaking every protocal, which eventually leads to his departure from the Cook County General emergency department. Clooney was quickly becoming a big star on the big screen and a burgeoning movie career was pulling him away from his weekly television series, so when the time came to go, he left. This was a pretty big blow to the cast, the second original member to leave in two years (Sherry Stringfield's Dr. Susan Lewis left in season three), but as has been the case, the show continued on with great additions to the cast to take the place of Clooney. Before he left though, Clooney fought for and got a pediatric ER approved, with himself as the attending. His relationship with nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) continued to grow stronger, as the two planned their future together. As the season drew to a close, Hathaway discovered she was pregnant with his twins, but when she told him the news, he couldn't return, leaving her to face the pregnancy alone. Greene got a good dose of being a manager, as he and Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) managed to work the ER through a number of problems. Greene also dealt with his wife being remarried and his daughter having to live far away. He does get to spend some time with her early in the season. He also treats a hospital janitor (guest star Djimon Hounsou)with a horrible history of abuse and helps him to overcome his fears and confront everything going on in his life. Greene also strikes up a friendship with British surgeon Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston) and as the season ends they begin a relationship that would eventually lead to their marriage. Corday begins her second year in Chicago starting over as an intern. When she turns down Dr. Romano's (guest star and future regular Paul McCrane) advances, he cancels her fellowship and she is forced to start over again. Her relationship with Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle) eventually ends and as the year comes to a close, in addition to her relationship with Greene, she is going back to Romano looking for another fellowship to extend her stay in Chicago. Dr. Weaver begins a search for her birth mother, a search that leads her to someone who isn't her mother thanks to a private investigator. She applies for the job as head of the ER, but is passed over in favor of Dr. Amanda Lee (guest star Mare Winningham), who turns out to actually not be a doctor at all. After the Dr. Lee fiasco, Weaver doesn't put her name back in an the temporary reins are turned over to Dr. Romano, much to the disdain of the entire ER staff. PA Jeannie Boulet, already positive for HIV, comes down with Hepatitis C and is also involved in a car accident with Ross, which puts her in the hospital for a while. She also is a key part of the pediatric ER with Ross. Hathaway, as mentioned, continues to grow in her relationship with Ross. She also opens a clinic in the ER, catering to the poor of the area. Her clinic is a great success until she is forced to step down after Ross uses her and the clinic to get the machine that ultimately kills his final patient. The season ends as she begins what will be one of her finest arcs on the show, her pregnancy with twins. The storyline is also one that will eventually introduce viewers to Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) who is now a regular on the show. Benton continues to deal with his son's deafness, going to great lengths to learn all he can. He is hurt when he learns that his son's mother is moving to Germany with her new husband and basically kidnaps his son in the season's final episode. Benton also had a "highlight" episode in the season, as he journeyed to Mississippi to fill in at a doctor's office there and had to deal with the racial tensions and also had to find his bedside manner, as he stepped away from being a surgeon for two weeks. Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) had an interesting year. He began the year as an RA in the medical students' dorm, but lost his job when the students threw a party that resulted in an overdose. He eventually moved into Weaver's basement. He also has a relationship with insurance saleswoman Roxanne (guest star Julie Bowen), but breaks that off in the final few episodes of the season. His tryst with his medical student Lucy Knight (the oh-so-adorable Kellie Martin) is a highlight of the season, although it only happened in one episode. Knight is the new kid on the block in this season, the eager medical student with a good brain, but a lack of actual skills. She and Carter seem to have a love-hate relationship that comes to full tilt when she accidently kicks him in the chest and helps nurse him back to health. The highlight of this season was the two-part episode "The Storm," possibly the best two-part episode the show has ever done. In the episode, Jeannie and Doug get in a car accident on the way to help at a horrific accident involving a school bus, where Dr. Greene is a hero for saving the kids. Additionally, Carter and Knight have their tryst in one of the hospital's rooms and eventually Ross calls it quits. The two hours were filled with great drama and it is truly a highlight in ER's run. The only thing lacking on this set is extras. There are a lot of deleted scenes and a great gag reel, but no commentaries or other extras. That is a little disappointing. I enjoy getting whatever access I can to my absolute favorite television show and this set doesn't provide anything substantial to that regard. Despite that, this was a great season, truly one of the best they did. The cast was able to move past Clooney's departure and pull together in the final few episodes. All in all, a fine effort for one of television's best dramas 
It's a good season worth owning. I assume you already know this if you are reading this. The DVD set is presented with good sound, picture quality etc.....however.... I was really disappointed to see that Warner Bros. cheaped out on the English subtitles this time around. Seasons 2-4 were awesome to watch with the subtitles for the hard of hearing, as it really helped with the comprehension of all the medical jargon that was being spewed out at 100 miles an hour. As a medical professional myself, I got a lot out of this "special" feature. My fiancee, who is NOT a medical professional, found that she was able to get a lot more out of the show by watching the subtitles as well. It definitely helps a viewer appreciate the complexity of the show's writing. The show is still great. However, it is inexplicable why we had to wait 7 months for this DVD set to come out when they obviously didn't put as much work into it as the previous sets (ie. they didn't want to pay someone to transcribe the scripts and sync subtitles). This is especially irksome considering that season 5 has been available on DVD in the UK for quite a long while now. I had just assumed Warner Bros. was spending the extra time and cash to do the job right for North America. I was wrong 
While the first four seasons of ER were superb, season 5 takes it up a notch. This is mostly due to the addition of possibley the greatest ER character ever, Lucy Knight. The relationship between her and Carter has been the best (almost) coupling in the shows history. The departure of Doug Ross was devastating, and emotional. The rest of the cast were terrific as well. Greene, Benton, Corday, even Romano gave amazing performances every time. It's just a shame that not every season can be as memorable as Season 5 was. The dvd should be great. I'll be first in line to buy it 
I ask again, why is it that the series is filmed in the US produced in the US etc. and yet the UK is already selling series 6 which was released in April 2006. Season 5 was realeased last year. You all say you are so excited that the season is about to be released where those fans in the UK are feeling sorry for you because they are ahead yet again. I suggest buying a multi-regional DVD player and buy the seasons from else where aroung the world as they seem to be more with it and up-to-date 
Finally....ER Season 5 is here. I have been checking here like every week waiting on this season to come out. I have never watched ER until my recent deployment to Iraq. I went through the first 4 seasons in like 2.5 months. And I know if those were really good, then season 5 is going to even better. 
It's finally here! The complete fifth season of ER is coming to dvd! Season five is one of the most intense seasons of ER period! Kellie Martin joins the cast as Carter's med student, Lucy Knight. Also, Doug Ross (Georege Clooney) leaves the show in a riveting two parter. Jeanie's condition worsens, Benton realizes his son is deaf, and at the end of the season, Hathaway finds out she is carrying twins. That is just the tip of the iceberg of what happens in ER: SEASON 5 This is a must for any fan. Also, I would like to correct a careless mistake made by amazon.com The cast members they have listed at the top of the page are not in this season, most of them didn't even come in until the ninth or tenth season. The entire fifth season cast is: Anthony Edwards George Clooney Noah Wyle Julianna Margulies Gloria Rueben Laura Innes Alex Kingston Kellie Martin and Eriq La Salle As for the cast members listed at the top of the page, here are the seasons they came in: Goran Visnjic: season 6 Maura Tierney: season 6 Mekhi Phifer: season 9, recurring previously in season 8 Parminder Nagra: season 10 Linda Cardellini: season 10 There have been many other cast members on the show since season five, but these are the ones mistakenly listed by amazon as being on the fifth season. This season won at least one emmy, if not more, and earned even more nominations including one for Noah Wyle. Patient story lines include an a man who has strapped a bomb to himself, a girl who needs a transfusion of a rare blood type, a man dressed as an elf who has a heart arrythmia, a school bus accident, a shot stripper and a DUI victim. This set also includes the emmy winning two parter The Storm, which is the departure of George Clooney's charachter. It was watched by over 40 million people when it first aired. This is one of ER's best seasons, although I have to say they are all great, except for the eleventh season. Oh well, at least it got back to being good again for the twelth season. Keep em coming Warner Brothers! 
Kathy Ireland gives you a quick warm up, 12 minutes of abs, 12 minutes of buttocks, and 12 minutes of thigh work. There's a countdown clock for each workout. During each workout, Kathy has you switch exercises every 45 seconds, which I think is great. No annoying rep-counting, and you can focus on working it hard and getting the burn because you know it will be over soon! Most of the ab work is based on the traditional crunch, but Kathy uses enough variations to keep it fun -- and deady effective. I'm feeling this one DAYS later. The buns work involves some squats, some leg-lifting stuff, and a little floorwork, and it's pretty effective too. Though as always, you get out of it what you put into it. The greatest aspect of the video for me, though, is the congenial atmosphere. Kathy seems so sweet, and her workout crew -- two guys, a girl, and Kathy's mom -- are nice companions for the workout. The guys will keep you giggling. They keep saying goofy stuff like "This one hurts." or "I'm gonna eat a big steak tonight." Kathy is a good M.C. and motivator, and she has a nice way of gracefully humoring those goofy guys. In this aspect, it's the most FUN I've ever had while doing a workout video. It captures the positive social aspects of working out in a class setting, but you get all the convenience and privacy of working out at home. The VHS version is called Kathy Ireland: Body Specifics. This DVD has the same workouts, but it sure is nice to just select the workout you want from the menu instead of fast forwarding and rewinding all the time 
.... this time I was pleasantly surprised. Love the short sections as I get bored very easily. Can't believe how quickly the thigh section went when I did it either !!! Kathy Ireland seems like a really sweet girl and her body is certainly an inspiration to me as I huff and puff on the floor. I will be buying more. Thanks Kathy. It's so lovely to find a DVD that I feel like I can work through without getting lost 
I had two of the three sections on VHS. Now I own them on DVD and I love to exercise the target areas in less time. I am a full time student and mother of three so exercising is at a minimum 
The funniest show ever. Enough said 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT's rocky history is well known. Loved by critics and its fans, it fought to find an audience, and its final season was a short affair. However, the ride from the shows premier (included uncensored and expanded along with the aired version) to its conclusion (and, YES, it has a conclusion) is hilarious and worth many returns. There are so many jokes and resonating gags that multiple viewings are REQUIRED, but your first visit to the world of the spoiled Buth family will be a reward for unfamiliar viewers. Here are three seasons of laughs. The series begins with the arrest of the Bluth patriarch and continues as the clan's only responsible memeber, Michael (portrayed by Jason Bateman), tries to keep the family's business afloat while his mother, siblings, and other family members selfishly grab for every freebie and dollar. His mother, Lucille, is a cold, controlling alcoholic whose loyalty to her family keeps her one step from pure villainy. His siblings include an older brother, Gob, a magician (of little skill), a younger brother, Buster, a mama's boy who eventually loses a body part to a nasty seal, and a sister whose marriage is ... complicated. Throw in a long-suffering son infatuated with his cousin and an uncle who is the twin of his father, and you can see how complicated Michael's life becomes. Not your average family, not your average TV comedy (this is NOT a sitcom performed live in front of a studio audience but is filmed more like a documentary with the camera floating around like an unseen voyeur -- think the old comedy series SOAP updated a la THE OFFICE. The jokes come fast and furious. It's all absurd and incredibly entertaining. For the record, the series is presented widescreen, and there are deleted scenes and audio commentaries for selected episodes. To tell you the truth, I haven't even skimmed these extras, but I have watched the series in its entirety far too many times to disclose without embarrassing myself. It's too bad that ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT didn't achieve the ratings necessary to keep it afloat, but it has more laughs than comedies that lasted twice as long 
This 3 disc box set by Criterion contains three of Jean Renoir's color films made in the 1950's. The first film is "The Golden Coach" known in France as "Le carrousee d'or" it is the story of Spanish colonists in Central America. The film is intended as a comedy and contains some fine scenes. It is very well written and the Vivaldi score is great also. The film is in English which is rare for French films. The second film is "French Cancan" which was previously released in the US as "Only the French Can" It depicts the grand opening of the world famous French nightclub, Moulin Rouge. The film has great acting and appearencec by some famous performers including the great French singer Edith Piaf. As anyone could expect, the film contains Offenbach's "Orpheus in the Underworld" in the score and an excellent finale scene of women dancing the cancan. I think that the film is one of finest examples of French cinema depicting the performing arts. The third film, "Elena and her Men" known in France as "Elna et les hommes" is the story of a princess from Poland who is very attractive to the men around her. Some of the elite class begin to fight over her resulting in the instability of French society. The film has an excellent performance by Ingrid Bergman as the princess and has some fine scenery. Each disc includes special features some of which are very good. Disc 1 contains "The Golden Coach" with seperate introductions to the film by Jean Renoir and Martin Scorsesse, production stills and the first part of a three part interview with Jean Renoir originally set for French television. Disc 2 contains "French Cancan" with an introduction by Peter Bogdanovich, the 2nd part of the afforementioned 3 part interview, production stills and an interview with set designer Max Douy. Disc 3 contains "Elena and her Men" along with an introduction by Renior, production stills, the 3rd part of the interview and the second half of a 1990's British TV documentary on Renior. This box set is a very fine collection of Renoir's films and a must buy for Renoir fans 
The three color films that mark Jean Renoir's return to Europe might be surprising compared to his classics 30's films like RULES OF THE GAME, LA BETE HUMAINE, TONI or GRAND ILLUSION, with which Renoir became prominent as a master of realism. For instance, always preferring to shoot on location rather than in studio environments (TONI was one of the first major sound motion picture to be entrely shot on location with direct sound recording; a revolution at the time). THE GOLDEN COACH, FRENCH CANCAN and ELENA AND HER MEN are deliberately artificial, stylized, and burlesque. Note for instance the framings in THE GOLDEN COACH, in which Claude Renoir's camera is consciously and carefully placed to achieve symmetrical compositions. In comparison to the moving camera techniques of GRAND ILLUSION and RULES OF THE GAME that allowed him to capture the actions without missing the many crucial details in one, continuous long take, these three films (especially COACH and ELENA) may look very static. The acting style is also very much over the top. One of the supplements, the Jacques Rivette's interview, in which Renoir repeatingly insists that "truth" or "reality" can be only achieved through artifice and artifacts of the artistic medium, is extremely revealing about Renoir's changing his style, and that though the apparent style has changed, his philosophy about filmmaking is remarkably consistent. These three films are also created as comedies, though the contents are some of the most serious themes treated in cinema, and have a lot to do with cinema itself as a performing/representational art form. For each of the three films is profound analysis about performing in human life. FRENCH CANCAN is about the nature of performers, and the difficulties of that profession. THE GOLDEN COACH and ELENA AND HER MEN are, among other things, political farces, based on the extremely cynical idea that politics are nothing else but a matter of performance. Arguably, only Renoir could depict those themes as light-hearted comedies. Some notes should be made on the transfers of this new DVD edition. ELENA was shot with Eastmancolor film stock (one strip negative), and the transfer is created from the original negative. Excepts for optically-treated segments (dissolves and fade outs, fade ins) which show severe color fading, the DVD represents very much what the film should look like. And those color fadings are practically impossible to fix with today's technology. THE GOLDEN COACH and FRENCH CANCAN were originally shot with 3-strips Technicolor cameras. This system requires 3 B/W negatives running simultaneously, each of them recording one primary color. So it is impossible to just scan the original negatives to get the most faithful images. The DVD transfers for these 2 films are created from interpositives. For FRENCH CANCAN, it seems that a vintage dye-transfer print was used, and though it shows certain damages caused by age, the DVD represents faithfully the texture and details such as the material quality of the clothings that can be only captured on a dye-transfer Technicolor print, as well as the rather pale, pastel-like color palette that Renoir and art director Max Douy intended to depict the period: the story takes place in the heights of impressionism paintings. For THE GOLDEN COACH, the print used for the transfer is probably from the restoration and re-release in the early 90's (Martin Scorsese financed the American distribution; hence his introduction on the DVD). This restoration was important since before that, the film was virtually invisible, but nevertheless not a perfect one technically speaking. It does not have the richness of color of a dye-transfer Technicolor prints, particularly the reds and the blacks suffer a lot. Plus, certain shots, especially the extremely moving and revealing epilogue in which Renoir confesses through Camilla-Anna Magnani the sadness of working in performing arts, suffer a lot from the different shrinkage of each color-separation negatives. The colors are nearly dead, and they look out of focus. It's a pity that unlike the American studio's Technicolor classics with which a lot of financial and technical efforts are constantly made to put them back into shape, THE GOLDEN COACH, one of the greatest masterpieces of this color-format, is not yet properly restored. Criterion has already put GRAND ILLUSION and RULES OF THE GAME on market with beautiful DVD editions. Now, watching this new DVD sets, and especially watching the supplement BBC documentary about Renoir's career after the 40's, I must say that now they have to publish Renoir's first color film THE RIVER, which is one of the less-known masterpiece of Renoir's as well as a key film for the evolution of his style, on a DVD edition as accomplished as these 
French Cancan: Renoir's theme is love, in all its frightening vibrancy, and I still sit amazed as I watch the first 45 minutes of this film as the film's great leitmotives, desire and jealousy, wash like waves one after the other through the characters and through my own limbs. Renoir shows us Love, the force of nature that will not be contained, gathering strength and finally erupting through the story like a hurricane, overwhelming all who wish to control it, and leaving in its path destruction and pain, but also creation, beauty, joy and life. In spirit, French Cancan is most like Jean's memoir of his father, and one feels oneself in the presence of Auguste here more than in any other of Jean's films. Elena et les Hommes: Politics as Show Business Made at the time that Jean was producing and writing plays for the theatre, these three films all have in common a preoccupation with the theatrical nature of life. Shakespeare's insight that all the world is a stage receives fresh treatment in Elena et les Hommes as the film contemplates the theatrical nature of politics and worldly ambition. Politics is just another kind of show business, Renoir is telling us. The film usually disconcerts viewers with its mixture of theatrical styles. Ingrid Bergman, fresh off five films with Rossellini, leads an excellent cast of actors that play in a naturalistic style, while the setting and the supporting cast are pure burlesque. This interplay of styles, perhaps more at home in the theatre, creates moments of compelling realism, on the one hand, against a background of farce, on the other. Perhaps also frustrating to viewers is the way that the film refuses to become a conventional love story, despite the presence of established romantic leads, gorgeous costumes and sets, Technicolor and a beautiful score. Rather than go to Hollywood for character types, Renoir appears to have gone to Ancient Greece. Each of the men pursuing Elena recalls Plato's anecdote about the three types of men who go to the Olympic games. Some go to compete for fame. Some go to sell and make money. And others, of a more philosophical nature, go to observe. The film also contains several nods to Rossellini's Viaggio in Italia, including the way Ingrid is carried along the street by joyful crowds, the miraculous "love the magician" ending, and the presence of an uncompromising realism that often violates Hollywood-type standards of taste. Witness the scene after the parade which begins as a charming Hollywood-style romantic encounter between Ingrid and Mel Ferrer, and then leads to a moment when Ingrid, having had too much to drink, no longer knows what she is doing and ends up making out in a bar full of people with a man she has just met. Ingrid Bergman of all people! And here we see how, with respect to an uncompromising realism and the limits imposed upon it by conventional standards of taste, Renoir, Rossellini and Stroheim were all members of the same school, despite varying surface appearances. "Take a close look at the world, keep on doing so, and in the end it will lay bare for you its.......what?" 
GOLDEN COACH (1953) - 9/10 Golden Coach is the first film of a loosely put together trilogy with themes of love and life on the stage made by Jean Renoir. This film is also a salutation to the French people as Renoir returns to to France after having fled during World War II and trying to make it in Hollywood. However, Renoir had much difficulty dealing with influential movie producers in Hollywood as they often kept Renoir under strict supervision. This supervision made Renoir feel somewhat strangled when it cames to artistic freedom, which is also expressed in this trilogy. The Golden Coach takes place in 18th century Peru where the Spanish viceroy of Peru has purchased a golden coach from Italy in order to symbolically display the might of the colony. A small Italian theater troupe trails the Golden Coach as they voyage on the same ship across the Atlantic to the new world. When the theater troupe arrives to the town where they have been promised a job with several luxuries they find a pitiful small town with no commodities as promised in the employment letter. Deprived of hope they begin to build a small stage where they can perform and maybe earn enough to return to Europe. The theater troupes unspoken star is Camilla (Anna Magnani) whom most men find delicately alluring as her mere presence absorbs all the attention from the audience as she flourish on the stage. Camilla's charisma attracts three prominent men's attention as all three fall in love with her. The protective Spanish soldier, Felipe (Paul Campbell), traveled with her across the Atlantic as he tries to charm her and win her over. The fiery and infamous toreador Ramon (Riccardo Rioli) who has been spellbound by Camilla's stage performance tries to sway her into marriage. Lastly, the Spanish viceroy Ferdinand (Duncan Lamont) is drawn to her as he finds himself being prepared to give up the Golden Coach to her. Felipe, Ramon, and Ferdinand find themselves in trouble as they are all attracted to Camilla who never will belong to one of them as she loves the stage. Jean Renoir hired a small Italian family circus to perform in the film as the theater troupe. The only film actor in the theater troupe is Anna Magnani who performs brilliantly as Renoir entirely built the film around her. The film becomes a tribute to Italian theater as much of the film surrounds theater and the mise-en-scene is symbolically a theater set. However, the strongest tribute to theater comes through Camilla's love for the stage and the audience's love for her. Renoir was also influenced by Vivaldi's music which inspired the script's Italian zest, which offers a terrific cinematic experience that is both witty, warm, and full of valuable lessons. FRENCH CANCAN (1955) - 9/10 The second part of Jean Renoir trilogy about the love for the stage is a colorful story about the vaudeville manager Henri Danglard (Jean Gabin) and his rejuvenation of an old frolicsome dance called the cancan. Danglard is more of an artist than a manager as his ultimate goal is self-expression, which he projects to the audience through the performances of a large number of artists. These artist have all been discovered through Danglard's incredible instincts to find talent among ordinary people and turn them into celebrities over night. The skillful Danglard also loves the critical audience as he seeks their approval through a violent flow of applause. The story begins in successful cafe, Le Paravent Chinois, with vaudeville performances that heavily depend on Lola de Castro's (Mara Flix) performance. Lola is also Danglard's mistress, but what the audience does not know is that Danglard spends every penny to improve the show in order to conquer the audience's approval. This leads Le Paravent Chinois into bankruptcy, but it does not bother Danglard as he is aware of the existing financial potential in Paris. This means that Danglard is self-assured in that he will find another sponsor for his new project, which is the French Cancan. The quest for the French Cancan becomes a difficult struggle as Danglard must face jealous mistresses and boyfriends, physical harm, and much more. However, this does not prevent Danglard to continue to strive to create his final masterpiece, which will become the initiation of the Moulin Rouge. Jean Renoir's French Cancan becomes a root for self-expression as he nose dives into his own artistic talent where he uses the cancan dance as an allegory for self-expressive freedom and artistic originality. The film also became a reunion between two cinematic titans, Gabin and Renoir, as they made some brilliant films together almost two decades ago. Gabin becomes Renoir's alter ego in this cinematic event as he displays Renoir's love for the arts through rejuvenation of the cancan. It should be mentioned that Gabin was personally offended by Renoir's escape to United States during World War II and his delayed return to France after the war. Nonetheless, these two men came together and created a brilliant cinematic experience that honors the arts and stage performances. ELENA AND HER MEN (1956) - 8/10 Elena and Her Men is the final film in Renoir's trilogy of stage performances. This is a light-hearted film with serious undertones loosely based on General Georges Boulanger's attempt to reverse the popularity of the Republic in France with his own popularity in the 1880s. The history books reveal the truth of General Georges Boulanger's failed coup as he was strongly supported by Orleanist and Bonapartist princes. In this story, General Georges Boulanger is renamed General Rollan (Jean Marais), but the story is focused on the main character Elena (Ingrid Bergman). The liberal Polish Princess Elena seeks to change the world for the better by her standards by inspiring men to pursue their dreams and urge them to seek a higher calling. In the initial scene it becomes apparent that Elena has already succeeded once as a composer and has received an immense career boost through Elena's' encouragement, but the composer's marriage proposal is declined by the self-reliant Elena. Elena's independence and liberal mind is noticeable as she mingles on the crowded streets of Paris as the people celebrate General Rollan's return from a successful campaign. Elena is strongly affected by the people's cheers for General Rollan as she begins to pursue a way to meet General Rollan. When they meet it is obvious that General Rollan has strong affections for Elena, which will play a large part in the films outcome. Film viewers that have seen other films by Jean Renoir will easily detect the mise-en-scene as it reproduces a staged atmosphere, which produces theater atmosphere. Nonetheless, it will not ruin the film as Renoir tells an intelligent story with different plots and schemes as he also did in Rules of the Game (1939), which has several similarities with Elena and Her Men. These different plots are all told in a delicate satirical light as they convey a serious message that will offer much thought for the viewers that engage themselves in Elena and Her Men. CRITERION Criterion does a stunningly skillful work to put these three films together in a box that symbolically matches the colors presented in the films. Any film enthusiast will recognize the good work done by the Criterion Company. Lastly, the additional information on the DVDs will further the cinematic education of the audience. 
I just saw French Can Can minutes ago, and after seeing it I can honestly say purchasing the set was worth it. Orson Welles was once asked to name his three favoite directors, to which he responded John Ford, John Ford and John Ford. After seing French Can Can, I respond (for myself) Jean Renoir, Jean Renoir and Jean Renoir. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard, I loved a picture so much and cried so much and so hard... Well, no, that's noy quite fair, I can remember the last time I felt all those things, It was after seing Grand Illusion... by Jean Renoir! It's heartbreakingly beautiful 
Early this year, Criterion issued the definitive DVD of Jean Renoir's 1939 classic "The Rules of the Game." Now, the label lightens up with "Stage and Spectacle," a boxed set that makes a trilogy out of the splashy Technicolor films Renoir made upon returning to Europe in the mid-1950s. Renoir was in a mood to party. He'd survived an unhappy decade exiled in the Hollywood studio system. The director felt liberated, much like his homeland, France. And so we have two bawdy celebrations of life and theater: "The Golden Coach," starring life force Anna Magnani (1953), and "French Cancan," a snappy and wise backstage comedy (1955). "Elena and Her Men" (1956) exudes romance with Ingrid Bergman as a savvy and desirable Polish princess toying with French politics. Plots are thin; spirits are high. All of the films are filled with boisterous, dizzying crowd scenes. "The frames remind me of his father's paintings," Martin Scorsese says in an introduction to "Coach." "It's like standing in the presence of a great fresco and being overwhelmed. ... The use of color is extraordinary." Alas, Renoir's palette has withered. All of these (restored) films show their age. Witness the sustained flashing in "Coach," abrupt shifts in color tone in "Elena" and the oddly bleached-out scenes in "Cancan." But making allowances, the visuals remain magnificent, memorable. The films are all full frame. Mono audio is bright and serviceable. Renoir, who died in 1979, loved talking about his work. Clips of him are featured throughout the DVD set. The filmmaker sits with new wave director Jacques Rivette for a subtitled interview -- a monologue, really -- that's spread across the three DVDs. It's a terrific but long-winded lecture on the craft of filmmaking. The BBC documentary on Renoir's career that began on "The Rules of the Game" DVD continues here, covering mostly the director's Hollywood years under the thumb of Darryl F. Zanuck and other studio chiefs. The making of the three joyous films found in this set serves as a happy ending, of sorts 
The DVD for "The Golden Coach" is for the most part fine, but the final minutes, which are crucial to the full impact of the film, are ruined by deplorable mastering. The scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening. I believe Criterion made some kind of mastering error, because Martin Scorsese's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film. Criterion should withdraw the DVD and offer a replacement 
French Cancan, one of three Renoir films packaged by Criterion as Stage and Spectacle, is a marvelous movie. The story is simple but the execution is amazing. A Belle Epoque impresario, down on his financial luck, is going to open a new club, the Moulin Rouge, with a new dance, the French cancan. He encounters a working girl and makes her a dancer. She'll become a star. There are several crises to overcome before that happens. The movie is Jean Renoir's tribute to show business, and he puts it on the screen with color, verve, humor, and humanity. There are wonderful performances by all the actors. The leads are Jean Gabin as Henri Danglard, the impresario; Francoise Arnoul as Nini, the girl who'll become a star; and Maria Felix as Lola de Castro, an overwhelmingly tempestuous beauty and Danglard's lover at the start. Gabin exudes confidence, worldly humor and dedication to show business. He even dances a bit. Arnoul is first rate, too. It looks like she was doing her own dances, and as an actress think of a young Leslie Caron with brains and charm. The climax of the movie is the opening of the club, with Felix's star dance, comic songs, a whistler, a Danglar-discovered singer, all moving toward the introduction of the French cancan. The crises happen and are resolved. Then the cancan explodes. Dancing girls come bursting out from the stage, the front of the theater, through posters, down ropes from the balcony. The house swirls with the black tie and tails of the swells and the garish colors of the dancers' gowns. The cancan number lasts probably ten or fifteen minutes or so, all music and gaiety, all high kicks and splits. It's amazing when row after row of the dancers, moving toward the camera through the audience, leap up, legs extended straight foward and backward, backs arched, then land on the dance floor in full splits. I didn't know whether to shout or wince. The last scene of the movie is outside the club, shot from the cobblestone street looking at the entrance. It's a medium shot and from the side street a happy, inebriated fellow in black tie and top hat staggers across, pauses to tip his hat at the camera, then staggers off. A completely charming ending. This really is a marvelous movie. Peter Bogdanovich has a good filmed interview. He usually puts me off with the ego, the ascot and the dyed hair. But he does know movies, and his insights into Renoir and this movie are good. There are several extras, and the DVD transfer is first rate. --- The Golden Coach: What a charming movie. I started smiling at the opening curtain and the good feeling lasted to the end. The dialogue is often amusingly worldly with an epigrammatic style. The look of the movie is so lush and theatrical. And Anna Magnani is a powerhouse as Camilla. One critic said that watching one after the other of The Golden Coach, French Cancan and Elena and Her Men, the three movies in the Criterion Renoir pack, would create a sensory overload. He's right, I think. But taking each at a leisurely pace is proving very rewarding. The theater is life, Renoir says, and he's proving it in these three movies. 
PBS did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together. It covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films. The documentary includes many interview pieces with Kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like. Also, there are comments from noted Japanese film historian Donald Richie. As a Kurosawa fan watching this on PBS when it aired, the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour. It is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century 
I saw this on PBS' Great Performances. This documentary is about film genius Akira Kurosawa. The documentary charts Akira Kurosawa's early life in pre-WWII Japan to the end of his life. Kurosawa brought Japanese cinema to a world wide audience. I recommend this DVD for anyone who is a Akira Kurosawa fan. Plus the DVD has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the PBS program and Kurosawa filmography 
Putting it simply, this film is the work of a genius. As a Tom Stoppard fanatic, I adored it from the moment I read the play, which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with. He was significantly more satisfied with the movie, and there is very little doubt as to why. He clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working. Any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film--they may or may not like it, but that's not what matters. This film is amazing 
Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring. It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally. I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me. I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better. My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing. Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
A little Cerebral and a little slapstick, and all Shakespeare. It is how Shakespeare would have written the story of Hamlets friends 
This is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something. But those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most under-rated films of all time. There isn't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the movie-going crowd, but it has some of the best acting (serious and comic) writing imagery of any film you're likely to come across 
I have to admit this movie can be slow and strange. Hence minus 1 star. But TO ME, and this is just to ME, I was able to pay attention because of Gary Oldman, who is my all time #1 favorite actor. He's such a chameleon, and seeing as how he usually graces the screen as a bad guy in some way, shape, or form (or is just eccentric or crazy lol), he's just brilliantly funny in this. It's interesting b/c Gary's character as 'Rosencrantz' (NOT Guildenstern lol) is a 'slow' fella but he's imaginative inventive, but philosophical once he gets a grasp on what you're talking about. Then to top it all off, you're thrust into HAMLET, but from another perspective. So you gotta get into the Shakespearian linguo, which I haven't done fully since 12th grade, and that was 6 years ago. Fortunately, Ros Guild hardly have to talk in such a strange manner or AS THICKLY as the other regular HAMLET characters do. It's just worded strangely b/c it's like they're poets. The chemistry between Roth Oldman is wonderful, and the extra's are interviews with Dreyfus, Oldman, Roth, Stoppard himself. Then they also have a photo gallery. That's it, but for me it was enough to hear Oldman talk for 58 minutes! :) (They're interviewed separately.) The dvd I got came with 2 discs, I suppose this is the only release to DVD so far so they all will be 2 disc? Quality was very good. :) If you're a big fan of Gary's, I HIGHLY recommend this flick. Very amusing, and interesting, and good Shakespearian fun : 
This is a work of genius. It is creative, original, funny and well done. That being said, it is probably not for everyone. This wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from Shakespeare's HAMLET. These are the stars of the show. In Hamlet, they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with Hamlet's melancholia. They appear briefly and are gone. The last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. They are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince. In this work, the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them. The spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them. As they discuss existential questions, the tragedy of Hamlet plays out around them. It is quite funny but some background helps. It helps a great deal if you are comfortable with Elizabethan speech. Whole pieces are lifted from Shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style. It helps if you are familiar with Hamlet. That makes understanding the context easier. It is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics. Rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn. It's is fun. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it would be an excellent addition to any library where one would find other film adaptations of Shakespeares works. It does help to have an idea of Hamlet, and I would recommend reading or watching any version of it before this film or you can get a bit lost. It gives a new spin to the play and makes you see the play through the eyes of two of the minor players, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. However, it is nonetheless an enjoyable film and will only add to your enjoyment and understanding of Hamlet. 
Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
I saw this with a group of Strangers with Candy fans, and everybody was pretty disappointed. Each scene of the series was overflowing with humorous touches - the film is strangely sedate. At the same time, a ton of jokes are lifted straight from the television show. The things they don't lift are missed - why did they swap Gerri's manically comatose father for Dan Hedaya laying peacefully in bed 
I have to disagree with the other reviewers. I enjoyed the series, and probably saw most of the episodes, but this wasn't worth the time. 
After taking several years off - the cult hit tv show, strangers with candy returns in all its un-pc glory. Most of the original crew are represented which was a feat unto itself. The original tv show was maybe the funniest show ever. The characters and dialogue are so well done, and with little fanfare.Through an almost underground following we have this last episode in the life and times of Jerry Blank. This movie does not disappoint there are so many funny lines in this it does the show justice. Onyx Blackman is back in trouble with his gambling addiction and needs to show the school board that he can produce intelligent students. Meanwhile Jerry Blank has just enrolled after a 32 year prison sentence to further complicate his goal. Science teacher turned religous man- Chuck Noblet is at his best in this one. He must decide whether his new found religous beliefs are more important to him than his love for the flamboyant art teacher Geoffrey Jellineck. So many great moments when Chuck teaches his class( eyes to the back of the room). There is even a celebrity couple who play roles in this one. If you have seen the original series then what are you waiting for? And if you are new to this series, you may want to watch some of the dvds from the original seasons to brush up on it a bit. They add some background to some of the humor and jokes. Part of what makes a show so good in your mind is the fact that it ended before it should have and thats just what happened to Strangers with candy. This movie is for the true fans who got it and needed one more for the road. 
Strangers with Candy (the movie) is pretty funny. In fact, it is funnier than most major comedy releases but maybe not as funny as the TV series that spawned it. Problem is the same as for X-Files (the movie), rather than changing the game plan (Coneheads) for the new arena they went with their usual formula that gets watered down on the big screen.  That being said, in my worthless opinion, Amy Sedaris is the funniest woman in the world and it was wonderful and wonderfully funny to see so many of the original members reunited. One other problem may have been that on the series they would set-up several shots to tell a joke and didn't have that liberty in the movie, as it cost so much more. Another may have been with Paul Dinello directing the movie he shortchanged his role as Jellineck. Still, Strangers will be hysterical for any ardent fan but not sure it's the best introduction for a newcomer as Strangers with Candy, like a fine wine, is an acquired taste. 
Out of prison unleashed on Flatpoint once again, for the first time. A prequel to the best politically incorrect TV comedy perhaps ever (at least besides All In the Family). Laughs galore as Jerri tries to adjust to life outside the harsh penal system. It is not easy, especially for everyone inside Jerri's "chow zone". You may take a beating or perhaps loose a finger, but Jerri is loyal to her bitches. If anyone messes with her friends, she'll stick 'em with a shive in the showers. Violent slapstick, vulgar sexual content and other delights await 
Hey I'd just like to say that I'm one of the kids in the video and its great to read all the good feedback on the video. I'm glad you guys like it because we put a lot of time and effort into making it. CrazyLegs and Robin are two of the best Hip-Hop teachers in New York and it was great to have them collaborate on this video for the public. Thanks again 
I got this video for my 5 1/2 yr old to begin to get some experience in "party" dancing. The moves are very easy to follow. She loves the video, as does her younger 3 1/2 yr old sister. They have watched it 5 or 6 times now and still love it. While the oldest is not a master of the moves yet, it is exactly what I was looking for. It is a video that introduces her to some dance steps, while encouraging her to create her own. It allows her to have fun (not sit in front of the TV) and learn some dance moves at the same time. I would expect that if she continues to watch the video that it would help her get some confidence and be able to dance. Although the video is not necessarily for 5 year olds, she is able to "try" the moves and should be able to get them down after practicing. I think this video has "staying power" -- they will use it for a few years. I would recommend this for someone looking for a basic dance video. It is good for 5 year olds on up to early teens. (My husband and I were even trying out some moves!) Keep in mind it is hip hop, not the waltz. It is good for kids learning to dance with other kids. And I agree with another reviewer, I was pleased that it is not too racy for childen -- it is in quite good taste. After they get the moves down, I will try the Hip Hop Shop 2 
This got my 5-yr old nephew up and dancing when another vid didn't. Decent instruction, I thought. Was worried that it might be too racy/inappropriate for his dad's taste, but seemed fine. Happy with the purchase 
We just got the DVD about a week ago and my kids love it! My boys love videos and dancing and this was perfect for them. They are 10 and 5 and both were able to do all the steps after the first 2 viewings. My 2 year old daughter even gets up and does some of the easier moves with them!!! FUN, EASY and GREAT EXERCISE!!! I've done the tape with them and it's an awesome workout that the whole family can have fun doing together! Much better than sitting in front of the T.V. or playing video games all day!!! :))) 
This is a great dance VHS or DVD for kids that want to learn some updated dance moves. The format is NOT boring. The music is "clean" and the presentation is very upbeat and fun! My 10 yr. old and her friends LOVE this video!!! I highly recommend this video as a very good buy 
I read the statement: Will send in two to three business days. It's been almost one month. I never received the video. I'm not happy 
I was very happy with Getting Strangers with candy from this merchant. It was a good deal on a product that is often hard to come by (many merchants were selling the seperate seasons for the cost I bought the total series). And there were bonus features on top of it, I also like the mock note pad packaging. And besides all that, I got my shipment early. So all in all I'm quite happy 
This material is classic! The cast is classic and I had to have it as a complete series to watch over and over. Brilliant comedy! ; 
Nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent. Every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even William Shatner would envy, and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical. As anybody who has seen this show knows, the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into double-entendre and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for British comedy. (Although, as "children" of the Three Stooges, Americans are, I think, accustomed to somewhat heavier-handed comedy.) For those who don't know this series, it definitely is too bawdy to watch with kids (I wouldn't let mine watch with me until they are at least 20, by which time they will probably find this material boring). If you are assembling a comedy collection, however, this series fills a unique niche. My only complaint is that the packaging is a bit second rate. It doesn't even come in a box, but rather in a little "accordion-folder" package which is neither aesthetic nor practical (can't stack) nor particularly protective. It is also hard to remove the disks from the center catches without damaging them (I chipped one first thing out of the box despite expecting trouble, but fixed with carefully trimmed packaging tape; works fine) 
THIS SERIES IS FUNNY AND IT REALLY DOES PUSH THE ENVELOPE. I LOVE THE CAST OF CHARACTERS ESPECIALLY JERRY BLANK. AND WHO HASN'T DREAMED (WITH GREAT TERROR!) OF GOING BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL AGAIN? AMY SEDARIS IS WONDERFUL IN THIS SERIES AND SO ARE HER COUNTERPARTS. EVEN THOUGH I WAS LATE IN DICOVERING THIS SHOW I STILL CONSIDER IT TO BE A GEM. I ONLY WISH THEY HAD MADE MORE SEASONS. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT SHOW. 5 STARS. P.S. BUY THIS DVD SET!!!!! IT HAS ALL 3 SEASONS ON IT!!!!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!! LONG LIVE FLATPOINT HIGH!!!!! 
Never really watched the series but saw the movie. Amy S is hilarious. Pushes the envelope on decadence with such a sense of humor! Enjoyable and funny even as you grimace 
Im a huge fan of Strangers with Candy when it was originally on TV and this was a must have. It still is hilarious as it was back then. Being a huge Stephen Colbert fan made this so much fun to watch along with Amy. They are great comics and I wish this had another season. They need to bring this show back 
The series is brilliant. This DVD release is not. Both the original and the replacement that amazon sent me were defective. Scenes would skip, certain episodes would "stick" every few seconds, some episodes and special features wouldn't play at all and would just kick you back to the main menu, and disc 1 on both copies was completely unplayable. (I would get "cannot play disc" errors.) I was afraid that maybe my DVD player was being finicky, but then I bought the first-run, individually released seasons through amazon marketplace sellers and ebay. They play just fine, with no problems. I'm not sure what happened with this release and why there are so many glitches, but my recommendation is to find some copies of the originals and buy those. They're always some used copies floating around on amazon and ebay. Mine are used, and they play great. BTW, you get pretty much the exact same extras and features with the first-run releases, with the exception of maybe a couple of things, so you're not really missing a whole lot. Plus, the boxes are sturdier 
This was a one-of-a-kind series with hilarious supporting characters, and a penchant for the weird. It's a dark comedy that you'd never see on network TV. Amy Sedaris is awful (in a good way), and Stephen Colbert, Paul Dinello, and the rest of the cast is fantastic. Episodes can be uneven, and plotting wasn't exactly the show's strong point, but nonetheless, each episode is filled with great character dynamics, scenes and dialogue. It's one of my favorites. Mar 
For any fan of dark, inappropriate humor, this is the best buy in a long time. The episodes themselves are brilliantly funny, and the extras are even better (if possible). You get a (very long) blooper reel, commentary from Amy, Paul Stephen on 9 of the funniest episodes, an interview with the cast from the Museum of TV and Radio archives, and so much more. The packaging is a bit unusual, but it's less unstable than one would think. A definite, definite purchase 
I have now received 2 copies of this DVD and if you notice there are 3 episodes or more that do not play correctly. My personal favorite is the episode were Jerry is trying to become homecoming queen. It skips a whole chapter... THE WEESLE THE CHICKEN... maybe the best comedy I have ever seen. Please check your copy and see if this happens, it is not the fault of Amazon it is a bad transfer to DVD that needs to be fixed. If you need to see this chapter it will go black screen for a short time after the locker scene, and skip to the next chapter. To see the chapter, go backard 1 chapter. I have had the same problem on all DVD players 
Martin Lawrence is one crazy man. Anything he is or will be in is worth watching 
I hadn't seen this movie in 10 years until this past weekend when it resurfaced on TV -- whew!!! what a welcomed blast from the past. Martin Lawrence was still in his heyday as a comedian in this movie's 1996 release. A sober Bobby Brown delivers an entertaining performance as Martin's pseudo sidekick, Regina King plays a believable "it girl" role and Lynn Whitfield totally delivers an Oscar nomination-worthy performance as a woman scorned and determined to make her man pay for all the heartache that comes from lies and deception. This is one of those twist-of-fate movies for playaz who manipulate relationships just to "get some" and move on. The story is easy to follow. There's tons of subtle but gutbustingly funny scenes. The movie moves along at a great pace -- you won't go to sleep on this! For anyone -- male or female -- who's ever had an "adventure in dating" with a nut you later question why you ever dated, this movie's for you. As the movie's theme song says, "The sweetest woman in the world could (also) be the meanest woman in the world/Did you make her that way?" You're just gonna have to watch this movie to "get it. 
"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate" stars Martin Lawrence, Lynn Whitfield, Regina King, Bobby Brown and Della Reese. This is easily one of my favorite movies; I often watch it when I'm feeling depressed because it eases my mood and reminds me that even though we may face hard times, someone is always going through something worse than you. The movie is a about a player (womanizer) named Darnell who is confident that he can get any woman he wants. He was able to get women easily, because he was charming and co-owner of a hot club in town, so he was looking for a challenge. He found that challenge in Brandy Webb. Brandy is not your average female. She is high maintenance and rich. She does not deal with men like Darnell, for they are mid-class players. Darnell wants Brandy badly and goes through a lot to get her. While he is chasing Brandy, though, his old flame Mia is back in town from the Army. Darnell still has feelings for, but mind you, he is still chasing Brandy, and Mia is dating a well to do man. Darnell finally is able to get a date with Brandy, and after spending lots of time with her, he accomplishes his goal and "hits it". After he hits it, he loses interest in Brandy and pursues Mia. However, Brandy is not going to let Darnell go that easily. She does all she can to get revenge on Darnell. The whole while Darnell's mother is warning him about playing women, but he always brushes her off. In the end, Darnell CERTAINLY learns a lesson. I absolutely love this movie. The comedic performance is wonderful. I love the plot. I have never seen a black movie with this type of plot, so it was different. Martin Lawrence showed innovation in creating this movie. It is also neat that he named this movie after the song entitled "A Thin Line Between Love and Hate". The song and movie are about the same subject: "The sweetest woman in the world can be the meanest woman in the world, if you make her that way". This is a line from the song. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh and some drama. 
A cross between Lawrence humor and Hitchcock suspence. Martin plays the "playa" and uses his comedic style to provide the humor. This time there is less of the absurbed humor than in some of his previous movies. The Hithcock suspense is Lynne Whitfield's character. How many ways will she make the man pay and in the end to what degree does the playa learn his lesson. For the Martin Lawrence fan there is no disappointment. Maybe his best to date 
I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT IS PRETTY GOOD . THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT LYNN WHITFIELD HAVING A FATAL ATTRACTION FOR MARTIN LAWRENCE I LIKED IT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. BOBBY BROWN CO-STARRED IN THIS MOVIE ALONGSIDE MARTIN LAWRENCE I LIKED THIS MOVIE IT CONTAINS, DRAMA, ACTION,AND SUSPENSE ALSO, LYNN DID A ATERIFFIC ACTING JOB SHE PLAYED HER ROLE VERY WELL. FIVE THUMBS WAY UP!!!!! 
This is funny. Martin Lawrence is hilarious. I loved when his car windows were broken in front of the police station. How funny 
I thought this movie was a mix of Boomerang and Fatal Attraction. It had a nice cast (Martin Lawerence, Lynn Whitfield, Bobby Brown (small role, but he did his thing), Regina King). Ladies man gets caught up when he plays the wrong woman, and becomes a victim of her revenge. The movie is not super great, but it was a fun movie. There are parts that will make you laugh 
This film reveals the complex mother-daughter relationships of four Chinese families whose roots from the past intertwine within the present causing conflicts and misunderstandings in their lives. Once the stories from the past are told and understood within the context of ancient Chinese culture and values, the mother-daughter bonds of love become even stronger and indestructable. The stories of the four mothers are told from the cultural viewpoint of the past as flashbacks throughout the film. The viewer learns boys are more revered than girls, a daughter is given in an arranged marriage to a boy from a wealthy family and she is expected to be obedient to her husband and servile to her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law expects a grandchild and blames the daughter-in-law for failing to produce offspring, not recognizing or accepting her son's part in the problem. This particular story was cleverly resolved and had a happy ending due to the creative efforts of the daughter-in-law who used superstition, religion, and cultural values to get out of this unhappy marriage. In another life story, a young attractive daughter is raped by a wealthy businessman, her parents disown her not believing this story. They thought she allowed herself to be seduced due to his wealth. To sustain herself, she became his fourth wife, a concubine but also produced a son, an heir ...whom the first wife took ownership of, as if he were her son. The real mother was not allowed near her own child. Eventually, she proved herself a worthy daughter by a sacrificial ceremony done for her dying mother. Later she reunitd with her first child, a daughter, whom she raised within the businessman's household where the mother enacted an even more heartbreaking sacrifice ... All the stories from the past are connected in some way with the problems the Chinese daughter's are experiencing in their adult lives. Through flashbacks in time, each daughter recalls her own past and how she felt pushed to do things for her mother, trying to please her, yet feeling unworthy. The film blends the stories of all the characters in a very creative and unique manner helping the viewer understand how the context of Chinese culture became the foundation of love on which all their lives are based. June one of the American-raised Chinese daughters begins telling her story and the relationhship and conflicts with her mother who had recently passed away. The roots of the misunderstandings become more clear as the viewer learns about June's mother's life in China ... June learns the expectations her mother had for her, the hopes and dreams for her American daughter were part of an unresolved loss her mother never spoke about to June. June learns about a very painful experience in her mother's life which forced her to make decisions no mother should have to make ... However, due to a letter written by Auntie Lindo to June's relatives in China, June is reunited with her mother's secret past. This is the point where everyone who views the film will need a handkerchief or tissues... Erika Borsos [pepper flowe 
"The Joy Luck Club," in my opinion is about as close to a perfect movie as I have ever seen. I would not hesitate to give it ten stars out of a possible ten. The mostly Chinese American cast is absolutely superb in their performances. My favorite character is June, the daughter of Suyuan. At the beginning of the movie, her friends and family have gathered together before she is about to go to China to meet two sisters she did not realize she had until after her mother died. The movie centers around four Chinese women and their daughters. The experiences of the women in China, apparently between the two world wars, were often filled with sorrow and suffering. Their stories are told in Chinese with English subtitles. The experiences of the women in China as young girls and young women strongly influenced how each of them raised their daughters in the United States. I have only a couple quibbles with this otherwise outstanding movie. One is that the women, as young females in China during the 1930's, are occasionally unusually bold in asserting themselves with men who oppress them. While, as a feminist and a very strong believer in completely equal rights based on gender, I generally applaud most of their actions, it does not seem historically realistic given the unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship of Chinese women during that time period. "The Joy Luck" is a great film in all respects, the peformances by the actresses, the general storyline, the cinematography and the music. This is a movie I can watch over and again, enjoying very much on each occasion. The ending to this movie when June meets her two sisters, apparently in Shanghai, is a great scene and very moving, one of the best endings to any movie I have ever seen. 
This movie is a beautiful story about four Chinese women and their four American-born daughters. The stories deal with identity, survival, sacrifice, love, respect, pride, and forgiveness. I cried at the end of this film because this movie stresses the importance of mother and daughter relationship. We carry the spirits of our fore mothers and it dictates what we do with our lives. I have one negative comment to make and it involves the image of Asian men. After drying my tears from watching this movie, something struck me hard because I felt this movie made Asian men look bad. Yes, there were two positive Asian male characters in this movie. There was the stereotypical Asian father who played June's father (one of the daughters). Then there was Lena's second husband, but he came across as a token. It felt like the producers threw him in to keep the Asian community from getting upset, because there was no story development about him and Lena's life and their love, but you knew EXACTLY what happened with Waverly, Rose, and their white husbands. The one character that really bugged me was Rose. Her husband cheated on her because she was too much of an Asian wife. She put her husband's needs before hers and as a result, he wanted to leave her, which she tries to stop. It is not until she learned the story of her grandmother that she understands her "worth". After learning her worth, she and her husband stays together. The movie is blaming HER and her culture for why her husband cheated, but blames Asian men when they do the same thing (am I the only one that sees this?). I am a black female (how odd for a black woman to be defending Asian men) and I have studied the Asia culture, so I know this movie is bias. What strikes me as wrong is this movie is often compared to "The Color Purple". At least the black men (like Mister) are allowed to change to become better men and the women did not rely on men (of any race) for their happiness as this movie does. There is nothing wrong with finding happiness with a man (I am a traditionalist in that perspective), but Rose needs to dig deeper to find out why she is so needy. If you want a more balanced portrayal of Asian women and men, check out the movies from Asia. However, this movie is still a MUST SEE! 
I was told to watch this film after I told someone I loved Memoris of a Geisha and I really liked this one. Told through mostly flashbacks the film tells the story of 4 elederly chinese women as they look back on there lives in China and then when they live in the us, the story then goes on to there children and they show how they live there lives. The film shows how the mothers are all in there children and then show the heartbreak and joyfullness of family. The story is wonderfull and will get you hooked from begging to end. The acting is great from each actress but the flawe is the film is long and I was ready for it to end. But overall it's agreat film to be watch by everyone 
The Joy Luck Club had stayed with me all these years even when I examine my own personal life in the current time. I had read the book when I was in the seventh grade and had a remarkable teacher. She was Mrs. Lattimer (and yes, she was white), a Harvard graduate teaching at an impoverished neighborhood from where I used to grow up. Sometimes, I wondered why she never taught at one of the more prestige middle schools even right now. Still, it was a book that we middle school students had to read and analyze. The class was actually an advance seminar class. Even to this day, I am surprised that we middle school students got a chance to watch a rated "R" movie. It was a "never" to watch a rated "R" movie. The only movies that I can remember watching that were rated "R" were movies in my former AP english literature class-Othello (which actually contained nudity). It's funny because from what I recall, I had couple of friends from the regular classes and they have never seen a rated "R" movie shown in an educational setting. Perhaps being in a gifted class really did come with all the special privileges(even though I was never identified as "gifted"; I was recommended). It just seemed that every book my classmates and I read in AP english could never resist incorporating some kind of sexual element. Indeed, the literary works were very great. And of course, sex is also shown in this movie. Besides the entertainment value of this movie as well as the complex relationships between the mothers and the daughters, it was certainly a movie about survival. Presently, as I sit in my comfortable room, I could only relate to the need to survive and live a fulfilling life, a life that is so wonderful and full of bliss. Life is about survival. The word "survival" will always vibrate and echoe inside my ears and in my mind. It is a word that summarizes the very essence of life. When you're child or an adolescent, it is about surviving through school. Once you graduate from high school, a new level of survival comes into play; and that is to make a living. Let's face it. Life really does center around making a living. We all need and want to live a life free from having to live a low standard of living like poverty and shortages of healthy food and crapy material possessions. Virtually everyone desires to have a career and be financially stable. In times where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer, insecure feelings arise and stays in tact somewhere in our minds. The desire to be married to wonderful wife or husband, the desire to feel safe living in a dream home, the desire to not feel frieghtened when you are heavily sick, the desire to give your children and your grandchildren the best possible life, and the list can go on forever...-Indeed, let's face it, MONEY MAY NOT BE EVERYTHING, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE ALL STRIVE TO OBTAIN IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS. Money does have its value contrary to the popular belief that you hear about how money isn't everything or how money can't buy love. Like the feather of the swan-This feather may look like any other feather and seem worthless, but "it comes from a far away distance and contains all of my good intentions. 
This movie has stayed with me since I first saw it almost 8 years ago. I'm very happy to have found it to add to my collection. This movie explores the complex relationship between mother and daughter. And though the story focuses on Chinese mothers and their American daughters, the struggles are timeless and so is the love 
Being first generation in an Asian American family, my sisters and i can really relate to this movie. We watch it about once a year with our mom (who is Chinese) and we always laugh and cry. My favorite part is the scene with Waverly bringing home her boyfriend to meet the family and how the cultures clash. We made our boyfriends (who are all white) watch that scene especially so they know how to act. The part that always brings the most tears is the scene with June and her mom after the crab leg supper. Very typical of Asian American families espcially if you are the first born of immigrants. Recommended for all mothers and daughters to watch 
Flawless and Beautifully Rieveting "The Joy Luck Club" has to be the best movie I have ever seen, and probably will be the only one of it's kind. The story is beautiful and timeless and I encourage everyone to see it. It makes you think of the relationships of your family and how, even though this is a movie, it can impact you beyond belief. It will rock you to the core of your being and I am living proof 
Having Asperger's Syndrome, I was having trouble picturing what is in the book, so when I watched the movie I finally had an idea of what the setting was. What came to a surprise to me was that Rosalind Chao (Keiko O'Brien in Star Trek DS9) was in it. I liked that, but I also liked the emotion behind the mothers when they were young, especially An-Mei. It was saddening when we saw why Suyuan had to leave her two babies behind; I can't tell you why, that would spoil it. I liked this better than the book 
Who cares about the facts; the truth? I do. Evidently Robert Greenwald doesn't. This so-called "Documentary Collection" will live historically as evidence that Mr. Greenwald, et al, have distorted the facts for purposes of promoting their own self interest. This is the kind of thing and the type of people that gives our party, Democrats, a questionable odor. In this respect, their efforts have failed to attract the intelligent portion of our party to support their project. I give it 4 stars for production quality and for distortion of facts, which seems to be the real purpose and their true goal, also 4 stars. I'm sure there are some who will disagree with my review. Be advised: I simply call things like I see and hear them. 
At the risk of sounding like an old salesman... You can't afford not knowing this information Period. The Documentaries here are of good quality and well put together, from start to finish. They are a great place to start /or good for adding on to your civic library. They Discuss some weighty topics and glimse into things are being done around us/you with/without your consent. We spend a great deal of our time feeding into the madness by not voiceing our opinion by not voting etc.. But at what price? By and large a great deal of people have become complacent to the crap going on around them, and the watered down news they are spoon-feed. Among other things it's full of the underlying message that "things are just the way they are". "Don't bother" there's no use trying to change things, don't rock the boat. But what purpose and who does this message serve? Selling has gone hi-tech from being in your face on the street to being beemed into your house packaged slick, all contrived by guys with Phds after their name. The big Corps. know how to get their message "inside your head". Information is a product, and the best defense to be had by the best sales team that money can buy. Information begets Power. Ultimate Power Leads to Corruption, and so on... (Also Check out the Movie "The Corporation") I think you know whos winning so far. It can be scary stuff to comtemplate for sure. And with threats that exist today on account of liberty we need to be cautious that our intentions are not misconstrued when we question authority figures. But Look what just hapened with ENRON becuase of a very long Chain of people refused to question and demand proof of the spin that the CEO Rank and file was putting out for years. This Chain included Many Bankers and Many Attorneys. For many years Enron execs. got away with it, until a young journalist stood up and said hey wait a minute! I understand very well how large corps. operate and what your telling me just dosen't add up! This young woman wrote an article for a magazine that got the whole ball to start unraveling! And in terms of the Business world she was a nobody! besure to see that movie (ENRON)too. It explains a lot of things as well. Well, we really live in exciting times in more ways than one. Ha. Scary, maybe, Futile, no I don't believe so. But, what you don't know about CAN hurt you and worse! Thats a fact! These Videos are a of a growing movement of people in all walks of life, that are trying to get out and share what they know. A veritable grass-roots movement, you'll never see these or anything like them on television. If you can't afford the money or the time to read all the books being written on these subjects,there are so many these days. Than videos like this are a great alternative. Many of the Facts and topics discussed can be verified and check to a great degree. A lot of Videos like this one use footage taken right from the news and reports that didn't get aired twice before they were yanked. A lot of people are connecting the dots. And lets face it videos are way more entertaining to watch! This set includes 3 DVDS plus a Bonus One with Lots of Extra footage. There are well worth the modest price.  
This collection brings together three movies produced by Robert Greenwald in one inexpensive box. Please note these are movies produced by Greenwald; he driected two of the movies, but one, Unconstitutional, was directed by Nonny de la Pea. The three movies are: 1) Uncovered. A selection of experts comes together to comment on the merits and logic of the intelligence on WMD that led us into the war to topple Saddam Hussein. Though the experts are not equally of one mind, they seem to agree that the arguments for war were unsound and the war is unjust. Please note, this is the original one-hour version of this film from late 2003, not the feature-length version released in 2004. 2) Unconstitutional. What were the circumstances behind the passage of the USA Patriot Act? What are its provisions? What are its ramifications? The sad fact is, no one seems to know. The language is muddy and incomprehensible, and as it is with your auto loan, so it is with your government: if you can't read the language and understand it yourself, someone is trying to hoodwink you. 3) Outfoxed. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has his own idea what news should be, and it's not just cold hard facts. Media critics, journalists, former Fox employees, and others come together to dissect the Fox News Network and shed some light on the inner workings of its politically motivated machinery that take place out of sight of the public. This collection also includes a disc of bonus content that embellishes on the content of the documentaries, showcases the publicity that has accompanied the films, and details some of the process of making and distributing the movies in a timely manner. This disc is, frankly, boring. Not everyone will appreciate these films. Robert Greenwald and his creative team start with a position in mind and marshal evidence to support the conclusion they want. People so firmly entrenched in their beliefs that they don't want to hear other arguments will shut their eyes and ears, while people who agree with the positions in these films will only be ratified in what they already think. But in a media environment that has fallen in love with the documentary film as a means of communicating ideas back and forth, Robert Greenwald has perfected the concept of reaching out to an audience without resorting to the slick urbanity of Morgan Spurlock or the self-superior smirk of Micheal Moore. This collection is a good way to get your hands on a thorough introduction to Greenwald's work. This collection is recommended for political fanatics, documentary afficianadoes, and film lovers looking to learn more about the world around them 
Not quite as funny as I remembered, but I was a lot younger then. It still gets me to chuckle and is more clever than most children's entertainment 
This is always the Question raised by fumbling,but faithful companion Pinky to his counter part "The Brain",where on every episode are off from the laboratory to "Take over the World".Two little lab mice with big intentions go out each night in hopes that this day will be their day, but, to no avail. Other characters appear in this collection that are equally funny.Rita Runt(Smart Singing cat not so bright dog) both unwanted by society trying their best to carve out a good life for themselves. Also Mindy Buttons, Mindy a youngster basically being baby-sat by her faithful dog Buttons.Mindy finds herself in many compromising dangerous positions,Buttons saves the day,usually getting the brunt of the pain too, with very little if any reward from Mindy's mother. Spielberg cartoonists do a fine job on this project. 
Pinky and the Brain are hillarious. As good as Looney Tunes were back in the day 
Wonderful fun stuff laced equally with stupidity, humor for the t.v. and media addicted, and humor for those with rather developed I.Q.s The only problem is: this is only Vol. 1...there's more episodes, and they aren't here and of course you'll want them NOW, not later 
Pinky and the Brain are my favorite and the collection is fantastic. I have waited for years for this. Great job 
This is a superb collection of one of my all time favorite cartoons 
Great selection of the best cartoon series ever. Video and sound quality is good. Special Features are unusually interesting 
This is soooo good. About time that Pink and the Brain came out on DVD 
I'd always try to catch this show as a kid. Every time I watched it I was busting a gut with laughter. The show was okay when on Animaniacs and then became awesome when it sent solo... well at least until the third season IMHO. Anywho, seeing this show any time I want to via DVD is great and I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the sho 
After DVD #4 in this series turned into a recap, it is quite a relief to find the story underway again, with all of the characters following one path or another towards Jaguera's keep. Most viewers don't realize that this is a 30 episode series (the last four are an OVA), but even with that much remaining, these episodes are tense and exciting as we build to our first chilling meeting with the darkest of the Nobles. The opening episodes follow Tsume, Toboe, and Hige in their search for Kiba. As hope dims their irritation with each other mounts only the discovery of a native tribe calleed the Hmong (very much echo our own Navaho and Hopi cultures) manages to keep the peace. There the wolves are accepted, and we first encounter the legend that it was wolves that were the first people, from whom humans were made. This experience makes so great an impression on Toboe that he feels a strong urge to remain with the human tribe. Kiba, in the meantime, seems to have wandered into a version of paradise. It is a beautiful world of woods and water where he meets a beautiful feline (My) who seems to be his soul mate. Gradually we realize that, for all his happiness, he is in danger of forgetting both Cheza and his quest. Finally they are reunited, and the wolves start out again after Cheza, somehow closer together for all their experiences. The wolves come upon a battle between Jaguera's troops and the remaining soldiers of a large city. The join in and are directed to Jaguera's castle when the seek clues about Cheza's whereabouts. Next, attention moves to the fates of Cheza, Blue, Hubb, and Cher. Several battles trigger a great deal of path crossing and the four are first reunitied and then split up to make their way to the final confrontation. Then we are back with the wolves on their trip across a sea of ice. This brings about one of the most dramatic fights of the series as Toboe suddenly comes of age as a wolf and ceases to be the runt of the litter in one spectacular moment. Finally we come to Jaguera's keep for one final chilling image. Once again, we know why this has been a consistently excellent series. One of the things that make this series so memorable is the consistent attention to character development. So many anime hold themselves to a minimal amount of character writing. We rarely see characters like go through the kind of development that Quent Yaiden work's through as he realizes that Blue is a wolf, not the family dog, or Toboe's remarkable turnabout in this DVD. We wind up caring as much about the characters as we do the plot, as much impressed by their depth as we are by the artwork and music. Wolf's Rain turns into a memorable experience, rather than just an entertainment. I cannot recommend this series enough 
This episode was just as good as the other five, oh, who am I kidding, it was awesome!!! The minute it came out I immediatly bought it. These episodes were truly amazing. The first episode was about how kiba thought he,d found paradise,and met a pretty girl there named Mew. But something was wrong their and he couldnt seem to remember much...Youll find out when you bye it. Meanwhile Hige, Toboe, and Tsume are trying to find him. Hige seemed depressed, I think its because they cant find Blue. I dont want to spoil anything else, I guarrantee youll LOVE this volume, and you can tell its good by how much stars it has, so please bye it, and please see if this helped you, it helps me alot to know if something is good. Bye!!! Youll Love It!! 
I really enjoyed the Wolf's Rain series but have not seen the final episodes. Fortunately some kind reviewer (Shibby) decided to reveal some terribly important points about the ending in his/her review as if it was totally irrelevant. I will never understand the human race...oh well I'll get over it. Watch this show. Don't read anymore reviews (lest thy eye be stricken). Skip 15-18 which are recap episodes if you can 
After Darcia's keep is destroyed by another Noble, Lady Jaguara, most of the main characters are seperated from each other. Kiba wakes up to find himself in an idyllic wilderness paradise, with a lynx-like creature named Mew, who can assume human form like the wolves. Kiba feels at peace and begins to forget about the past, present, and future. Has he found Paradise, or is there something more sinister working underneath it all? As his friends desperately try to locate him, they encounter a human tribe who look suspiciously like Native American Indians whose legends say they are descended from wolves. As the human world begins to descend into full-scale warfare, Hubb and Cher continue their search for Cheza, who was captured by Jaguara's forces along with Blue. And let's not forget about Quent, the wolf-killer whose life just might be saved by the creatures he hates. After being infuriated by the last volume of Wolf's Rain, which consisted entirely of flashbacks and recycled animation, this was a welcome return to a series that I rank as one of the best. Like Cowboy Bebop, this anime has a very American feel to me. At times, it seems equal parts fairy tale and visionquest. In an interview with one of the shows creators, it is stated that some people just "won't get" this series. In other words, they won't comprehend it and get behind it and support it. But I promise you, if you let yourself go and get involved in this story, you'll enter a world more incredible than any other film out there. Once again, Yoko Kanno's score is majestic and ethereal and elegiac, with a few electric guitars thrown in for good measure. Masterpiece of animation and music and characterization. The subpar extras continue as the only thing we get here are 3 textless endings. Audio is English 5.1 and 2.0. Japanese 2.0. English subtitles if you want them. Also recommended: Cowboy Bebop, Escaflowne. There is also a manga version of Wolf's Rain 
I am a huge anime fan, and this is by far the best. Lemme just say, God I can't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is. It inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy. The whole series is actually based on a true story in Japan. A few hundred years ago, the entire population of wolves in Japan became extinct. There are people there, even today that report wolf sightings occasionally :) If you're a fan of wolves, or looking for something a little different, CHECK THIS DVD OUT! The musics great, the drawing is perfect -- not just a random bunch of stills like most animes, but actual movement! You get 4 episodes per DVD, each is a little over 20 minutes long. This DVD includes: 19. A dream of an oasis -- this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep. Kiba finds a place where he is truly happy, and wonders if he has finally found paradise. 20. CONSCIOUSLY -- this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series. It has gorgeous music, and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever, just brilliant. 21. Battle's Red Glare -- Orcom's men are fighting against an enemy, and the wolves are caught in the middle. We see a lot of Blue in this episode (she's so cute as a puppy :) and Cher. 22. Pieces of a shooting star -- The group decides to cross a sea of ice, but it turns out not to be such a good idea :( Toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff. I can't say enough about this series -- unless you've seen the whole thing, you can't judge it. It's made by the same people as "Cowboy Beebop" and this DVD is preparing us for the typical BONES conclusion ;) The next DVD is way sad and very depressing; no matter how tough you are, you will be crying by the end 
I have seen plenty of anime, but out of all of them, Wolf's Rain is by no doubt the best. The plot is very well written and keeps you interested till the end. Dont listen to those who tell you the Wolf's Rain is a stupid and simple plot because its not. Its only stupid and simple if you don't understand it. To get most enjoyment out of Wolf's Rain, you would have to know a bit of Japanese mythology, but its not necessary to still love it. Sadly, the final episodes aren't out yet and those are the saddest you will ever see. All of the characters except Kiba die off in the saddest ways imaginable, and the ending leaves a lot of open ends for you to consider. I would give Wolf's Rain a 10 out of 5 if possible 
I'm glad that I found this anime because it is unique and has a good story. The actors are all good and the characters well fleshed out. There is a good mix of drama and action in the episodes. The animation is also very good 
Kiba, Tsume, Hige Tolboy and Blue head towards the City of the Noble villeness, Jagera, while along the way, running into some familliar charactors. The world, it seems, is rapidly coming toward the end. As Hubb, Cher and Quint are in persuit, we begin to learn of each's background, and it seems as though all (including Blue and Cheza)continue to run into circumstances where they trade off traveling partners. And wat's up with Hige? Hige begins to suffer strange bouts of headaches and dementia...all to do with his past. There is a lot to it, but as they used to say in "The Prisoner", "That would be telling...". Again, the storytelling, soundtrack and animation are fantastic. This series is something quite different than any other Anime series I've ever seen. My only real complaint about the series is why we don't seem to see too much of the wolves in their true wolf form. I know there are a lot of idiots out there who like human-centric shows and games, and who would equate stories involing animals as Di$neyesque, yet this is a story (as admitted by writer/director Keiko Nobumoto), about a pack of wolves on a journey...that fact alone makes this story unique. I suppose they are trying to suggest that the wolves have human like emotions and feelings (I've raised and have been around wolves most of my life, and in my opinion, true wolves are probably the closest thing to humans in the animal world). On a side note...many of my friends have asked what's up with the way the wolves are dressed in their human guises...what I read into it is that the wolves don't really understand the concept of fassion...to them, cloths are just scaps of cloth and leather that cover the body from the feet to the neck. My suggestion to the producers is that if and when they make a film or season 2, the story would be alot more interesting and challanging to show the pack in their true wolven forms at least half the time. If you have seen most of the episodes so far, this disk is the build up to the fianl five episodes. Pay carefull attention, because what happens in most of these episodes has meaning in the final five episodes. If you've only seen this series on Adult Swim, pay attention to the opening credits (never shown on the Saturday Night airings of Adult Swim through 2004). It has a lot to do with the final episode. If you are about to order the entire series, or just getting ready to recieve the final disk, go out and get a couple of boxes of tissue to go with it...it's going to be a trademark Studio Bones ending (IE: Cowboy Bebop), though more open to a film or a second season. 
This DVD possesses some of the best editing and production that I have yet to see in a child development product. Each of the sections (cognitive, physical, and language) is well researched. It's easy to understand and highly accessible. Just as perfect for a personal library as it is for staff development 
This series of "to walk," "to think," and "to talk" is a great resource for child/human development. It portrays current research in a brief yet engaging manner. I use it in my Human Development course and students consistently find it helpful, informative, and interesting in demonstrating concepts and research that we're covering. The second series of "to feel," "to belong," and "to relate" is also a great one. 
My profession is in Child Development, particularly autism, and I have been searching for many years for an effective teaching tool for parents and students that is enjoyable and informative at the same time. I have even tried rather unsuccessfully to video typically developing infants and children myself to use as tools. Nothing can even remotely compare with this series of documentaries: "To Walk", "To Talk" and "To Think". I cannot wait for the release of The Baby Human II which includes "To Relate" and "To Belong". Not only a great teaching tool, but a WONDERFUL baby shower gift! Pauline A.

I saw part of this series on cable and had to see more. Unfortunately they haven't come out with the full series on DVD yet - I think this is the only one available. It's extremely interesting viewing and shows a lot of research done with infants as support. I haven't seen any other programs like it 
This was very well done. The DVD presents various topics like movement, speech, perception related to infant development. They include clips from some very interesting research studies. The DVD is very fun to watch. The true highlight of the DVD is the many many babies!!! Will give you some insight into infant development. Truly, even if you are infant specialist and know everything there is to know about infants and toddlers, this DVD is worth it - lots and lots of cute babies in action : 
True, this isn't a series for parents looking for advice (as one of the previous reviewers critiqued), but this is MY FAVORITE baby show and I am very glad that I can ditch my tapes now that it is out on DVD. There are a great many more episodes than those listed on this single DVD-- let's hope that this disk is profitable enough so that they decide to sell them all! The episodes present classic psyc. experiments of developmental perception that are simply facinating. If you are taking an intro. to psycology course and all the dry textbook descriptions are putting you to sleep, get this DVD! Actually looking at the sweet little guys go through the set-ups will help you remember the different cognitive stages. They are just too cute! and it is neat to see what "tricks" you can play on your own little fellow 
A wonderfully insightful program whether you have kids or WERE one, which I think covers just about everyone. You learn not only about babies and toddlers but also about yourself and how you developed. My only complaint is that there are not enough episodes available for purchase. 
This show is absolutely fascinating. It is one of the most interesting and educational shows I've seen about childhood development. The show does a great job of showing various experiments being done at different universities around the country and then talking about the conclusions from the experiments. The only reason I am not rating this a 5 is because they only included 3 episodes on this DVD. I am pretty sure that there are more episodes in the series. I'd love to see the whole series on DVD 
Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell- in all of its incarnations- is an exceptionally literate and stimulating franchise. But the best of these incarnations is the second season of Stand Alone Complex, directed by Mamoru Oshii. Even at the most superficial level, the visual and sound design of the series are pathbreaking. But Shirow's vision for the manga was deeply informed by artificial intelligence theory and philosophy of mind. This series continues to explore these themes, even as Oshii has added on layers of international politics, speculative history, diplomacy, systems theory, law, bureacratic infighting, Japanese culture. The final product is even richer intellectual and dramatic material than its closest rival, the new Battlestar Galactica. Unlike the Matrix, this series gets better with each installment, with a bit more of the puzzle revealed in each installment. This is because - also unlike the Matrix- there is a POINT. This is not an endless symposium on the dualing natures of technology and humanity, it is thesis-driven and these questions are ultimately RESOLVED. The stories are so complex and the pace of the series is so quick that many viewers complain that it is impossible to follow. But this is merely an invitation to multiple viewings, and they repay the effort with interest. 
The seconf GIG is trying to be good. I only watch the show just to see the action the story is boring. I love the being opening scene with the music playing even the animation is a little better then the first season. And its a bit more mature then the first season 
The second season of Ghost in the Shell gets off to a very slow start, filled with talking heads that inform us how the political situation has changed since the previous series ended. It couldn't be more topical to contemporary America. You see, the main conflict of the show is being caused by a refugee problem. After the last war lots of Asians immigrated to Japan in search of a better life since their countries were poor and Japan was relatively rich. They were welcomed at first as a cheap labor force but over the years the Japanese began to think twice about the situation and realized that the immigrants are a huge tax burden. A new Conservative government has been formed, promising to deal with the problem once and for all. But there are elements within and outside of the government who are not prepared to wait for legislation. So, in the first episode here, a group called the "Individual 11" takes the Chinese Embassy hostage to protest against the parasitic immigrant population. Section 9 is called in to rescue the hostages, and if no innocents are killed, they are promised full reinstatement by the new Prime Minister. In the second episode, another human being/cyborg scarred by the war and its effects, fantasizes about mattering in a society that doesn't recognize the need for love in individuals. He constantly daydreams about killing all the people he despises and even falls for the Major, who he mistakes for a prostitute. In the third episode, "Cash Eye" is the name of a thief who is so good that she even tells her victims when she is going to rob them! It's up to Section 9 to stop her from robbing a multi-millionaire who will be busy giving a sex-doll soiree at the appointed time attended secretly by very high-up dignitaries. Lastly, in an episode reminescent of an early episode last season, an attack helicopter whose pilot has had a heart attack is taken over by its AI and suspiciously, is joined by other unmanned aircraft in the immigrant district of the city. Their purpose....unknown. Section 9 is called in by one of the government intelligence services who seem very aware of the situation. As though they knew about it before it happened? 2nd Gig has a very different feel from the first season which seemed obsessed with Catcher in the Rye references and cyber crimes of sometimes Enron complexity. This first volume seemed firmly grounded in real-world problems. Namely, what do you do when the equivalent of a slave labor force begins to revolt against its masters and demand more rights? Some people believe they have the right to be here. Some that they should all be kicked out. When a population sees itself as threatened, they fight back, whether this population are the legal citizens or the immigrants. Of course, this show came out in Japan long before the current immigration issues that are now plaguing America. But it's just eerie seeing this. The situation in the US could very easily slip into the conflicts we see in Volume 1 of 2nd gig. Everything about this second season is top-rate....except maybe the writing. The second episode in particular is really slow, since Section 9 is hardly in it at all. While I liked the experiment they did by doing that, it's too early in the show to take the focus off the main characters. Yoko Kanno's music, while masterpieces, seemed to strain to make boring scenes dramatic, but most of her score improves the show, especially a homage to the first Ghost in the Shell movie when the Major falls backwards out of a high-rise, turning on her Predator-like camouflage as she descends after blowing a terrorist's head off. This show looks like it might be great, once it gets past the exposition. Extras: Interviews with the director and two designers who worked on the show. I would also recommend: The first season of Ghost in the Shell SAC. The two GITS feature films. The SECOND edition of the manga which features panels cut out of the original American release. The Matrix trilogy. 
Well, I thought that I was the only one who's DTS Disc was freely moving in the Box. I'm shocked to read I wasn't. But even though the package had to travel to Germany I was pretty lucky because the DVD made it here without scratches. I hate to say it, but this is typical for Manga Video. Just think about the poor quality for the NGE Movie Disc's. They tend to mess up either in production or packaging 
For a little more background: Movies (The Puppet Master plotline): Ghost in the Shell Ghost in the Shell: Innocence TV Series (The Puppet Master in the movies never existed): Season 1: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Season 2: Ghost in the Shell: Second GIG Manga Ghost in the Shell: Different than the first movie, but related. Ghost in the Shell: Innocence (I have not read it). Ghost in the Shell: Man Machine Interface (a story set a few years after the first movie, it follows the Major in some later activities; it appears to take place after the second movie, but the second movie was published afterward, and they don't refer to each other as far as I know). ---------------------------- The second movie picks up after the first movie (the puppet master affair plotline). ---------------------------- I have seen almost the entire 2ng GIG series. It possesses a more gritty and tight feel and story than the first season. The animation style is markedly different. In fact, the whole production value, while quite high, was still lower than the first season. This was something of a disappointment to me, as I had expected them to exceed the past, not fall behind it. The story, though, is still interesting as Section 9 fights for its own life and survival. We learn a great deal more about the past, and every episode is, like the first season, crafted with what I think is a certain sort of genius. I await the end of the second season with great anticipation 
I'm in the UK and therefore it cost me quite a lot to have this package shipped over the Atlantic but it's the only way to see this series until way into next year. As has been reported below the packaging is very poor because the DTS disc (the very one I want) is not secured correctly on the double disc spindle and has been bouncing around for the last 4000 miles! The disc surface is now scratched and damaged. I see no point in sending it back to Amazon for replacement because the chances are it'll happen again so I'll have to try and get it repaired which is a nuisance. This item would have got five stars were it not for this problem and it's a great shame 
The series starts right where the last one left off. For those new to Ghost in the Shell universe it works like this... - Ghost in the Shell (Movie) which launched it all. - Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (Movie) the sequel to the first movie. - Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (Seven Volume series on DVD available for purchase here on amazon in a box set) - Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2nd GIG (Basically season 2) The movies have the same characters, but the storyline and arcs are different from the series. The second season, or 2nd GIG, delivers more of what GITS fans want including the great soundtrack by Yoko Kanno. The music from the series is definately a big part of the series and the opening title music is just as good as the original. We welcome back the entire cast in the 2nd season and introduce several developing plotlines in the first four episodes. From watching the first four episodes it looks like we are in for more great animation/storytelling from the creaters of the 1st season 
It's a nice package overall. definintely worth buying. The ony dissapointing things are first, the package design. Often you'll find the first DVD loose in the metal case as both DVD's pop onto the same spindle and often the outer one isn't pushed down far enough to click into place. They end up fairly scratched by the time they hit the stores or your mailbox. Second, the box promises a bonus of a "textless" opening which doesn't actually appear to be on the disc. (note: Only one of the DVD's has the bonuses, not both 
This is one of the best sci fi animes out there and the colour transfer and quality of the DVD picture is smoking! The storyline seems better than the first season but I didn't really like how the two disc stick on top of each other! Other than that everything else is fine 
I think we should all just pretend that John Hughes died tragically in 1990, shortly after working on the brilliant "Uncle Buck." He was not at all involved in such films as "Baby's Day Out" or "Home Alone 3." He did, however, make several great movies in the 1980s, including "Sixteen Candles," "The Breakfast Club," and "Weird Science," the films enclosed in this lovely collection. A lot of people have been very critical of the inclusion of "Weird Science" in this collection, but I am not one of them. It's true that this is not really a Brat Pack movie, but it is a John Hughes '80s film, and it is great. It's also the third movie he directed. "The Breakfast Club" is the second. "Sixteen Candles" is the first. So, basically, this collection gives us the first three classics that John Hughes brought us, so I don't see the problem. "Sixteen Candles" (1984): This will always be my favorite of the John Hughes movies. It's a bonafide classic of the '80s with wonderful performances from Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. This is my favorite because it's really funny (Long Duk Dong especially, and Anthony Michael Hall's team of geeks) but also sorta touching. Anyone can identify with Samantha Baker's sadness, and how she doesn't really know why she's sad, just that she is sad. That's really quite touching, in my opinion. There are some great scenes, like the one between Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall in the shop room, or when Molly Ringwald and her dad (Paul Dooley, recently on "Desperate Housewives") have a nice conversation at night in the living room. It's scenes like this that make the movie truly great, more so than other teen movies. "The Breakfast Club" (1985): While not my favorite of the John Hughes films, this is also a classic and quite possibly the most famous of his work. I'm a sophomore in high school, and I still hear people talking about this one all the time, which proves just how enduring and timeless the work of John Hughes really is. This movie is a wonderful ensemble with great work from Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, and especially Judd Nelson. Also, Paul Gleason is the perfect jackass. Great '80s fun with plenty of touching moments and a wonderful ending. "Weird Science" (1985): This is just plain wacky fun. It's different in style from the other two films in this collection, but I love it just as much. It's crazy and wild and out of control and it's just great. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan-Mitchell Smith make the perfect geeks, and Kelly LeBrock is so wonderfully sexy. A noteable part of this movie is the incredible Oingo Boingo theme song, "Weird Science," which is just about the coolest song ever. So, what about this set? It should be noted that the three disks in this collection are the same three disks from the previously released "High School Reunion Collection," and even come with an ad for that collection. The quality is great. The movies are all remastered in anamorphic widescreen and look beautiful. The cool thing is that "Sixteen Candles" and "Weird Science" come with their original theatrical soundtracks and not the changed VHS soundtracks, which is really nice. The thing that makes this collection distictive is definately the gorgeous binder package. Looking at the above picture is not the same as really seeing it. This is just a beautiful piece of art. It really is a binder, with clasps and everything, and the movies enclosed in little slips on the clasps. It's truly lovely and looks very noteable on the shelf. This set also comes with an extra CD featuring eight great '80s songs, including "True" (Spandau Ballet), "If You Leave" (Orchestral Maneuvers In The Dark), "Weird Science" (Oingo Boingo), "Oh Yeah" (Yello)," and "Don't You (Forget About Me)" (Simple Minds). This set is definately worth buying for this CD. I listen to it all the time. I love these songs, so much, and each one is good, although my favorite is by far "If You Leave," followed closely by "Weird Science." Trust me, if you get this set, you'll find yourself listening to this CD all the time. It's just great. So, the only thing that this set lacks is special features. I for one was very dissapointed to see that none of the deleted scenes from the TV versions of the film made it here. All three have some footage that can only be seen on TV, but Universal was not generous enough to bestow it upon us, which is a shame. Basically, there's nothing here in the way of special features, except for trailers on "The Breakfast Club" and "Weird Science." So, if you're into special feautres, you'll be severely dissapointed. However, aside from that, this set is great. All three movies are '80s classics, and they're presented with their original soundtracks, in a lovely special case, with a wonderful music disk. How can you say no? Recommended 
This is a great set, although the extras are lacking and it would have been perfect if Some Kind of Wonderful was included as well. But the CD is a real catch for all the 80's nuts like me. Cheers
