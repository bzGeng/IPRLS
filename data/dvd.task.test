1	... but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one , and alpha video , the distributors of this classic capra movie , made no attempt to clean it up . here we have an example of a key artwork about america 's psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s , crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves
1	the royal tenenbaums is wes anderson 's third major motion picture . the movie revolves around a rich , but extremely eccentric man name royal tenenbaum ( gene hackman ) . royal and his wife etheline ( angelica huston ) had three children : chas ( ben stiller ) , margot ( gwyneth paltrow ) , and richie ( luke wilson ) . in the 1970s the tenenbaums were one of america 's premier families : margot was a famous playwright , richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive u.s. nationals , and chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen . that was almost thirty years ago and the tenenbaums have largely been forgotten . betrayal , failure , and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died . what 's worse is that royal 's children and wife blame him for all their failures . royal senses that his time is earth is waning and he wishes to set things right . with the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend , pagoda ( kumar pallana ) , royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family 's eyes . i 'm a pretty big fan of wes anderson and have seen all four of his films . the royal tenenbaums is anderson 's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture . however , it is my least favorite of his movies . like all anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue . the film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family , a theme that i enjoy . yet , the film just did n't resonate with me as much as anderson 's other pictures . i really do n't know why that is . that 's not to say the royal tenenbaums is a bad movie because it 's not . in addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting , brilliant set designs , etc . i just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead
0	this film is boring , so much so that i could only take 35 minutes of it before i was forced to push stop . this is a soap opera about politics oil companies . it 's weird jump around style is confusing pointless ... do yourself a favor and do n't bother w/ this garbage
0	my daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school . it was n't until years later that i saw it , and i was horrified ! ! ! this was a movie aimed at children ? ? ? what does a children 's movie need a sexy bunny for ? the lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and `` strutting her stuff '' on the basketball court in a very provocative manner , until the male characters were panting , drooling , and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick , depraved perverts . this scene was highly innapropriate for children , and is not the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls . not only that , the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities . this movie should be kept far , far away from children , and was truly deserving of zero stars
1	of course dead alive was the better movie . but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate , due to the fact that there is a high body count , lots of over-the-top splattery deaths , and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers , some as zombie lunch . apparently there was some footage cut out for this release . i 'm not sure if that was gore footage or not , but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence . there is even some non-gore `` grossout '' humor ( vomit-related , etc . ) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive . sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground , but again the influence is unquestionable . do n't expect the fx quality of dead alive though , this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly . i do n't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print/transfer , but it 's a minor distraction . they did a great job with a relatively small budget . i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach 's other films on us ( hopefully uncut ) dvd release -- i 've heard burning moon is especially crazy
0	this is an excellent film , which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor . i was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor , inter-titles appear to be missing , and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that do n't match the action on-screen . it 's a shame , because a film like this one deserves much better
0	while i absolutely love the show on pbs , this season was mispackaged . the box and dvd were both labeled series 3 , but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1/2 . unfortunately , i did n't try watching this disc until several months after i bought it . if you buy this , be sure you view it promptly to be certain it 's the correct series
0	even though i am not a streisand fan , i was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was . the plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for streisand 's character , making her attractive - no , irresistible - to the main male character . the problem is , she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover ! somebody ( probably streisand ) thinks that highlighted hair , a tight black cocktail dress , and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress , casual clothes , and everyday looks are disgusting . baaaaaamp ! ( that 's the fallacy alarm going off : men , in my experience , do n't care much about clothes and makeup . ) there was a lot of emphasis placed on the streisand character 's losing weight by riding an exercise bike , but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference ! yet truly , the low point of the movie is the scene in which streisand , discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother ( played by lauren bacall ) , blubbers , `` wazz i a pretty baby ? wazz i a pretty babyyyyeeee ? '' in that one scene , streisand 's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed . the whole movie is about this issue , and it 's amazing that an entire cast , crew , and production company would devote themselves to b.s . 's emotional issues like that . i really think that the `` funny girl '' phenomenon somehow ruined streisand 's thought processes . the media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped , northern european beauty standard of the time ( think grace kelly ; think ingrid bergman ... .. ) . i recall reading about how her glowing complexion , thick hair , and good figure ( as well as her energy and voice ) carried her through despite her looks : long nose , large lips , slanted eyes . myself , i think she looks like an egyptian princess or similar ; but she certainly does n't look like grace kelly ... .. so why ca n't she accept this ? the majority of us women , whatever our race , color , or bone-structure , learn to live with and love who we are ... ..at least i hope we do ! this movie is not about that . this movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable . maybe i should 've given it only one star
1	'fais-moi des vacances ' ( we need a vacation ) is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities between the classes in france while introducing us to a warmly tender and humorous friendship between two young lads . directed and written by didier bivel ( with writing assistance from djamila djabri ) it offers a slice of life we rarely see - that underbelly of france 's projects where mixed races strive to exist without the amenities of those with means who surround their neighborhoods . lucien ( aymen saïdi ) lives with his father ( bernard blancan ) , mother ( hiam abbass ) , young sister pamela ( laura mas navarro ) , and his tough streetwise older brother josé ( nabil el bouhairi ) in a small flat . close by is his african friend adama ( ibrahim koma ) and his equally poor family of father ( makan fofana ) , mother ( marie-philomène nga ) and sister fanta ( hawa yakaré sissoko ) . as school ends the kids whose families have money take them on a vacation , a state neither lucien nor adama can afford despite their obsession with that luxury . the two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a ruv of a family headed for the beach . but despite the success of their plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van 's owners , the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp , a fact that makes them flee ! upon returning home both boys ' families punish their activities and when lucien seeks comfort from his older brother , josé beats him and tells him to grow up . in the end the boys finagle their way to the beach , but of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an empty beach re-evaluating their lives . the cast is uniformly strong , the writing is excellent , and the camera work not only captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the vistas of the boys ' imaginations . it is a fine little film , one deserving of a wide audience . grady harp , january 07
0	so this was the breakout movie for mira sorvino , the one that earned her an academy award for best supporting actress in 1995 . this movie , and mira sorvino 's performance in it , was so bad that after it was over , i just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 best supporting actress category . let 's see ... ..according to wikipedia they were : kathleen quinlin ( `` apollo 13 '' - a fairly standard worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger role ) , mare winningham ( `` georgia '' - did not see this one ) , joan allen ( `` nixon '' - did not see , but how hard can it be to play the wooden pat nixon ? ) , and kate winslet ( `` sense and sensibilities '' - did not see either , but ang lee was robbed by the academy here also ) . it only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today 's hollywood that mira sorvino could win an oscar for this sort of performance . and i was beginning to warm up to her , too - she was great in `` romy and michele 's high school reunion '' , and terrific also in `` beautiful girls '' . so , what exactly is so bad about this movie ? here 's a brief list : 1 . mira sorvino plays the entire movie in a high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking . another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard . maybe in 1995 , because she was new , the academy did n't realize that this was n't her real voice and took pity on her ... . 2 . stupid plot device of the greek chorus . 3 . stupid happy ending with a twist . 4 . lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies ... ..while this movie is not itself a porn flick , the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it not a movie for families to watch . 5 . odd sight of a very old and wrinkly woody allen ( with dyed hair and bald spot ) making out with two women young enough to be his granddaughters ... ..all right , so i 'm just jealous - woody still looks gross ... . 6 . cliched , poorly developed characters , a plotline that goes around in circles , and lots and lots of pointless , unfunny dialogue . in summary , this movie is bad , bad , bad ... ...
1	robert redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions , but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl ; the state of art in all its wholeness . redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced : good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands , if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator . this picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious , artistic and perfect american film in the last quarter of century ; besides , the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life , enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss . redford ' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and i really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity , the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent ; and so the new directors to come , understand the true cinema meaning is art . thanks to his generous personal effort , for having created the sundance festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions . special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years : scarlet johansson .
0	-not a great one here , entertaining for all the wrong reasons , mainly because the film is so bad , so often . -it is nice to see christina ricci in a movie again , as she 's usually good even in a bad movie and does n't do too bad here . -wes craven directs this one and i could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation ( much like edward norton in `` the italian job '' ) . i could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script , both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb . also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects , as they were very lousy at times , especially when they finally showed the werewolf . -as i said before , quite predictable the story was , both ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck . then both try to figure out what 's wrong with them , though the brother is much more active about it than ricci . -it 's also quite obvious who the main werewolf was , the film tries a bit of a swerve , but it does n't really work . -besides ricci , the cast includes shannon elizabeth ( american pie 12 ) , portia de rossi ( arrested development ) , joshua jackson ( pacey on `` dawson 's creek '' ) , scott baio ( do n't ask me why ) among others . all do pretty poor jobs , besides ricci that is , the rest do n't really seem to care , not that i blame them that is . -there is some humor throughout the film , but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it . -the only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew .
0	eric maibus and scott bairstow have become fine young actors , and even their adequate performances can not save this dismal , pointless , lurid and sadistic movie . dee wallace stone should be ashamed for participating . maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult , with no conscience , morals , or regard for anyone but himself ; bairstow plays the usual `` misunderstood '' teen who looks to the group for acceptance . the script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence ; enough is enough . if this is the way teens talk , then steer me clear , folks . there is no heart or soul in this movie , and no reason to rent or buy . no stars . c'mon amazon , when you gon na give us the 0 stars options ? ?
1	the economy , austerity and directness of the films of fritz lang made him one of the most profound , and precise filmmakers ... lang , a master of the german expressionist film , shot his first talkie , a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies ... it was a shocking idea for its time , based on the real-life killer peter kurten , headlined as the vampire of düsseldorf ... 'm ' is about a terrorized city , and a plump little man with wide eyes ( often chewing candy ) who is a pathological child-killer , unable to control his urge for killing ... the film embodies several lang themes : the duality between justice and revenge , mob hysteria , the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in , and , for probably the first time in the cinema , it adds a new dimension to suspense : pity ... for the killer is clearly mentally sick ... he can not overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease , and yet , we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal , rather than treated as a sick man ... early in the film , the killer is heard whistling the grieg theme from 'in the hall of the mountain king ' . this theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace ... and when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window , the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there , just out of sight ... the murderer is played by peter lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since 'casablanca , ' 'the maltese falcon , ' and 'the mask of dimitrios . ' when the photographs of his victims , all little girls , are shown to him , he jumps back and twitches with horror ... with powerful visuals , lang 's motion picture is lorre 's first film ... his performance as the corpulent , hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion ... lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes , outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal ... he had only twelve lines of dialog ... in the most famous of all about a pathological killer - alfred hitchcock 's 'psycho ' - anthony perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured peter lorre , but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy ... 'psycho ' reeked with blood and horror , whereas the suspense of 'm ' is subtle ... a child 's balloon without an owner , a rolling ball , are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed ... the audience , trapped in its seats , torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer , watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight ...
1	i have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968 . granted , that version is marvelous . i have bought both versions and love them both . ok , it is difficult not to compare when watching . but i ca n't help wondering : if this version would have been the first i or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version , if people would have been complaining about that version ? i can have different versions of vivaldi 's four seasons ca n't i ? actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all ( and i do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other ) . we would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version , would we ? i have gone to the opera numerous times and watched don giovanni three times . every time with different performers . remake ? absolutely not . i think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it , because is such a great play . so , logically this would not be a remake ! why ca n't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other ( splendid 1968 ) version when doing so ? that done , i must say i understand why alais is in love with king henry . patrick stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses very well . he is a very good match to close 's queen . i did not care for richard , i thought he was not commanding enough , bit whiny . i think john is a difficult part to play to say the least and i did n't care for him either , too much the idiot . geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good . king philippe : too much a boy , although he has moments when the interaction with king henry makes him interesting . alais : good enough . which of the versions do i prefer ? that is difficult . i have highly enjoyed both . i think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of hepburn and i prefer her to close . this version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic ( alais and henry ) approach . i definitely prefer stewart to o'toole , who seemed too young for the role . i liked the way stewart made us see henry 's self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming ( that is , until the end , when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart ) . o'toole had a very serious approach all the time . on the other hand : anthony hopkins and timothy dalton were both splendid . i think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast . which of the versions i watch , depends on the mood i am in . i think they are both good in their own way .
0	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad . the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky ( rodney eastman ) was in the movie . ( for about 5 mins ) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
0	`` modigliani '' ( 2004 ) is a self-indulgent , pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist . writer-director mick davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work . ironically , the viewer has a better understanding of pablo picasso than amedeo modigliani . despite his boundless enthusiasm , andy garcia is simply too old for the title role . an irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate
1	much of the plot has been outlined above , as well as the cast and i am , in large part , in complete agreement with the positive reveiws recorded . i want to add that , for anyone raised on the old universal horror pictures , or the films directed by james whale or val lewton , where the suspense is the important part of the film ; this picture , shadows and fog , has this quality absolutely dripping from every frame ! despite the comedic elements ( and there are many funny things happening ) the tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative . the climax is dissapointing for many , but if you follow the subtext of this extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution in all ways . i have had philosophy students who were struggling with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times obtuse oblique writings of hegel , kant and the like . i beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people thinking that they were about to see bananas or sleeper . love him or hate him , you have to admit , woody allen is deep . a personal favorite film of mine , but definetly not everybodies cup of philosophicallly comedic tea
0	this movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list . overall , i was somewhat disappointed with this film . i figured there would be a little more real suspense or `` thrill '' but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events . the biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between eastwood and russo . it was contrived , lame , and almost laughable . i had to rub my eyes to make sure i wasnt having a nightmare ! john malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role . unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves . clint eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self . no problem here though , clint was solid . the film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end . the climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although i saw it coming a mile away . there was not as much suspense as i was hoping for and the `` thrill '' was mostly missing . what else can i say , watch it and make your own decision but overall i was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews
1	`` above the rim '' is an entertaining street drama that focuses around kyle lee watson , an inner-city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him . he wo n't listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game , as he thinks that he is the best player ever . he 's been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout 's attention , but he does catch birdie 's eyes when he plays . birdie is a well known gang leader who offers kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a `` shoot-out '' basketball contest that means the world to him . kyle -- being impatient as ever -- agrees to join , not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him . a high school security guard with a past knows the danger that birdie presents , and he is the only who has a chance to get through to kyle before it is too late . not only is this a very good basketball movie , but it is also an intense and character-driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life ... and how we have to live with them in the long run . the film has some great performances from duane martin , marlon wayans and the late tupac shakur . even though everybody is great in their roles , the showstopper is indeed shakur . he gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over . my only complaint is the length of the movie . it 's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half is n't short , but i think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie . i think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story . still , it is a really good movie that did n't disappoint me . the dvd does n't have a whole lot to offer . you can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen , depending on your preference . the movie looks and sounds very good . the only special features that are offered are movie trailers , and those are n't even that great . i would 've loved it if they included the music video , `` regulate '' by warren g and nate dogg . in fact , given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie , they could 've included a couple of music videos . it 's not a great dvd , but at least it 's not that expensive . i really enjoyed `` above the rim . '' it may not be flawless , but it definitely does more right than wrong . the characters are what really dominate the movie . even if you 're not a fan of the game , it 's still something to check out if you 're a fan of character drama . exciting , intense , conflict-driven and full of heart , `` above the rim '' is a very well done film . -michael cran
1	jean renoir 's masterpiece , 'the grand illusion ' , is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme , something we can all understand and relate to . the triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times , is kind of an ironic theme considering hitler 's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history . nevertheless , jean renoir 's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films . it is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb - jean gabin is one of the all time great actors.. jean renoir 's innovative approach would influence countless directors to come , including orson welles.. criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is 'the rules of the game ' jean renoir 's greatest satire
1	this dvd gives a very good 60 minute workout . as others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy . the first time i did it , i felt a bit awkward with the steps , but when i did it the second time i was able to follow along with no problems . the dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine . if someone like denise austin were leading this one , i do n't think i would play along . minna is by far my favorite instructor , so i go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout . i would n't want to do this every day , but it is good to have something different in the rotation . i think the toning section is excellent . i am not looking to bulk up . i just want my body to firm up and look better when i wear shorts and a tank top . i like how she combines upper and lower body exercises . it 's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes . i use 3 pound weights at this point and i can see where in the future i might be buying 4 pound weights . minna is a great instructor . she has excellent cueing and is very encouraging . she is never annoying . i also have her optimizer- balanced blend dvd and i love that one .
0	a broad range of jewish-related-topic movies varies from `` trembling before the g ... d '' to `` the holy land '' , where jewish humor , emphasis on the holocaust and musical inclusions are predominantly accustomed features of . of course , modern israeli cinematograph concentrates more on day-by-day israeli reality , incorporating h o h m e s ( sarcastic jokes ) if necessary . something more linking to a secular modern american reality supposedly depicted in this film does not impress me at all because of a surrealistic mixture of sex-bent traditionally-characteristic inter-religious-confession-gesheft ( profit ) pieces of gay-lesbian-adultery-quickie-drug-secular-hasidic traces of affairs , which is too much for one hour plus story of enjoying their seder continuingly . sorry , it is definitely not my cap of tea . if even this play is r-rated .
0	when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary . to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime . this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people . the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing . also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered . this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other . i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it . if you do n't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny ( i would n't take it for free )
1	that i bought this movie orginally to see david boreanaz naked . i am very glad that i did . it is a very funny comedy that was a bonus of david 's nice tush in the movie . if you have ever been a baby sitter in your life , you will get a hoot out of this one
1	yeah . it 's true . this movie is awesome . i think i watched it four times in the first week i had it
0	this movie is so bad . it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems . the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character , a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities . the movie tries hard to invent new `` teen speak '' with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much , they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend . the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds , desprate to beat you over the head with them . in the movie , the main character , cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her . nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer . she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end , she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out .
1	sorry , after reading some negative reviews i just had to speak up . this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen . i still to this day watch it over and over again . well directed , some of the best acting i have seen , and my god the cast in this movie , the list of stars is endless . the courtroom scenes were so intense , i envey anyone who has not seen this yet . the story was perfect and so many surprises and turns . really well done . this movie is worth every penny , i just wish i would of got to see it in the movies . it is the most powerful movie i have ever seen , how can anyone say this movie was not good , i guess they just ca n't handle the truth..
0	stay away from all the movies from wesley snipes ' and steven seagal 's . they are brain-dead movies with brain-dead screenplays , bad directors , bad everythings . this movie , like other viewers ' said , drove me nuts . i have to wear straight jacket to refrain myself everytime when i watched these two guys ' movies , otherwise i might have crashed my tv set or trashed everything around me in order to vant my frustration . amazon.com should also stay away from selling this crappy movie . god help us .
1	eraserhead is filled with strange , uncanny scenes . what is it to be uncanny ? dictionary.com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis ; beyond the ordinary or normal ; mysterious ; arousing superstitious fear or dread ; uncomfortably strange . i would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time . one has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere . the movie does not have a linear , logical storyline . it is a mood piece , for want of a better term . a visual poem , which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen . if you let your mind play among these images , it will begin to invent meaning for itself . you may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it . the cinematography is stunning , not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term , but arresting : you simply can not turn your head away . will you like it ? well , i think this is one of those movies you either love or hate . think of it as a rorshach -- how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are
0	i did n't enjoy the film . i also did n't enjoy the original play by shakespeare . king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays . i do n't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done , and to add nothing of value to the original . you can set it wherever you like , in medieval japan or on the moon , what 's the difference . it 's king lear , a downer of a play , there 's nothing great about ran just as there 's nothing great about lear , and it takes up three hours of your time . a moron named lear , or hidetoro , or whatever his name is , relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son . the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father . he is right , of course , and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily . he 's wanted dead or dead . in this treatment of the annoying plot , he loses his mind . he has a faithful follower or two . they overact . there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play . lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk . am i supposed to care what happens to him ? why ? because he used to be a powerful king , and a cruel one ? you may as well cry over saddam hussein . look at this movie with fresh eyes . look at shakespeare 's king lear with fresh eyes . this stuff simply is not very entertaining , and is not very good . the hell with king lear . he 's an annoyance
0	while not one of his best novels , tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time ! jimmy smits does his best , but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble ! ! skip it ! ! ! !
1	the book offers what feels to be a valuable revelation about improving your game . the information is well presented and the cd is a nice addition ... but really i think counting the the tempo/timing to yourself would be more effective ; at least that worked better for me
1	this movie is by far one of the greatest movies ever made . you will laugh all the way thru it..and enjoy when things were so much simplier in hollywood
1	if you ca n't get enough of zombie comedies this year , i seriously recommend this one , made in the czech republic of all places ! i saw it at the tribeca film festival ( ny ) and it was tremendous fun . bloody , funny , and smart . an intellectual twist on the `` secluded retreat '' idea - a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives . and of course , they 're overrun by zombies . i especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore-fest . it works on so many different levels - while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral , your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes , the interesting characters , and the joyful way it plays with film conventions . this is a rare and unusual film to come out of the czech republic . i was disappointed that it did n't get a theatrical release in the us , so i 'm really glad that it 's coming out on dvd . humor/horror fans will not be disappointed !
0	i find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and i also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen tvs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that can not be properly watched if one has a widescreen tv . these movies scream out for the widescreen , they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible . yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen tv and , with one exception , all the people who have written about them dont seem to care . `` oklahoma '' , `` carousel '' , `` south pacific '' and `` king and i '' need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen ( also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well ) . fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future ( ie observe the two versions of `` an affair to remember '' ) of course , this is a major rip off , so anyone with a widescreen tv who has not bought these films -- hold off , coz sooner or later they will get a proper release ... how long ? that is anybody 's guess , but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen dvd technology ( `` sound of music '' is fine and `` state fair '' was made in non widescreen full screen format , an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen
1	the folks at pbs deserve the gratitude of photography teachers and students everywhere . taking on subject matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th century america ? this documentary covers -- sometimes comprehensively , sometimes briefly -- virtually every important topic germane to the field of study , from pictorialism to straight photography , from fashion to the scientific . along the way , we are introduced ( or reintroduced ) to what has been the medium 's most important uses : journalism and documentary . `` a century of images '' is as instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those already familiar with much of the material . underlying a wealth of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that raise this effort above the mundane : concern over the ethical issues photographs present , and the effects of mechanically produced images in the post-industrial age on the psyche of our nation . these themes manifest themselves in ways that are often revelatory and moving . one memorable example : the way edward curtis 's images of native americans are placed into context by a woman who appreciates them , yet yearns for more images that show her people the way they `` really were . '' sections on war photography cover wwi , wwii , vietnam and the gulf war with compassion , and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on todays situation in iraq . another bonus : the section on the transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness . until i was able to buy this fabulous history on dvd , my biggest complaint was that while using the vhs version , i had all kinds of problems locating the various scenes i wanted to pull out to show my photography and visual communication courses at the university where i teach . now that i can happily locate scenes at will using the dvd menu , i can direct my ire at its few but significant omissions and shortcomings . more on walker evans , robert frank , diane arbus please . . . . they were pretty damned influential .
1	you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut ... but it 's actually the opposite . i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school . this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people ... this movie is the real thing , i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too
1	this movie is perfect for people in their 40ies and/or 50ies . it just hits the bullseye . lean back and enjoy the ride
0	this movie is so dumb that it 's as good with the sound off as with the sound on . the only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads . a plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an ok movie with a good script , but this script has no charm , no wit , no nothing
1	sound of music 40th anniversary edition ( fox ) is the latest digital version of this beloved , timeless , film . the two-disc set features an exceptionally sharp transfer and a rich audio mix but the real treat is the new commentary with julie andrews and christopher plummer ( this in addition to the late robert wise 's commentary ) . among the wealth of new treasures in the six hours of extras is on location footage , screen tests ( mia farrow sings ) and a wonderful retrospective documentary `` my favorite things : julie andrews remembers . '' sound of music is perfect in all departments . it 's also that rare musical in which the music itself is naturally integral to the story and a counterpoint to the nazi threat of the true-life plot . until hi-def dvds arrive , this is the definitive edition for the library . rated : g. genre : musical . 2 hours , 56 minutes . starring : julie andrews , christopher plummer . director : robert wise
1	we all know the movie and story of the silence of the lambs . i reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me , it is one of the best films ever made . now , with red dragon , i give it 4 stars but i think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is ... . anthony hopkins , the brilliant actor who plays hannibal lecter . i do n't think this movie would have been as good if hopkins would n't have played the role of lecter . i own the original manhunter , which is an older movie and it was good but hopkins can not be beat for the hannibal lecter role . this is a great thriller film ! ! edward norton delivers a very good performance as retired fbi agent will graham . when a series of serial killing style murders start , graham is called out of retirement to help the fbi catch the killer known as `` the tooth fairy '' . he eventually seeks the aid of lecter to help him find who this killer is . like silence of the lambs , we find graham visiting lecter in his maximum security facility . very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence . this movie holds true to the book with the same name . we get to see lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in s.o.t.l . without going further into all the details of the movie , i 'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after s.o.t.l . and the movie hannibal . also , ralph fiennes delivers a good performance as the red dragon . for anyone who has n't seen this movie , it 's a must see ! ! ! !
1	this is my favorite toning workout and i 'm sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone-fest . what i like best about it is that i can customize it to whatever body part i think needs the most work this week . need a 30 minute ab workout ? you can choose it . think the arms and legs need work ? no problem . want to tone a little bit of everything ? you can do that , too . the instructors are all good - clear , not irritating , and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part - it 's not your standard crunches for ab work on this video . this was one of my best purchases , workout-wise . i wish there were more dvd's/workouts out there with minna lessig - she is my favorite instructor ( she does the arm/leg workouts on this dvd ) . the other two instructors are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by , although at the end you do know you 've worked those muscle groups .
0	this amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series , the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny . usually these amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along , the episode with christopher lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and ingrid pitt as a sexy vampire thats it , what a waste
0	obviously , the music featured here is of high-quality . hardly sign of the times transcendent , but nonetheless very exciting ( as was typical of prince 's 2002 tour ) . unfortunately the director does his/her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub-bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound , hamfisted camera angle switches , bizarre washed-out colors , some horribly cheesy effects and cuts . for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity , it 's a shame the director clearly has n't the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber . hey prince , just so you know ... .your diy `` npgmc '' approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you 'd been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you . if it looks this amateurish then you just look , well ... amateurish . and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur-level presentation . the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this . i mean really , you re-shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam/antwerp footage was not up to par : i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this . hardcore prince fans such as myself will want it despite this , but casual fans ( especially those not familiar with the more obscure prince material that makes up most of this concert ) should definitely avoid .
0	why ? why waste your time and money on producing crap ? sony execs must be out of their minds . the ghostbuster fans have been waiting years , and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on dvd , and this is what they come up with ? no . give us season dvds . give us a 140 episode box set . give us something . not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold many times that . what a waste . this product gets 1 star because , apparently , you ca n't give it zero
0	i have several kathy smith videos this is the absolute worse ! i agree with some of the other reviewers that kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated . also , it seems like there a too many people in such a small space , the whole set looks very chaotic . i wonder if kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself , it is very poor . all those crazy shuffle moves ! any other kathy smith workout will be better for you than this one .
0	there are certainly some memorable scenes in this film , but as a whole it just did n't quite work for me . vlastimil brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character : fanda , a maddening yet adorable grandpa , oh-so-young-at-heart , oh-so-mischievious and impish , but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you ca n't help loving him warts and all . in fact , that 's one of the fatal flaws of this movie : the lack of any dark side to any of the characters . they 're all basically harmless walt disney types , even the bumbling and self-absorbed son . there are no real consequences to brodsky 's actions other than stella ( his wife ) finally talking divorce but it 's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she 'll come back to him . there is no center , no force or dynamic power in this film -- -it 's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you do n't want to hurt the feelings of your host . the ending also relies on another lazy device , the virtual deux ex machina in the person of stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice/supporter of fanda 's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable . this film might 've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with fanda 's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death , instead of focusing on how clever , audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is , which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse , narcissism . one wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with mr. brodsky , who is a towering figure among czech actors , that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him . a more accurate title for this movie , especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll , might be : `` the fantasy life of a poor old man . ''
0	not a good copy of this great movie . i 'd wait and buy the `` restored authorized edition . '' even though i bought this version , i 've ordered the other . that 's how much i like metropolis is general
1	since `` er '' debuted on nbc in 1994 , it 's taken the nation by storm . it 's wonderfully produced by author michael chricton , a former surgeon before his writing career . for numerous years , it was the # 1 drama series on television . the show starts with the cast of anthony edwards ( mark greene ) , george clooney ( doug ross ) , sherry stringfield ( susan lewis ) , noah wyle ( john carter ) , julianna margulies ( carol hathaway ) , and eriq la salle ( peter benton ) . it has since won and been nominated for several awards including emmys . its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode . its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes . season one introduces the everyday life in the er in chicago . throughout , it explores many critical issues including hathaway 's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt , carter struggling as a medical student , ross living his sex obsessed life , and others . regular show viewers who have n't seen season one will see part of lewis 's reason for leaving chicago in 1996 , greene in his first marriage and before ella 's birth ( mother is corday , who began in 1997 ) , deb chin 's ( played by ming na ) brief time in that er as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000 , and many others . such combination shows partially how the show 's theme evolved to today . episode by episode , the plot 's quality stays on top . the overall scenery , through the physical environment to the emotional drama , never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience . season two features the debuts of gloria reuben ( jeanie boulet ) and laura innes ( kerry weaver , not an official cast member until season 3 ) . this season explores ross 's most heroic act as a doctor , carter becoming a doctor , lewis being forced to care for her neice , and many more . today 's viewers who have n't seen season two will witness boulet before testing positive for hiv , weaver before realizing her lesbianism , hathaway before her today 's happy life ( though now in seattle ) , and others . this plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season . it continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama . both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast . all add their own sense of individual theme into every scene . through personal struggles , drama , and continually saving lives , everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor . such show quality makes `` er - the complete first two seasons '' worthy for all fans . this is sure to please its audiences . new viewers should watch these two seasons first . otherwise , the plot will be confusing . fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future
0	i bought this because raquel welch was in it . she did a good job but it 's not worth it . i loss interest as sonn as i heard the guy talking about the people in the movie . this dvd was dated back to the 1920s and how a movie star struggles to get his life back
1	while it is certainly fun to watch just to see the performers , this history of rock simply does n't jell as a whole.by trying to explain the evolution of the music , the pleasure gets lost along the way.if you are a rock connaisseur , you wo n't learn many new things if you watch this.what you should do is take it as a starter point and then go further with documents who gets deeper with one particular field ( ex : motown or british invasion ) .as it is , it tries to cover too much ground at once and still manages to forget a few artists like emerson , lake and palmer and king crimson among others.it costs me $ 80 dollars ( canadian money ) for this 5 dvd set , which is too much for what it 's worth.rent it and enjoy the clips
1	believe the good reviews written here about this film . i havent cared much thus far for the movies penn has directed after this one , i suppose its because i feel this is such a great film , he created a tough act to follow , but even if he never does top it , he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time . i like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into , and this is one of those . although , i would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit , as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas . but overall this is a great movie , with great performances by all , and it packs an after-punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over . im not easily touched by most movies , but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits . its without a doubt one of my favorite films . this is the kind of film that reminds you , movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art
0	just show the real machines working , forget all the goofy narration that is annoying to adults and does n't even hold my son 's interest . he much prefers the fred levine series or the i love cat machines series
1	i love this film , beautifully simple and human . the characters are real ; flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them- just like your own family . i 've rented at least fifteen times , and i never get bored of it . it 's great any time of year , but fantastic for the holidays
0	i do n't know what the last poster was thinking ... this dvd goes to the top of my worst quality list . i would n't complain as much but they are advertized as `` digitally remastered , '' which is obviously meaningless . `` long john silver '' is soft-focus , borderline blurry , throughout ; marred with constant flecks and blobs ; and has countless vertical scratches that score the full image . it 's like watching some old home movie you found in a trunk . have n't viewed `` captain kidd , '' but a cursory scan indicated it too is in poor condition . if that 's the best the films come , and there 's no money for clean-up , so be it . but get that misleading `` digitally remastered '' off the box . that 's a hoodwink if ever there was one
0	like many of the reviewers here , i am an anne rice fan . however , i knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them . i mean , few of the `` dracula '' movies throughout the years have had anything to do with bram stoker 's novel . all i wanted - and expected - was a flashy , no substance guilty pleasure movie , a la `` dracula 2000 . '' that alone should tell you my expectations . but qotd failed even as a guilty pleasure . the storyline did n't make a lot of sense when taken on it 's own , and the acting was bad to bland . i also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires . rice 's vampires are supposed to be beautiful , whereas this bunch looked like eurotrash or people at a halloween spook house . however , one good thing about this movie is the music videos for lestat . since the videos are included on the dvd , it earns 1 star
0	i like almost all of lifetime 's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best . the name bring `` obsessed '' was not what it should have been called , the lady was dreaming and had an illness . this movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through , this movie was not what i had expected . as i said i like almost all of lifetime original movies but i definitely wa n't be watching this one again .
0	i was greatly disappointed in this dvd . here 's why : 1 . it 's basically 60 minutes of warming up 2 . the level 3 ( advanced ) is not that hard . 3 . the annoying `` inhale , exhale '' chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center . ' i just wanted to tell her shut up 4 . i did n't break a sweat once . 5 . i used it twice and never plan to use it again . i mean , c'mon , i do n't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that wo n't get me results . i must say the only thing positive about this dvd is the landscape . in short , rent this from blockbuster or buy it used . do n't waste any more than 5 bucks on this . it 's not worth it .
0	with a good script and a director better suited to the material ( i 've read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct ) , asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson . unfortunately , the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms ... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession . the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist 's wife ( an excellent natasha richardson ) and one of the asylum 's patients ( an equally good marton csokas ) , under the watchful eye of the patient 's doctor ( ian mckellen ) . there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie , some of which seem quite preposterous , at least in the way the movie was shot . the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson . she does her best in spite of the choppy script , and she even won a best actress award in london for this film . however , as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession , director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job . ( in fact , i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson , credited as an executive producer , sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out .
0	with the phenomenal success of `` the poseidon adventure '' , the first disaster movie of its kind , the sequel was sure to be a hit . not so . a plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great . having a leading lady ( sally fields ) fresh from an oscar win and a few veteran actors ( michael caine , karl malden ) , might also sound promising . unfortunately , the magic of the set production of the original is not even close . instead of upside ballrooms , barber shops , kitchens and bathrooms , the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes . the rest of the cast is comprised of television actors , who are as wooden as the script . there 's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous , you wo n't even laugh in disbelief . irwin allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel . considering the original , that 's a terrible shame
1	as socrates once said `` i drank what ? '' frank bigelow ( edmond o'brien , you may remember him as winston smith in `1984 ' 1956 ) realizes after he had a one night fling that he does not feel so good . he feels bad enough to see a doctor . yep he is d.o.a . ( dead on arrival ) as he has been poisoned and only has a little time left to live . obsessed with finding out who did it and why , frank has to reconstruct his wild night . will he find out in time ? if so what then ?
1	this movie was very hard to find . found it in dvd an it was new
0	this one is just plain awful ! ! it 's a bunch of hollywood brats being histrionic .
1	this is great holloween movie to watch to get you in the spirit ! i watch it numerous times every year right before holloween with my little sister . its a great movie ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	the story here dose n't matter . the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending . scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction , meth . quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless . roberts is so gay you want to smack his face . he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity . rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius , a role he plays better than anyone today in film . br
1	this set is fine as far as it goes . however , where are the strawberry blonde and the oklahoma kid ? warners has given other actors 6 or 7 disc sets . why not cagney ? on the other hand , maybe a cagney , volume 2 is in the works . let 's hope so
1	ok , first of all oct fri the 13th i finally saw this movie in 3d , sigh i can die happy ! ok this one is really pretty awesome . chris plays a great leading girl ( the only f-13 leadi didnt want to see with an axe in her skull ) . the other characters are pretty harmless too . wev'e got bikers ( snort ) , pothead hippies , a fro 'd chubster and a dude who can walks on his hands better than he can act . plus this came out in the early 80 's so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore scenes . i give this one a high-5 ! cool deaths , funny scenes and aside from chris 's sherbert pants , some decent 80 's fashion too . yo debbie , i want your bikini , too cuuute .
1	season four is excellent , ca n't wait for the release of season five
1	moving , intelligent , realistic , not overly acted ( as could quite easily have been the case ) . about a 20 year old who has gone off the rails to come back onto them again ... you see why this has happened , feel sympathy , and just want him to do well when the film ends . a story about hope , in a world with little..
0	as the reviews below indicate , `` arthur '' has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 vincent canby of the new york times found it a wonderful `` screwball comedy '' ( although over time , times readers , perhaps more discerning than vincent , have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars ) and bravo listed it # 10 on its list of best comedies ( see below ) . i first saw dudley moore in `` foul play , '' thought he was very funny . based upon that , i bought `` 10 '' and `` arthur , '' as it turned out a downward trajectory . what i dislike about `` arthur '' is moore playing a loud , obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes , and minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves arthur for himself , not for his $ 750 million fortune . even john gielgud , who was great in `` the loved one '' a much better comedy , ca n't resurrect this turkey . okay , folks . start casting your negative votes . in the meantime , here 's the bravo 100 best comedies list : 100 . anchorman 99 . the birdcage 98 . school of rock 97 . happy gilmore 96 . four weddings and a funeral 95 . harold kumar go to white castle 94 . waiting for guffman 93 . the aristocrats 92 . father of the bride 91 . revenge of the nerds 90 . clueless 89 . slapshot 88 . team america 87 . the kentucky fried movie 86 . zoolander 85 . dirty rotten scoundrels 84 . silver streak 83 . sister act 82 . tootsie 81 . half baked 80 . lost in america 79 . three amigos 78 . bananas 77 . flirting with disaster 76 . ghostbusters 75 . dumb and dumber 74 . trading places 73 . city slickers 72 . moonstruck 71 . roxanne 70 . the nutty professor ( eddie murphy ) 69 . the blues brothers 68 . broadcast news 67 . kingpin 66 . dazed and confused 65 . office space 64 . this is spinal tap 63 . manhattan 62 . the pink panther 61 . election 60 . when harry met sally 59 . police academy series 58 . private benjamin 57 . swingers 56 . young frankenstein 55 . bull durham 54 . ferris bueller 's day off 53 . dr. strangelove 52 . meet the parents 51 . national lampoon 's vacation 50 . the princess bride 49 . american pie 48 . american graffiti 47 . 9 to 5 46 . the incredibles 45 . raising arizona 44 . sixteen candles 43 . what about bob ? 42 . harold and maude 41 . austin powers 40 . monty python and the holy grail 39 . mrs. doubtfire 38 . best in show 37 . dodgeball 36 . good morning vietnam 35 . beetlejuice 34 . rushmore 33 . clerks 32 . groundhog day 31 . the big lebowski 30 . the 40 year old virgin 29 . legally blonde 28 . annie hall 27 . a fish called wanda 26 . wayne 's world 25 . meet the fockers 24 . bill ted 's excellent adventure 23 . big 22 . beverly hills cop 21 . shampoo 20 . the jerk 19 . wedding crashers 18 . stripes 17 . m*a*s*h 16 . old school 15 . fast times at ridgemont high 14 . napoleon dynamite 13 . naked gun series 12 . the producers 11 . pee-wee 's big adventure 10 . arthur 9 . ace ventura : pet detective 8 . blazing saddles 7 . the wedding singer 6 . airplane 5 . south park : bigger , longer , uncut 4 . there 's something about mary 3 . shrek 2 . caddyshack 1 . animal house my suggested additions : `` the loved one , '' `` leap of faith , '' `` used cars , '' `` eulogy '' and `` drop dead , gorgeous .

0	they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was . the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden , the paid wwe guys just began to bad-mouth the warrior . maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young , and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other . they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations . vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test . as soon as he says this , they fade to black then come back with a new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they 're talking about steroids . but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use . let 's not talk about that - let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior . and they also just try to badmouth him so much . who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him ? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including hulk . and oh yeah - they do n't even let the warrior defend himself . why did i have to find out from imdb.com that he was asked to appear but declined ? why do n't they address this ? this `` docu '' is more slanted than `` fahrenheitt 911 '' every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth , tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking .
0	terrible direction , terrible writing , it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with . although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue , it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid . it was a total watse of good celluloid
0	this is possibly one of the worst films i have ever seen . the writing and acting , as far as i am concerned , are no better than that of a middle school live performance . the only reason i did n't turn it off was that i was hoping something in the movie might help me justify spending $ 10 to buy it used . that something never came . i would never waste my time on this movie when there are others on this topic that so richly deserve my viewing time investment , such as `` schindler 's list '' & amp ; `` the pianist '' . trust me , pass it up just as fast as you can
1	this film i have to say is beautiful looking , from the characters to the landscape . although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes , it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects . the only problem is the love between the two main characters . the movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway i mean it is called heart under blade right ? the main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it . this film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals !
1	i just ca n't say enough good things about the brainy baby series of videos and toys . i have allowed my baby to watch one brainy baby video per day since he was about 6 months old . he loves them . and i love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen . : ) as soon as the brainy baby theme music comes on he starts to smile . he is captivated . i like them much more than the baby einstein videos . and the toys ... ... .he loves them . `` hello , brainy baby ! '' they are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box . i have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time . we love brainy baby at our house .
0	very short game , took about 2 hours to finish it ( took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it , because as always their `` system is unavailable , please try again later '' - took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable , and definately it will be the last steaming product i buy ) . as to the game , you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary . gameplay was average for a shooter . it seems `` episodes '' basically translates to `` really short game , which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something '' .
0	first of all , yes , this film was made in vancouver , with only a few shots of the manhattan skyline . when golden harvest was making this film , they had to try their best to shoot at angles that did n't show any mountains , and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night . then jackie chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action . well , action was what they focused on the most indeed . it sure is funny to see how the chinese thought of the united states at this time , because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls . you also get multi-ethnic gangs trashing places ( seriously , the gang has a native american with pigtails and a frayed jacket ! that 's almost offensive ) . you have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars . you have random , small-crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits ! bizarre indeed . as for the actions , this film has some of his best . the first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb , and graceful , using his jacket to dispatch enemies , and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over . he takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered , very impressive . this leads to a scene where he 's being chased around the streets of new york , where the entire gang , on motor cycles , try to run him over , and jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey . he also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building . no harness or wiresupport ! the fight scene at the gang 's hideout is also one his best , using whatever object he can get his hands ont , and very acrobatic . also , jackie chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land ! some of this was done on a broken ankle ! if this dvd was uncut and undubbed , and had the original score , i 'd give it a total of three stars . unfortunately , for a so-so film , new line makes it worse . some of the dubbing is very bad . it seems as if new line dubbed some of the original english dialouge also . only very , very little of the original cantonese dialouge is there . also , the film 's original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock . many , many scenes were cut from the original movie . not only that , but some of the action scenes were cut too . try and find an uncut version out there . this dvd you should stay away from
0	i grew up watching sesame street and truly love the muppets . however , i have to say this video was not what i expected . there were some great vintage clips , but not enough muppets/monsters for me . this video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing . i would recommend you pass on this one and get `` 123 count with me '' instead .
1	this is a hilariously written and acted film about two young people who get carried away with the beauty of an old house only to find that it is seriously flawed . tom hanks and shelly long are fantastic and people who love old houses will really identify with this
1	i like this video for it 's frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself . like yoga , it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it . the energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches . the quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm . i found that in itself very interesting and different . it is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like . she shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing , a mind bender so to speak , and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it
0	what a great cast ! i mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie , right ? after it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it , although you are shaking your head in disbelief ! stunning ! you 've never seen anything quite like it ! if you are a fan of the campy awful , you may see it as a masterpiece , if not you will still have a unique viewing experience . proceed at your own risk ! borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it . did i mention the great cast ? so many of my favorites ... even goodman ca n't save this clunker
1	i do n't have a review , i have a question . as a grandparent of a 10 year old blind girl . is it possible that someone could send me directions for this game ? i would like to get it printed in braille for her . thanks for your help..judi ree
0	it has been a couple years since i 've seen this , and i can still honestly say that it 's like watching a andy warhol movie of salvor dail puking . a kind of swirly colorful mess , with brendan fraser and bridget fonda stuck in the ooze of ick , and ca n't escape it 's yuck of a screenplay ... on a positive note , jim carrey is n't in it . other then that , nothing can redeem henry selick , kaja blackley , and sam hamm for this putrid monstrosity , and i mean that from the bottm of my heart
0	i saw this at a friends house -- so thank god i did n't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy . i can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film ! the guys are not hot ... not even lukewarm for that matter . the acting is terrible . please ... anyone who had anything to do with this , do n't continue in the film industry . if it was possible to assign negative stars , i would do so for this awful experience . run away
1	attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day . it features a stellar cast including powers boothe as a crafty roman leader who tries to use attila to gain possession of rome . gerard butler is attila , the hun , and he is everything about attila in this role , never was an actor better suited . his character is sharp , passionate , determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film . he brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with boothe even more dynamic . this is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes
1	this movie is such a breath of fresh air . finally there 's a movie that 's profound , amusing , and relatable . it 's nice to watch something that really hits home without begin cheesy or overdone and you can never go wrong with jean louisa kelly or amanda peet
1	craig is one of the funniest comics that i have ever seen . he has one the funniest standup routines , that i have ever seen . i guess that is why he was voted comedian of the year
0	fellini brings light on space instead of space on light . he brings mysticism to the movie not the movie to mysticism . he brings boredom and rattling to a new height . lots of nice emotionalism and sweat . waging tongues and blood . candles and tits . bondage and perversion . we learn italian words that we can not use . here is a good tidbit `` child of aphrodite and hermes ... hermaphrodite . '' the subtitles conveniently disappear at crucial moments . even in italian the voices do not match the sound . one of the roman dudes encolpio ( martin potter ) finally got a real part as `` doctor who '' in1983 .
0	i used to think he was great , till i caught the director 's cut of 'das boot . ' all of a sudden you 're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that was n't in the original , and the spell is broken . let 's not even talk about 'air force one . ' now i 've seen 'the perfect storm ' twice , and i own the book , but i still have n't read it because i 'm reasonably sure the book must suck if the movie is this bad . and i 'm sorry new england , but what are gloucestermen anyways , except for great rapers of the high seas ? what will they not do for a buck , you might ask . ok , they are not as bad as the japanese , but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there 's no tomorrow . watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu . sure you will find excitement aplenty , amped up to eleven . even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history . i even like some of the principal actors , but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be . this just does n't stand up to repeat viewings . unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker . do you
1	the movie is a brillant mix of drama , love , and comedy . the casting was brillant with greats like judd and bullock . in the movie we are introduced to siddalee walker a women who has made her mother vivianne mad . vivianne always seemed heartless and distant to sidda and when sidda tells a reporter about her mother some things get twisted out of proportion and printed the wrong way , which makes vivi mad . enter the ya-ya 's three of vivi 's friends . they feel that sidda should know the truth about her mother and maybe she would understand . so they kidnap sidda and start to tell her about her mother . we learn that vivi was n't well liked by her own mother and was seen as a bad person by her mother . then we learn that vivi 's first love whom she never got over was killed at war which is why she hates her husband . sidda then starts to question her current realationship thinking she 'll be a bad mother and calls off her wedding . phase two of the ya ya 's plan . they must tell sidda something about her mother that will change everything . very good plot that will make you cry and laugh at the same time . this would be a good one to watch with friends or mothers . penny lan
0	i had read -- with delight -- the book called `` mrs. frisby and the rats of nimh '' to my grandsons , so i thought the movie would be a nice followup . wrong ! it barely resembles the book , and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out . it might be ok for a child who has n't read the book , but we were disappointed
1	without words ... been waiting my whole life to get this picture ; it can take you from laughing ur heart out to burst into tears ; no comments coz i 'll ruin it but it 's simply a wonderfull movie
0	colorado 's san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is my favorite place to vacation in the usa . so when i saw the preview of durango kids on another dvd , i decided to rent it on netflix . it is one of those movies where villains are cartoonish , and the kids , while cute , outsmart all the stupid adults . the first 30 minutes showed some nice locations in and around durango , including the steam train ( that 's why i purchased a used copy ) but then it goes into time travel to save ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore , intended for young and undemanding children . do n't bother unless you love durango as much as i do
0	recent scholarship has determined the chinese invented the lightbulb in 1800 bc , the internal combustion engine in 2200 bc , and established a world wide grid of radio communication satellites in 650 ad . all this without any systematic mathematics . hurrah for the chinese . alas , like the records of the above globe trotting oriental sailor , all the information and data concerning said miracles of intellectual invention have disappeared , somewhere either burnt , or submerged in tar . but speculation continues . meanwhile , spaghetti was invented there , without which no italy would have arisen . oh , and crackers , they invented crackers , and bed posts first
0	i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea . i do n't know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them . each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way . i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense . the movies were violent but nothing one has n't seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it ... i was n't shocked , disturbed or upset ... ... ... just bored
1	joan crawford had it . star quality . when i first saw her in 'grand hotel ' i was surprised how much i was watching her character instead of the equally riveting character played by the great greta garbo . both were stars . but crawford was able to project a different kind of sensuality than garbo - a vulnerability , a plucky girl-next-door quality . in humoresque , an older crawford was still able to achieve this level of performance paired off with the younger male star . let 's face it - women have a great advantage acting ( perhaps women are always acting ) - besides being better looking than men , they can emote more without going out of gender role . a distinct advantage vis-a-vis men who must restrict their emotional range or be accused of over acting . it 's a horrible thing to fall in love . and that is just what crawford 's character does . falls in love with the worst of all possible choices : a musician . musicians only love music . the music in the film is worth the price of admission alone . who amongst you would throw the first stone at a fine violinist playing 'zigeunerwisser ' or any of the other fine war horses of the classical violin repertoire ? she falls in love with the young 'artist of the month ' whom she offers to help jumpstart his career , renting a concert hall for his first recital . she is married to a wealthy but understanding man who loves her but lets her do what she wants - drinking , philandering ... most men do what she wants and accept her ridicule . the character of the musician does not ; he 's a tough new yorker who gives her as good as he gets - and she finds herself loving him despite herself . love is madness , and when he starts being successful with his concert tours but neglects to phone her for weeks , she falls apart emotionally . it is profoundly humiliating to realize someone else can hurt you badly simply by declining to keep in touch . silence is the perfect expression of contempt , is n't it ? she drinks , she mopes about her 'cottage ' in the hamptons , she is crazy in love with a man who does n't seem to reciprocate her feelings . in our time , she might see her doc and get a prescription for zoloft to be rid of the lovesick blues and of obsessive thoughts of him . but this is before thorazine , even , and she 's just out of luck there . so she drinks . drinking was the preferred way to deaden the unbearable pain of rejection in love in the days before designer drugs were available from your neighborhood spice man . to complicate things , her musician had an old girlfriend from the conservatory where he studied music as a young man . additionally , there was the dreaded 'american mom ' in full armor . she just had to tell this grown son of hers , repeatedly , that the woman he finally fell in love with was no good . she even slaps him upside the head as he shows her around his ritzy new apartment with a view ; it seems he has too many portraits of crawford 's character in view . that 's the way , mom . make your boy marry a good girl , like you , maybe . meanwhile , and i just love a line the character played by oscar levant comes up with at her cottage in the hamptons , `` you 're not the kind of woman who lets her husband get in the way of her marriage . '' a lot funnier said than written . levant did a lot of great piano playing in the film , dropping dozens of one liners like that . he almost stole several acts . this is a very forties film . in black and white . whatever happened to the colorization process ? oh , well . finally , mom tells the rich girl to keep her hands off her son . and dutifully , crawford 's character retreats to her cottage in the hamptons , gets drunk one last time , wades into the surf in a stunning , shimmering black cocktail dress and is never seen again . i told you love was dangerous ! her lover , after cancelling one measly concert out of despair at her death , decides not to ruin a promising career and returns to the concert stage . men ! emotional iqs of 30 , at most . well , that 's all folks . if your eyes were still dry at the end of this film , you 're safe - you 'll never fall in love
1	season one of nelwlyweds is hilarious ... .you will enjoy watching nick jessica and all the funny moments that took place the first year of their marriage ! the extra footage on the dvd 's gives you even more insight from the `` lovebirds '' themselves ! i recommond `` newlyweds '' to all the nick jessica fans out there
0	this is probably the worst war related movie i 've ever seen . i am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two . time spent watching this film is time you 'll never get back and have nothing to show for it
1	this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list , and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood ' movie i can think of . i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying , thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago . my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well . great performance by all cast but especially hanks , paxton and beacon . probably ron howard best film ever
1	the story of `` alice in wonderland '' was controversial from the moment that the reverend charles lutwidge dodgson , aka lewis carroll , wrote it . some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy . others consider alice 's journey as a trip into or through insanity . for better or worse , disney did capture many of these elements , and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film . however , there are also those who loved the books and loved the film . normally i recommend disney classis without reservations . in the case of this movie , i will keep a couple of provisos . alice is a young girl bored by her lessons . as the length of the lessons grows , alice soon drifts off , until a white rabbit passes by , muttering to himself that he is late . alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever . luckily for alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent . once at the bottom of the hole , alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small . however , there is a vial labeled `` drink me '' that alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door . alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation . indeed , alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film . even the fundamental basis of alice 's journey through wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies . the ending of alice 's journey in particular is quite frightening , especially to younger children , embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares . i remember seeing `` alice in wonderland '' as a child , and i remember i thought the ending was scary , and i was relieved when alice was able to escape back to the normal world . given that this film is well over fifty years old , i was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar , if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does . the smoke did negatively affect alice as it made her cough . perhaps there is an object lesson for children here . while some consider many of the references to allude to drugs , i think that is a modern interpretation . i think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use . remember that this story was first published in 1869 . i believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by disney . for all these provisos , this film is excellent . it matches `` fantasia '' in its surreal visions , and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb . the animation is marvelous as well , readily illustrating the vision of alice 's journey . this movie is one of those rare disney films that i am unable to recommend to all viewers . whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste . if you enjoy animation oriented toward adults , then you may find this animation a treat . if you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated , you may also find that you enjoy it . i do recommend this movie for slightly older children , perhaps 8 and above , considering some of the disturbing images . good luck !
1	back in the 1980s , back before every television show was `` csi : city of your choice '' and `` law order : crime division of your choice , '' there was a veritable plethora of well-written , clever , hour-long mystery programmes - `` magnum p.i. , '' `` murder , she wrote , '' `` moonlighting , '' `` hart to hart , '' `` the a-team , '' to name just a few . and this was when most people still only had three commercial networks to choose from ( not counting pbs ) . but far and away , the best of these mystery shows ( and perhaps the most under-rated ) was `` remington steele , '' in which pierce brosnan ( with second billing ! ) and stephanie zimbalist fought crime with style , dash , wit , comedy , and a bit of romance . the series , with its rat-a-tat dialogue , vaguely deco feel ( a slight deco revival was the only good thing about `80s dï¿½cor ) , and occasional zaniness , at times harkens back to the wonderful preston sturges-esque screwball comedies of the 1930s and `40s . indeed , it 's clear from the moment that brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of season one that not only did he have the star power of classic hollywood , but he was a cary grant for our times ; devastatingly handsome in dapper saville row suits with an accent as charming and distinctive as grant 's . ( as an aside , it 's also clear that brosnan was born to play james bond - truly , who was surprised that he was bestowed with the honor , albeit belatedly ? we wo n't get into the infamous season five vs . bond debacle . ) in the entertainment field , there are actors-with-a-lowercase- '' a '' ( pretty much everyone falls into this category nowadays ) , actors-with-a-capital- '' a '' ( truly impressive sorts , such as judi dench , vanessa redgrave , and anthony hopkins ) , and then there are stars . brosnan is clearly the lattermost , bright and luminous . zimbalist , as sleuth laura holt , is spunky , and makes a valiant attempt to be rosalind russell to brosnan 's grant , but , somehow , she falls slightly flat . nevertheless , there 's no denying the chemistry between the two , which is what really `` makes '' the show . ( this is particularly remarkable considering that the two notoriously did n't get along whilst filming the series . ) references to classic hollywood are constant , and amusing - remington steele , the ( sort of ) reformed con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold has an encyclopedic knowledge of film , and often inadvertently stumbles across the solution to the weekly puzzle by drawing a comparison to a classic film . ( `` joseph cotton , orson wells , `the third man , ' british lion film corporation , 1949 . '' is a particular favorite throughout the run of the series , as are cary grant films and , ironically , the occasional bond reference . ) the show was scored by the wonderful henry mancini , he of `` charade '' ( a grant reference , yet again ! ) , `` the pink panther , '' and `` breakfast at tiffany 's '' fame ( among many others ) , which of course , adds to the caper/romantic feel of the show . ( by the way , i 'll take the somewhat chaste clinches of remington and laura over the sordidness of `` sex and the city '' to daydream about any day of the week ! ) i 'm so pleased that remington steele has been released on dvd . i was seven years old when it debuted , and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time ( i was a sophisticated child ) . but i had n't seen it since , and once again , have found myself charmed by each and every episode . for those who are too young to remember the series , check it out - it 's much more worthwhile than anything on the air now , and for those of you who *do* remember it , revisit . it 's worth your time and money .
0	do n't buy this . `` from the grave '' is overdubbed b/w film without bruce lee in it . the other two are n't great either
0	the ab portion of the dvd is good , although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether . the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set . the last one is a step-type exercise so if you do n't have something you can step up on , you ca n't do it . the dvd itself is not very professionally done . tamilee miscounts , does n't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words . abs of steel maybe , buns of steel , no way
0	i 've seen several pretty funny comedies this year , but none of them could touch what i watched saturday night . this dvd had it all , slapstick , funny costumes , hilarious sight gags , geeky dancing and more . there were times i was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt . i just could n't stop laughing and in fact spent most of the show with tears rolling down my cheeks . it was so funny , that i felt at a couple of points i was going to lose control of my bowels . yes , it 's that funny . i highly recommend this one , as it 's the closest thing i 've seen to the classic monty python days of english humor . i do n't know when i saw a movie that was non-stop hilarity , without a single moment of serious content . over two hours of complete madcap behaviour and a near fatal dose of cheese . the name of the dvd ? castles dreams , by an english comedy troupe called `` blackmore 's night '' . these guys are like a combination of monty python , benny hill and marty feldman . my sides are still aching ... .. those crazy f^king brits ... .
0	this is an excellent story well told in script and action . however , it is quite different from the version i saw on a big theater screen . this dvd has speeded up the action and the english translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue . i was very disapointed in this dvd version and would not recommend it to friends
0	i 've been a longtime fan of seagal 's movies , but i was greatly disappointed by this film . first , there were clearly sections where steven seagal 's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him . ( clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming ) it was surprising that they could not take the time to get seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections . there were also very few action sequences that demonstrated seagal 's skills with martial arts . in many ways , this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film . little action , but lots of bloody corpses lying about . i enjoyed black dawn far more , and feel it was a much better made film
1	got this on ebay for $ 18 last year - a great deal . i am only bothering to rate this as it seems ridiculous that is rated below two other rather shoddy grant collections because of the holiday backlash . objectively rating the content instead of the marketing would work for me
1	this is simply one of the best detective story ever made and jerry goldsmith 's sound track ( which i also own ) is probaby the best sound track . it was his favorite . jack , faye john are at their best
0	ga. how can anyone stand this drivel ? worst movie i ever watched repeatedly . worse than watching `` walk tall '' 8 times in a row . worse even than watching the home shopping network . eww . eww
0	francisco was right , this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust . the review on the back of the dvd says `` jaw dropping , `` but the full quote probably reads `` jaw dropping ( because i was lulled to sleep like a baby ) '' . there is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage , in the zombie attack scenes , but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie . the rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters , ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant `` evil side of human nature '' message that would be better left to jean renoir ( or even adam sandler considering the results here ) . i do n't watch zombie movies for the characters , especially characters so vapid and unengaging . it seemed like the script writer read a novice 's how to pamphlet and said `` yeah , it needs some conflict '' . if these characters were n't so constipated and bloated i 'd give them a chance . one amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of `` social commentary , '' but that 's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully . it was n't . you 'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass . the critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing , and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director 's real talent , which is ( you guessed it ) the lovely undead . the rest is monotonous dreck . i do n't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man 's dramatic rags . all that aside , the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies . a horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself , but the cut-away at the end makes you wan na kick the director in the gonads . sorry , but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron .
1	this one is an old favorite of mine , which i pre-ordered on dvd the instant i learned it was available . i have an old vhs recording of the film , which i have viewed many times . i have also read the book many times , and i consider it to be conroy 's best work . this is the story of four young men at carolina military institute , a fictional military academy located in south carolina , which is of course a pseudonym for the citadel , which is a fine military academy that really does exist . the film is set in the 1960s . the first black cadet ( first year cadets are called `` knobs '' at the institute ) has just arrived . a secret society within the institute , known as `` the ten '' has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the institute , regardless of ability . david keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet 's designated mentor . the plot moves at a fast pace , but nevertheless does not feel rushed . purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel . i feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete , and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries . i liked the script , the acting , and the ending . this is a wonderful film . it is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years , and i am delighted that it will shortly be available on dvd .
0	i was so excited when i read the reviews for this intermediate level pilates tape . thought i would purchase it for variety from my 'the method ' pilates tape . i was very disappointed . the tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat . i did n't feel like i got a good tone workout . i actually wanted to fall asleep . i felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student . i give two stars because i do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but i shall be passing this on to an elderly relative
0	by the title i would be led to believe that there is more than one george story . there is one george and a few others , one of which scares my 2 1/2 year old . i thought the stories would be animated . however , some ( including george ) are pictures from a story book . we love to read books , but videos should be more than photos of a story book . would not recommend this
1	saw this movie at a sneak preview as i could not wait for it to be released . wonderful awesome feel good movie . i bought the 2004 calendar and was anxious for the movie 's release on dvd . fabulous acting by all of the ladies . get this movie watch it with your mom ! ! also recommended : the full mont
0	this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great , including a phenomenal cast , lead by cate blanchett , and great scenery and cinematography . the actors playing elizabeth , cecil , and walsingham spoke and acted admirably , each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling , but the words themselves rendered the performances useless . the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material . they should have read elizabeth the first 's biography by elizabeth jenkins . it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain : had the author and director been more historically accurate , they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth , who is in turn hysterical , defeatist , overbearing , childish , tyrannical , who never shows her core intelligence , her great love of her people , who had a private core described by her motto `` semper eadem '' , be always one . elizabeth ruled with her advisors , she was not totally ruled by them . she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table , nor would burleigh have allowed it . cate blanchett 's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine , wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity , much less truth . how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman ? the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all . we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective , and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne . one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna . i suggest that he should have first read some english history

0	`` st. elmo 's fire '' is one of those movies that could have been better , should have been better and yet , it just was n't . it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the 1980s , the so-called brat pack ( well , everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall , who were spared this misstep ) . maybe this was supposed to be `` the breakfast club - - after college '' , but while `` the breakfast club '' had characters , even stereotypical characters , that you could relate to , there is absolutely no one , with the exception of emilio estevez ' character , that you care enough about to relate to in this film . the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois , but georgetown , where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college . uh-huh . yeah , right . judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is , nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy , in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that . andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy ( or maybe it 's just the pearls ? ) emilio estevez is a future attorney , working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell . mare winningham is a dowdy , trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity , working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her . she instead fantasizes about rob lowe , who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band , who has dropped out of school , married a white trash-y looking groupie , had a child with her and has now separated from her , and taking up with other groupies . demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking , has a serious coke problem , stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol . sounds promising , huh ? well , in what is an early portend of the `` melrose place '' to come , sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is , dumps his ass , immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy , who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job ; estevez , after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there , travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her . he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed , he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home . lowe , in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere , takes winningham 's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus . moore , after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother , has all her furnishings repossessed , loses her job and freaks out . not exactly `` the breakfast club '' . the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves . with the exception of estevez ' character , they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped . their every action , every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional . their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that . winningham 's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy , knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was . and yet , she still gave her virginity to him . maybe if winningham was n't so bright , or she was a college freshman , it would be understandable . but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent . lowe really had little to do with his role . maybe if he had played the role nelson had - - as the roving lothario , with sheedy waiting at home , it might have gone over better . with his too-pretty looks , it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him . nelson just does n't seem comfortable and does n't pull it off - -but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player . moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems , mirroring her character - - but was later rehired . while the title song later become a minor hit , `` st. elmo 's fire '' itself missed the mark .
1	it is the declining days of the great war ( wwi ) , the germans are leaving a small french town but are leaving a little present for the advancing british troops . they have buried the munitions in the town square . when the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded . the town 's people evacuate . during this the barber sends off a message to the british . the british decide to send a man to check this out . they choose the bumbling scottish private plumpick ( alan bates ) . located on the outskirts of town is an asylum . the sisters who run the asylum escape with the town 's people , leaving the inmates to fend for themselves . they return to the town , resuming their lives before being commited . plumpick arrives in town but does n't know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum . he meets the beautiful coquelicat ( genevieve bujold ) and falls in love with her . he finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb ( of course it 's more complex and hilarious than just that . ) he also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town 's people . the funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people . so shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves . this is half fairy tale and half fable . alan bates gives a great performance and genevieve bujold shows great whimsy . dvd extras : none
1	`` all men can do anything , if they will '' seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture , carefully directed by agnieszka holland , one of the major female directors in the world . this absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters . on one hand , our little girl will know the world is not turning around her ; and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true , and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life . a triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the nineties .
0	damn . there 's nothing remarkable about the second item on this dvd ; it 's your standard european-made sexploitation film . `` the wild , wild world of jayne mansfield , '' on the other hand , is reprehensible . it 's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of mansfield , clips from her movie project , and material entirely unrelated to mansfield , linked only by the voiceover ... and then , after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery , the movie cuts to her death , spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large , mostly empty mansion she has left behind . this movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after mansfield 's death . this is exploitation in its worst form . i found the sudden change in tone , the large volume of non-mansfield material , and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme . those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy , or softcore porn to tittilate , go elsewhere ; this one is not merely bad , but evil
1	i saw this movie on tv years ago and loved it . i thought the storyline was terrific . there 's plenty of action , family situations , love interest , but , mostly , this movie engages you -- it forces you to care about the characters . it 's a great movie . three words : keep tissues handy
0	another film in the never-ending series of `` giant animated snake eats people '' films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade . the creators of a maximum-security prison in the antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile . there 's nothing more to this film than that . `` boa '' ( also known as `` new alcatraz '' ) actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness , which i do n't think was a smart idea . the technical team - photography , production design-set decoration , etc . - create a fairly effective , chilling atmosphere , but everything else about `` boa '' is strictly routine . dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable , although elizabeth lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife , and the supporting cast ( mark sheppard , grand l. bush , craig wasson ) is just a touch more professional . the film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we ca n't see just how fake it looks . i do n't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with ; other , similar titles include `` python '' 1 and 2 , `` anaconda '' ( the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997 ) and `` anaconda : search for the blood orchid '' , and the inevitable `` boa vs. python '' . the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors . 2/

0	i understand that some fans would like to see more of their loved characters ( this series is one of the best as far as i 'm concerned ) , and i can understand the need in filling in a gap especually if the show has n't been aired in a while on tv : but i can not understand anyone who buys this dvd for any reason . you do not need this dvd to `` fill the gap in your collection . '' they did the same thing with chobits in episode 7 , another damn recap . there 's no point in watching it . the series is great , stick to the episodes both before and after this dvd . trust me , i know how tempting it is to either rent this episode , get it on netflix , or go out and buy it outright ... but do n't . you 'll only be sorry . there are a myriad of reasons why the company made this dvd ( posted elsewhere ) but what 's important is that it is a waste of time and money . great series ( a+ ) , this dvd = f .
1	it is a tragedy that brandon lee died while making this film . had he lived , the crow sequels would have been much better . the crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace . it set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990 's .
0	take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same . really , is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids ? they deserve better . the key point of this movie is that lying is bad . good point . a device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks . also good . unfortunately , the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible ( even kids will have a hard time believing a man ca n't tell he 's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror ) , and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion , the entire thing falls flat . making films for children is a fine thing . they should n't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children , however . quite honestly , i 'd rather have a kid watch something like `` good will hunting '' before this . do n't waste your children 's time with this film . read them a book ... a good book ... instead
0	the dvd came in a timely manner , packaged well and i have had no problems with the item . it seems to be in great condition

1	john waters is a very brilliant and odd film director . he brings camp , trash , filth , humor and morality to all of his movies , pushes peoples buttons , goes farther than most dare ( and then some ) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance . true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point ! lol ! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies . these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them ( especially a dirty shame ) to broaden their minds a little more . my personal favorites are pink flamingos , a dirty shame , female trouble , polyester and desperate living . serial mom is also a fav but not in this collection . he has come from underground trash to queen of filth , trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold , outlandish , outspoken and bizzar , i applaud you john waters . brillant
1	hard to believe it took me until now ( february 2007 ) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80 's . i loved this movie . it really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting , especially tony montana . a movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is ( over 2 hours ) . everyone must see scarface at least once in their lifetime . it wo n't disappoint . the ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense . watch it now
1	i saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001 , but i did n't pay too close attention , because i forgot about it . however , i remembered seeing it in theaters one day when i was browsing the dvd section , and decided to give it another shot at home . i am so glad i did ! leelee sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film . she has a bright future in acting ahead of her . basically what happens is , ruby ( sobieski ) and her brother rhett 's ( trevor morgan ) parents die in a car accident . their parents wished for them to go live with the family 's former neighbors , the glasses , ( who had since moved to malibu ) played by stellan skarsgard and diane lane . needless to say , ruby and rhett 's carefree lives are changed dramatically . rhett falls for all the gifts that the glasses buy for him , but ruby is n't fooled so easily . she begins to suspect that her parents ' death was n't an accident , and starts to investigate . she sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the glasses that only make her more suspicious . eventually , she figures out that the glasses are behind the car accident and are now after ruby and rhett 's 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents . i wo n't give away the rest , but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second ! rent it , or better yet , buy it ! it 's well worth your while !
0	having just read the book ( most highly recommended ) i decided to treat myself to the movie . i could have cried . while i did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book , i was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around . in the book , the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character . in the movie , they got rid of one man , had the other eaten right off the bat , pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy . in the book , nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters , and he does not have an elaborate home on the island . and what about those stupid giant animals ? i do n't recall reading about them . the fence around nemo 's home looks like it came right from jurassic park . the whole story was about 5 ( eventually 6 ) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there . on another note , the graphics were pretty bad . the panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy . as one reviewer well said , it is suitable for children who are easily pleased , but it is nothing like the book . perhaps this is why amazon sells it for only $ 6.99
1	release the bats is definatly one of my favorite dvds i own . it will show you a side of pete wentz and others you may or may not want to see ... i thought it was very interesting to see and its kind of cool to see another side others may not have . you also get to find out who dirty is or whatever . pete says things about him in a couple of places ( online ) and all i could think is `` who is that ? '' so thats also very exciting . i would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this . remember : its the stuff deemed 'unfit ' for `` my heart with always be the b-side to my tongue

1	crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a true story of three australian soldiers in the boer war accused of killing prisoners and a dutch minister . the british command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the germans , who seem eager to join the war on the side of the boers , to stay out . the men claim they were only following orders , orders which went against `` normal '' military practice . this is a new type of warfare : the boers fought as guerrillas , not in uniform , not by `` the rules . '' the australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms . the morality of war itself , therefore , is just as much on trial as these men . they all lose in the end . the trial scenes are well paced , and the use of flashback creates just the right amount of tension . also there are enough shady gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting . well worth a watch
0	for better or worse , after the relative box-office slump of on her majesty 's secret service , producers brocolli and saltzman decided to woo sean connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum . connery , who had said he would never do another bond film , donated all of his money to his own foundation . while his performance is competent and smooth as ever , he seems all business . no longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant , connery mechanically works his way through diamonds are forever , an outright bore of the bond series and , in my opinion , one of the worst ( certainly connery 's worst ) . while some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the bond genre , it plainly is n't . it was an attempt to return bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers . far from trying to lampoon the bond formula , the producers were trying to resuscitate it . and they failed . after the opening `` gun barrel '' sequence , we quickly find bond on a personal mission to kill blofeld once and for all after the death of bond 's only true wife ( discounting the false marriage in you only live twice ) in on her majesty 's secret service . ( at least , this is what we must assume , since no mention of the marriage is made in diamonds are forever ) . bond catches blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and , after a couple of struggles with both blofeld and a duplicate , bond drowns blofeld in a vat of mud . it is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence . the titles involves various diamonds , slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women , all set to the title song sung by shirley bassey ( who also sang the goldfinger title ) . the plot of diamonds are forever is quite strange . in an opening similar to goldfinger , we learn that large quantities of south african diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet , surprisingly , have not made their way to the market . worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market , bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation , disguised as peter franks . bond quickly succeeds , meeting up with tiffany case ( jill st. john ) , an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of bond 's identity . bond 's mission is almost compromised from the start when the real peter franks makes an entrance , forcing bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in from russia with love . after a smuggling attempt goes awry ( thanks to bond ) , bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating . it turns out that blofeld is behind it all ( bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser ) ! blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on earth . blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse willard whyte ( jimmy dean ) , whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world , and using whyte 's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser . blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in america , russia , and china . the purpose ? blofeld is organizing an international auction , offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder ! will bond be able to stop him in time ? diamonds are forever feels like a film that was stitched together , rather poorly , from a myriad of interesting elements . one feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order . the infiltration of a smuggling ring , the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator , the quirky and gay hitmen mr. wint ( bruce glover ) and mr. kidd ( putter smith ) , a not-so-subtle rendition of the famous las vegas recluse howard hughes , a fight on an oil rig , et cetera . all of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right , but the combination does n't yield what the producers were hoping for . what is it about this film that feels so ridiculous ? one of the major problems , in my opinion , is situating bond in las vegas . bond in america is dull . his class , wit , and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of las vegas in the 1970s . bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations -- not to a strip club . furthermore , the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series . i think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd . the chase is boring , the buggy looks ridiculous and prop-esque , and there is no suspense . the climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring . sure , we have a big set and big explosions . but there is no cutting edge stuff here . connery , as mentioned , looks very tired here . tiffany case is a bit refreshing , but quickly becomes dim-witted and dull . and the bond girl with the clever name , plenty o'toole ( lana wood ) is only in the film for all of five minutes . blofeld is now played by charles gray , who first made his appearance as bond 's japan contact in you only live twice . gray 's performance takes blofeld back to the ridiculousness of you only live twice , even appearing in drag at one point . there is n't much more to say . the acting is dead in diamonds are forever . now , some have tried to defend diamonds are forever by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the bond genre . after producing six bond films , the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move bond into the roger moore pun-fest the series would eventually become . while this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film , it seems plainly false . if you watch the `` making of '' documentary on the ultimate edition , it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real bond flick and not a parody . the producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box-office success . they were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the bond formula . anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization . this film stinks . let 's get over it . ultimately , i think you should skip diamonds are forever . the only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order . it is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between sean connery and roger moore . the ultimate edition does have crisp picture and sound . if you must struggle through the film , make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable . but if you only desire to watch the better bond films , skip it . diamonds may be forever , but this film died a long time ago .
1	i think that anyone who believes this movie to be `` hilarious '' or hudson 's performance `` overrated '' and `` over-the-top '' in her singing just does n't like musicals . or perhaps does n't like an all black cast ( i am not black ) or is too young to understand the 60 's world of music and payola and backstabbing . while touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by the supremes with diana ross as its lead singer , it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others . the key words here are `` loosely based '' on the story of the supremes . why people , including ross herself do n't get that is beyond me ! over the top ? if anyone saw the original play with jennifer holliday ( i did see it ) then you do n't know the meaning of over the top . that character was supposed to be that way and hudson did a wonderful job of that . her performance overrated ? hogwash ! she deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress . murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever ! beyonce 's performance was good but not great . this was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play . this was beyonce 's best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the `` right '' role . this was not the right role for her in my opinion . hudson 's character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the `` supporting actress '' win . though as lead actress she probably would have lost . you people out there , do n't take my word for this movie 's greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was `` white-washed , '' no pun intended . or do n't think its a bad movie like some other critics here . you must judge for yourself . i hope and think that you wo n't be disappointed . there are some more than subtle references to the supremes and diana ross especially in some of the costumes , beyonce 's images and album covers ( cd covers for you youngsters ) but only die hard fans of the supremes and people who were there at that time would know that . enjoy
0	i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i was n't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning . but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much . once he did start playing , gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in . by the time things settle down , the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface . the mix is horrible . the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize , he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out . i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the `` concert experience '' . there are high points in the show , but the low points are rock bottom . comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart . two versions are provided on this dvd - from the concert and in the bonus section . neither of the guest singers ( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff ) know the words , have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before . gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience . the very best thing on this dvd is , oddly enough , in the bonus section . screamin ' jay hawkins ' i put a spell on you , a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland , almost makes the dvd worth buying . almost . watch jonathan demme 's beautiful treatment of neil young : heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show . that is the gold standard .
1	while this dvd was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times , the genius of david bowie shines through . as adults too young to remember or have seen ziggy stardust , it was an amazing look at the time period . the sound quality is suprisingly good , although some camera angles are distracting at times . it was also neat to hear bowie 's pronouncement of `` this is our last tour ever . '' little did he know ... this dvd is worth every penny . rock on
1	i was fourteen years old when i attended the new york premier of this movie at the rivoli theater . i have the original premier book from the theater ; which is not for sale . i immediately fell in love with the beautiful ingrid bergman . so did millions of other young men . this movie did not win the award of the year ; it was overshadowed by `` casablanca '' ; which in my estimation , was of inferior quality , compared to for whom the bell tolls . bob richard
1	i purchased this dvd because it said it was an easier pilates video to do ; basically anyone , even beginners , could do it . i have to disagree . i started this video and tried to do all of the 5 , ten minute sections . it was n't completely hard , but definitely challenging . i am not the most fit person , but also not the most unfit . i had a harder time because i am just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video . i am not saying i would n't suggest it , i am just saying it 's not definitely for beginners . however , the instructions are clear and since it 's broken up into the five-ten minute sections it gets even lazy people like me to get off the couch and do it
1	a wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it . it is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity . as a big fan of greer garson , i must comment on jane bedinger 's review in which she claimed that ms. garson was having an `` affair '' with the actor who played her son . ms. garson fell in love with and married richard ney about a year after the movie was made . i do n't see how ms. bedinger could consider this an `` affair '' .
1	a pure and engaging story of redemption amongst family , `you can count on me ' tells the story of sammy ( laura linney ) and terry prescott ( mark ruffalo ) , siblings who lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still very young . years later and sammy is a single mother of 8-year-old rudy ( rory culkin ) , she works hard at her job at the bank , now run by over critical brain everett ( matthew broderick ) , and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is ( josh lucas has a great cameo as rudy senior ) . when terry shows up after months of no communication sammy is immediately thrilled , but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw-up and is just using her , again . terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend 's abortion , but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with sammy and rudy . over the course of a few weeks terry has made a deep impact , especially in the life of young rudy who idolizes him . this film follows the changes each of these siblings make , changes in themselves but also changes they cause others to make . it 's a beautiful story of redemption and acceptance and it should n't be missed . the performances by the two leads are outstanding , and young rory culkin is adorable and mature as sammy 's son , but the real shock to me was matthew broderick who played the demanding , philandering , unlikable type brilliantly , and he 's not one i 'm generally impressed with
1	i read the various reviews about the movie `` the hunter '' . i was surprised at the extremeties in preference . much like owning a fiero , . . . . which i do . the movie , as is the fiero , is overall slower than most of mcqueen 's . however , he still pulls it off , showing his great acting ability . when you take the character , `` papa '' thorson , he was a different breed in the wrong time era . who else , but mcqueen could make him so realistic ? i have n't seen the movie in several years . i have been wanting a copy to add to my library . i intend to do that today . oh yeah , the relationship between the movie and the fiero ? i have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it . i loved `` the hunter '' and i love my fiero . for those of you who do n't understand , . . . `` sorry '' ! steve mcquen displayed more of his talent , even while ill. god bless you , steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us
1	this exercise video was very easy to get started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited space . this is great for people who do not have alot of room . after exercising to the video , i felt really good , energized . i would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out exercising . it is low impact and easy to follow
1	the star trek collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series dvd collections ( the original series , the next generation , deep space nine , voyager and enterprise ) . at around 1100 minutes per box ( a few hours less than the tos seasons ) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing . that is 1 month of non-stop star trek . no dvd series comes remotely close to that . get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years . by the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe . this is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years . it is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also . our very planet , earth , has advanced because of gene roddenberry 's admirable concept . roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too . `the bridge ' members are like our family . watch what they do . then go and spend your life striving for the same on earth . what engineer , medic , scientist , teacher , worker can not say that star trek has not influenced them ? the show is this significant in the development of our species . even christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why . the dvd case is not quite as fancy as the tos ( the original series ) cases . the tng case is supposed to resemble a tng crew briefcase . the case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve . sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs . there are 4 episodes per disc . however the last disc , disc 7 , only has two episodes , for a grand total of 26 episodes ( tos has 8 discs , 30 episodes ) . the rest of disc 7 is devoted to star trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras ... and then some more . the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed , but in the sequence that they aired , however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in . this means on one disc you have shows 4 , 2 , 12 and 1 , in that order . the sound has also been remastered to 5:1 dolby digital ! since the show was shot in full frame , these dimensions are retained . star trek , the next generation ( tng ) , season one , had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast . an instant hit and a milestone in television serials ( it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3 ) , its characters and new look enterprise had us glued to the tv with the first computer generated images of our solar system as captain picard utters the immortal words ... `to baldly ' ... i mean ... `to boldly go where no man ' ... i mean ... `to boldly go where no one has gone before . ' viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the tos series but is more of the same again ( even remaking some tos episodes ) , this time with more characters , more action and more special effects . season 1 all of the main characters in the tng series are in episode one , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker , lieutenant/lt . commander geordi la forge , lieutenant tasha yar , lieutenant worf , commander dr. beverly crusher , lt. commander/commander deanna troi , lt . commander data and ensign wesley crusher . only natasha yar quits before the first season is finished . commander dr. beverly crusher is replaced by doctor katherine pulaski for season two . ensign wesley crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after season four . the enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing , playing an important function in many episodes . the use of computer generated images ( a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987 ! ) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences , planets , backdrops , an improved bridge main viewer and windows ! advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android . tng season one attempts to relate with tos by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made tos so interesting . the stories ( also written by tos 's dc fontana ) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s , early 90s , when tng first aired . season one of tng is mostly about deities , infections , alien cultures , galactic politics , time travel , alien forces , mind control , family matters , computer malfunctions and starfleet academy . there are also the unforgettable episodes `encounter at farpoint ' which introduces us to the crew of the enterprise and the mysterious q , `where no one has gone before ' a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos , `datalore ' which features two data characters , `heart of glory ' with some in-depth revelations about klingons , `skin of evil ' featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending , and the classic `conspiracy ' ( this episode is uncut , which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [ so parents be cautious ] ) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of starfleet . the bottom line for tng : season one is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out . although we can debate about which is the better series , tng or tos , we still absolutely adore both . we might miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume , but hearing picard saying `make it so ' just makes our day . season 2 season two , still carries on with repeating much of the stories in tos , revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own , boosting data 's screen time , bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres , improved alien cgi and an enhancement in particle effects . they even attempt a type of morphing . most of the main characters from season one are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker ( now with a beard ) , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( letting his hair grow ) , commander deanna troi ( complete with low-cut red starfleet costume ) , lt . commander data and ensign wesley crusher . however obviously commander lieutenant tasha yar is gone but so is dr. beverly crusher ( who was not bad-looking ) , replaced by doctor katherine pulaski ( who looks like your granny ! ) for season two because dr. crusher has been reassigned to starfleet medical as explained in episode one of season three ( in reality the tng writers where having difficulties in developing crusher 's character , would later reinstate her for season three , dropping pulaski because they felt her character was not working ) . colm meaney as miles edward o'brien , navigation from season one gets more screentime , while the new whoopi goldberg chatacter , guinan , is the wise el aurian bartender in 10 forward , the new bar room where the enterprise crew get to relax . except for this extra area the enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more enterprise based than season one , or all of tos , meaning season two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback , but sets a new standards in the `hotel in space ' feel that would produce the `deep space nine ' series . season two of tng is mostly about alien impregnation , mystery space , ai , the holodeck , interplanetary relations , rapid aging , justice , shape-shifting , time travel , family , the prime directive , kidnapping , cloning , war games and infections . the big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with klingons and the first encounter with the borg ! the unforgettable episodes are , `elementary , dear data ' where data takes on his sherlock holmes persona and we are introduced to the moriarty character . `loud as a whisper ' is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator . `a matter of honor ' is where riker serves on a klingon battleship . `q who ? ' may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the borg . the last episode of season two `shades of gray ' may be one of the worst star trek episodes ever , which uses riker 's memories from seasons one and two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the season one episode `conspiracy ' featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [ so parents be cautious again ] ) . the bottom line for tng : season two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down , we get the borg and lots and lots of klingons . at this stage in the saga we might still miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume , but how will picard defeat those assimilating half-man , half-machine entities that are heading his way ? he better `` make it so '' with season three . season 3 it was the dawn of the 90s and since cgi had undergone some development , the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence , but with better looking planets ( complete with moving gaseous atmospheres ) and major enhancements in particle effects . towards the end it undergoes new model development , lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look . the crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker ( now with a bigger belly ) , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( letting his hair grow even more ) , commander deanna troi ( with more makeup , costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [ that really is n't as good as it sounds ] ) , lieutenant commander data and ensign wesley crusher ( new hairdo ) . dr. beverly crusher is back ( initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better ) and doctor katherine pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again . pulaski 's disappearance is not officially explained ( in reality diana muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in l.a. law instead . mcfadden was asked to rejoin the series again ) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with dr. crusher making reference to pulaski 's work in episode four . commander lieutenant tasha yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode ! dwight schultz ( murdoch from the a-team ) makes his first appearance as lieutenant `reg ' barkley , who would have a reoccurring role . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien , navigation , does n't have much of a role boost since season two , while the whoopi goldberg 's guinan character of the wise el aurian , the bartender in 10 forward , has her background further developed . season three of tng is mostly about nanotechnology , colonization , super aliens , the prime directive , orphans , ancient space booby traps , romulans , wormholes , peace negotiations , defectors , super humans , terrorism , q , court inquisitions , parallel universes , ai , klingon high councils , captivity experiments , time travellers , biological space crafts , morale , the first law of robotics , vulcans , sarek , evolutionary speciation , and the borg . unlike season two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters . there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season , `` evolution '' where nanotechnology takes over the enterprise , `` the survivors '' is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet , `` who watches the watchers ? '' is about the prime directive failing when the enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped , `` offspring '' sees data creating another sentient android , `` sins of the father '' has worf return to his klingon homeworld to defend his family honour , `` hollow pursuits '' has lt. barkley fantasizing about crew members in the holodeck , `` sarek '' is about the vulcan of the same name from star trek : the original series , who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation , and of course the pot-boiler end episode of `` the best of both worlds , part i '' ( widely acclaimed as one of the best star trek episodes ever ! ) marks the grand entrance of locutus of borg onto the scene . the bottom line for tng : season three is that it is often cited by fans as the best tng season and is probably the first of the seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets . in season three everyone seems to have matured , included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie , especially towards the end . there is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since j.r. ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that `` the best of both worlds , part i '' would deliver on , meaning every trekie ( and who was n't at this time ) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved . there is no time to loose ! ! ! onto season four . ... . wooosshhhh . season 4 not since j.r. ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that `` the best of both worlds , part i '' would deliver on at the end of season iii , meaning every trekie ( and who was n't at this time ) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved . there was no time to lose ! ! ! onto season four . ... . wooosshhhh ... so here we are . with season three it was the dawn of the 90s and cgi had undergone some development and improvements ( better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres , particle effects , lighting and subspace effects ) . with season three things started to have more of a movie budget look . season four tries to maintain that class . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( who keeps growing that hair ) , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data , dr. beverly crusher and ensign wesley crusher ( now a starfleet officer with full uniform , also departs from tng half way through this season , and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons ) . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien and whoopi goldberg 's guinan . lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for season four such as worf 's lover k'ehleyr , the traveller , k'mpec the klingon leader , duras whose dishonesty caused worf 's discommendation and the romulan tomalak . there is also a surprise character at the end of this season . season four of tng is mostly about the borg , family , dr. soong and the ai emotion chip , adoption , the space-time continuum , hostage rescue , the klingon high council , romulans , alternative universes , holographic projection , survival , loosing special abilities , renegade captains , the devil , amnesia , first contact , love , nightmares , mutations , super intelligence , robin hood , witch hunt trials , euthanasia , host life forms , mind control and honour . like season three most the episodes in season four have great stories , combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did . it is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established . apart from containing part ii of `the best of both worlds ' , the introduction of the cardassians , who would become major players in the star trek : deep space nine franchise , makes it even more valuable . there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season , `the best of both worlds , part ii ' concludes the cliff-hanger from season three with some great battle special effects , `family ' has picard going home to see his brother and family , `brothers ' features dr. soong who is data 's creator , `reunion ' returns to the story of worf and his klingon dishonour , `the wounded ' features the cardassians for the first time , `clues ' has data disobeying picard , `first contact ' sees riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring , the `the nth degree ' has barclay taking control of the enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence , `qpid ' for its historical recreation of robin hood and of course `redemption , part i ' which deals with worf 's dishonour . the bottom line for tng : season four is that it keeps up the pace of season three , and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets . everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want . although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that `` the best of both worlds , part i '' was , `redemption , part i ' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know . we are left asking ourselves , if the `hard man ' is really gone and why does `she ' look like a romulian ! as picard would say `` i can live with a mystery '' but we just ca n't ! onto season five as quick as we can ... season 5 season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects . the display panels on the enterprise are more interactive . the camera can now pan as special effects take place . deep space battles seem more intense . we also get a new star trek title graphic in the opening sequence . the cliff-hanger conclusion of `` redemption , part ii '' is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between klingons , romulans and the federation , turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get . none-the-less , it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of tasha yar . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard ( with a new red suede coat and grey uniform ) , commander william t. riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge ( who sports a new beard in one episode ) , lieutenant commander worf ( who left the enterprise in season four ) , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons ) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren , a bajoran . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien as is whoopi goldberg 's guinan . alexander rozhenko as worf 's son now has a reoccurring role since season four . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) is firmly established as a reoccurring character . watch out for the special appearances of ashley judd as ensign robin lefler and leonard nimoy as spock ! whoot ! whoot ! strangely enough this is the only season where q , of the omnipotent q continuum , does not make an appearance . lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer is also absent from this season . season four of tng is mostly about the klingon high council , romulans , communication , bajora , crystalline entities , disasters , addiction , reunification , time travel , parenting , telekinesis , eugenics , amnesia , possession , euthanasia , sexual repression , time warps , children , cover-ups , sexual attraction , imaginary friends , borg , invisibility , alternative lives and phase shifting . like season four most the episodes in season five have great stories , a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew . it much more of the same as in season four with the better episodes being `redemption , part ii ' , `darmok ' an interesting episode about language , the introduction of the bajora and ensign ro , the silicon avatar makes a return , `unification ' , part i and ii ( both here ) with spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole tng franchise , certainly more popular than `time 's arrow ' , part i which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to data on earth . `the masterpiece society ' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world . huge of borg also makes his first appearance in `i , borg ' . apart from the `unification ' double episode , the instalments `ethics ' , about worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `the game ' , when entertainment becomes mind control , have both achieved cult status as some of the best tng episodes ever aired . season five unfortunately has some dull episodes too , many of which occur in the second half of the season , so the best stuff is within the first four discs . it does n't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with season six , but no doubt because six is as good as five was , then we are there for it . as a note : `` redemption part ii '' - this episode received as 12 age rating in the uk , because it contains klingon ritual head butting . `violations ' also has sexually violent content ( psychic rape ) . parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children . if you are going to move onto season six then you will probably want to know that during season six the crew make contact with deep space nine . so if you get deep space nice : season one you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order . if you are in for six you may also be in for season one of ds9 ! season 6 season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that star trek , deep space nine : season 1 whipped up while season 6 was running . 1993 was tv sci-fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of st for the year . this means for the folks who have been watching tos and tng , now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between tng season 6 and ds9 season 1 . you can find the order if you search the new for it . tng has really good stories while ds9 gets the effects . we are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story . season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises ( picard acting like a russian is hysterical . would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time ? maybe yes ! ) . the conclusion of `` time 's arrow '' is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons ) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren , a bajoran . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien but will be transferred to ds9 ( his absence is not mentioned ) . whoopi goldberg 's guinan is back along with alexander rozhenko . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) will also leave for ds9 . lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer is back after being absent from season 5 . season 6 of tng is mostly about transporter psychosis , empaths , scotty ! , alien abductions , q , age regression , android dreams , artificial life , cardassians , prof. moriarty , love , romulan defection , destiny , klingon birthrights , thieves , command ethics , origins of life , insanity , murder , faith , doubles , time travel and the borg . like season 5 most the episodes in season 6 have above average sci-fi stories , combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew . memorable episodes include , a fistful of datas , the quality of life , ship in a bottle , face of the enemy , birthright and lessons . there are three very good episodes which really make the season worth . tapestry sees picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart . suspicion is a great whodunit episode ( of which there are a few ) with one of the coolest star trek aliens ever ( should have made him a main character ) . descent part i is a very nice slight of hand trick . you will keep thinking hugh right up until the last second . season 7 star trek : season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion , making way for some star trek films , but in reality it is deep space nine : season 2 ( ds9 : season 1 starts in star date chronological order with tng : season 6 ) that is the new trek . fans of star trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional sf tv era . the conclusion of `` descent , part ii '' has the finale of lore . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t. riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons ) returns for one episode . while ensign ro laren , a bajoran , was supposed to replace him , she only appears in one episode in season 7 , although the episode is a major one focused on her . colm meaney shows up again as miles edward o'brien for the last episode . whoopi goldberg 's guinan is gone without explanation ( see the movie `` star trek : nemesis '' on her ) . alexander rozhenko is back . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) is not here either ( after leaving for ds9 ) . lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer , is back again . season 6 of tng is mostly about lore , emotional studies , interfaces , mercenaries , nightmares , psychic trauma , beverly and picard , warp travel environmental damage , data 's mother , alternate realities , the pegasus , worf 's human brother , incubus , top secret missions , radiation sickness , deities , troi and worf , reverse evolution , wesley and the traveller , klingon right of ascension , picard 's son , abiogenesis , ro laren and time travel . while there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one ( `` masks '' for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise ) most are well above average and some are incredible . memorable episodes include , gambit , forces of nature , inheritance , lower decks , thine own self , journey 's end and bloodlines . the pegasus is probably the best episode of the season , but the finale `` all good things ... '' is really where it is at with some good aging effects , a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic enterprise to die for . the series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek . in short there is nothing like st : tng . it evolved tv serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years . it set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars . all we can say about this awe-inspiring series can be summed up in one word ... ... amen .
1	bob clark 's 1974 chiller classic , which went on to inspire many elements of `` halloween '' and `` when a stranger calls '' , is definitely one of the better , if not best , horror films out there . period . not high on blood , but very high on suspense , dread , atmosphere , and out-of-the-dark surprises . a sorority house ( to include the lovely olivia hussey , the vulgar alcoholic margot kidder , and sctv vet andrea martin ) falls victim to vicious , violent , and altogether menacing phone calls during the christmas holidays . soon , students on campus begin turning up missing . though some events do go unexplained ( which could be positive , considering the mystery involved ) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts , this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films , with the most tense , moody photography ever captured on film . keir dullea and margot kidder turn in quite effective performances . highly recommended
1	2 fast 2 furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that does n't require you to have seen the original . i saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out , and having never seen the original , i thought i would be lost and would n't enjoy myself as much as other people , but on the contrary - i left the experience much happier than when i came in . this film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh . the special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open . i have heard and read that people did n't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races , but overall , i think the balance works well . even thinking of the plot that we are left with , i really ca n't see another time when a race would even be appropriate . and as for people saying that this film is worse than the original , i would have to disagree ... why ? frankly , i have always been a firm believer than vin diesel is entirely overrated as an actor . ( i mean , c'mon - have you seen the pacifier ? ) he 's nothing more than a meat head who , while able to do pretty good fight scenes , should leave the dialogue to someone else . yes , this film is for the younger crowd , and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take the boat jumping as an example ) , but there is no saying that an older person would n't enjoy it as well ... the only thing that i will say is that you really should n't go into this film expecting an oscar worthy performance , or else you will be disappointed . if you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is , however , you will thoroughly enjoy yourself
0	this movie has a good plot , great acting , and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life . i did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other , but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos , the profanity , the undermining of parental authority , and the lack of closure concerning landon 's journey to faith . it is evedent that this movie is directed to a less-than-mature-audience . i saw more bad in it than good , which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie
1	this is without a doubt , one of harrison fords greatest moments . an incredible film with some of the best visual effects i 've ever seen . very dramatic with a lot of suspense . a very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view . a film you will want to see again and again . action , mystery , drama , thriller . there are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such , but they do n't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama . i highly recommend it
0	do n't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity . if you do , you are in for a fall . both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining . this one has no such pretensions . it is merely boring . the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town 's folk out of their claims . they do this through intimidation and violence . when a couple of friends get hold of a claim , they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys . to do this , they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction . they yell , they fight , they wrestle , they shoot and then they do it some more . its not very exciting cinema . this production is made worse by the dvd . i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair . the dvd , however , is of such low quality that who could really tell ? the edges are clipped off , the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it . it was not worth the effort . spaghetti westerns can be fun . this one , however , needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn .
0	maybe i loved the original one too much , but this version of the story did not work for me . i especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas . stick with the first one . it was perfect
0	not what i expected when renting this movie . as others have said clarissa came off too pure and innocent . futhermore , i do n't understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world ? everyone knows what lovelace has done..there are numerous accounts . yet she goes with him anyway ? blah . the acting was ok . the costumes were excellent ( i love period movies ) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged . and as another put it , i was very glad when clarissa kicked the bucket . i read a lot of historical fiction , classic novels and love period movies , but there was no liking this one . it just couldnt be done
1	this was an easily understandable view of the complex structure of the universes held by modern physics . it is found facinating by the common man .
1	this dvd is amazing ! perfectly puts the blues on display through the high-points and the low points of the season . the best thing about this dvd , besides the flying , is the respect they show the crew . yeah , the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff , but , they are faaaar from the stars of the show ! the maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide . this dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do . they truly go through the mill , but , they do n't do a single thing with those blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly . this is finally a dvd that shines the light on the pilots , but , makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots . great job ! ! ! unlike the retired one who reviewed also ( great review by the way ! ! ! ! ) , i would not like to be a pilot after seeing this ! i would rather get faaar more reward working in my support role and knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to do the work allows it
1	great movie and the movie a family can set and enjoy and not worry about the next word or scene may hold
1	the scene where eric idle whines `` oh , you 're no fun anymore ! '' is a deceptive one . if anything , these guys are even more fun than before . the second half of monty python 's flying circus 's first season is even more polished and mad than the first , continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity . in these episodes , we have : a serial-killer barber ; lecherous art critics ; an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral , tunnel to java and jump the english channel ; ken shabby , every girl 's dad 's nightmare ; thuggish old ladies ; bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla ; camel-spotting ; and prime ministers falling through the earth 's crust . the longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into scotsmen and streaming north of the border . soon `` scotland will be choked with scotsmen , '' and england is pretty much abandoned . the culprits : tennis-playing , human-devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of andromeda . and , of course , the stuff that has become comedy legend : the scene where john cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store ( `` it 's a stiff ! bereft of life , it rests in peace ! `` ) , and the lumberjack song ( `` i cut down trees . i skip and jump/i like to press wild flowers/i put on women 's clothing/and hang around in bars ... '' ) . of course , no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these dozens of skits . these five brits ( and one american , who did the little cartoons ) created some of the most unabashed , naughty , nasty , and just plain weird comedy ever , which still influences everything from saturday night live to author jasper fforde . and all of this by men who often dress up as the world 's most unattractive girls , with only a tiny budget and minimal cast . the 70s production values are omnipresent , and they are decidedly unpolitically correct . but in a weird way , these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure , raw , unrefined comedy . probably the most memorable actors here are cleese and idle . cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone , as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice . and eric idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber , while michael palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane . by this point , the monty python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance . in other words , it 's funny and should be watched
1	cast : denzel washington , john goodman , donald sutherland , embeth davidtz , james gandolfini , elias koteas , gabriel casseus , michael j. pagan . running time : 123 minutes rated r for violence and language . `` fallen '' starts with convicted serial killer edgar reese ( elias koteas ) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice detective jon hobbes ( denzel washington ) looks on . hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named muscovich ( glen witko ) in a bathtub having been poisoned , the same way reese used to kill his victims . at first hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name robert milano comes up , a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide . hobbes speaks with his daughter gretta ( embeth davidtz ) who at first is reluctant to speak with him . things become even stranger when the man who killed muscovich , charles ( robert joy ) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again . eventually gretta tells hobbes the truth , he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch . the demon azazel seems to be taunting hobbes , ruining his life career , setting him up for murder getting to his friends family . hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him everyone he cares about . charismatic leading man denzel washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range , while john goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to james gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character . donald sutherland does n't prove to have any range , doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies . embeth davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress . she delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future . the directing and camera work in this movie was superb . it was done in such a way where you can see azazel 's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town . although this film does require your full attention , it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours . `` fallen '' is an intelligently written , supremely efficiently executed , and one of the most unheralded , unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade . one of the better of its kind
0	gene hackman is jedidiah tucker ward , an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good , enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere . on the other side of this gap of good and evil is maggie ward , jed 's headstrong daughter . between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people . the premise suggests the ending - jed will win the day , but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney . jed will fight the good fight ( which will require supreme grandstanding ) while maggie learns just how amoral her side really is . what robs this courtroom thriller is what 's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way , an actual case in controversy . maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture , hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them . instead of a compelling case , we have one that 's ready for our verdict as soon as we 've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices . the case in `` class action '' is one you can typify as `` david goliath '' , which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power . there 's no way that we 're going to see a case won ( even by dishonest means ) by donald moffat 's hired band of harvard-trained professional liars , and there 's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments . maggie 's bosses are so transparently bad , that not only do they screw up , but even their explanations are patently evil even so , the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery , and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless . for a thriller about high-paid lawyers , `` class action '' has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial , with fewer suprises
0	cool band . worst videos ever . ever . makes me like them less . fearless freaks is good . this is garbage ...
0	this dvd is very cheesy and i am sorry i bought it .
1	this movie has more magic than a wand . this movie is a story about having faith in your beliefs . young jessica is so sure that this reindeer is prancer she is willing to go to extremes to help save her friend . sam elliot plays a tough dad who wants to have faith in his only daughter but is scared of losing her and his farm . this a wonderful classic for the young and old .
1	this dvd contains all of the original ben stiller show episodes , plus an extra un-aired episode . the show was not only far ahead of its time , but also timeless as is evidenced by stiller 's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the tv series . for anyone who was a fan of the tv series or stiller 's movies , this dvd is a must
1	this was the first dvd i purchased after i bought my dvd player ( i know , it took me a while to get one ) . i had never seen the movie before , but amazon [ .com ] reccomended it so i took the chance . it had the perfect amount of predictability and comedie and romance . it 's the same story line that gets used a million times and never grows old . boy and girl are best friends . girl likes boy , but boy likes a different girl . boy asks for help from girl to get the other girl . boy realizes he 's in love with friend girl just in time to stop her from leaving
1	the story of nasa 's sucessfull failure ! ! ! this movie is base on jim lovell 's book lost moon , the title coming from the fact that every other astronuat that went to the moon the first time would walk on it the second . lovell is the only man to circe it both times he went there ! what makes this film so realistic is that dave scott ( 7th man out of 12 to walk on the moon ) was technicial advisor on the film . i 've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released , and watching the film i 'd say to myself that this is about the time that xxx happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did ! look quick at the very end of the movie for the real jim lovell , he 's the navy captian with gray hair shaking t. hanks hand ! see the imax version last . several scenes have been edited out
1	`` lagaan '' is a masterpiece . the setting , the music , the full range of singing , the craving for love , - all provide stimulating background for the depth of a plot which portrays a strong young man , with failth in himself , and his refusal to be ground under by external forces beyond his control . you , the reader , must step up to the wicket , sooner than you may realize , and defend the slim sticks of your belief in defense of the innate dignity of mankind .
0	i collect 1950s era sci-fi and i have been replacing my vhs versions with dvds . unfortunately , i need to keep my vhs version for this movie because the print that image entertainment made this from was in such poor shape . the vhs version by uav entertainment ( the wade williams collection ) is much better . hopefully , uav will come out with a dvd version soon
1	jewish soles trying to avoid the devil 's brigade ( hitler 's killing machine ) ... . sad , but oh so funny and cute in sections that alas , maybe only the jewish people would truly understand . i found it all of these things but with love , warmth to the end
0	this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying the gospel of john beautifully through the movie - and slapping yahushua/jesus and serious scholars in the face with the other hand . the so-called `` scholarly '' comments , for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events , are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate . even the lowliest of bible scholars , if honest , will realize this . it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible , while trying to tear it down at the same time . the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rd dvd . i gave the movie to a relative without that add on
1	this was a great movie for me because my daughter did this dance routine in a school production 15 years ago and we both wanted to see the movie over and over again
0	wow , this was awful ! the best thing about this dvd is that it does n't last long . my boyfriend and i sat down to watch this together ( in the mood to begin with ) and both of us were completely turned off by it . the woman is not even naked , and wears a nightie throughout the dvd . she also is extremely hairy ( a matter of personal taste i know , but this was very extreme ) . the tone of it was decidedly unsexy , more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher ( s ) . it seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative . spend your money on something else if you 're looking for sexual excitement..
1	i watched 7 out of 8 episodes in two days . it may be educational for people who did n't know much about it , but if you are somewhat familiar with the topics , this documentary film did n't offer much more
0	awful ... truly awful . joanne sellar and daniel lupi ( producers of boogie nights and hard eight ) should be ashamed of themselves and so should the weinsteins for producing this piece of crap
0	with the new year just more than six hours away , i must tell you that no matter a full moon , half moon , quarter moon , or no moon at all , please avoid the flick `` darkwolf '' for many moons to come . what a joke . what a silly , stupid , insult to one 's intelligence . the script could have been written by my dog stan ... and even then , i give him the benefit of the doubt to come up with something much more canine . let 's put it this way . have you ever seen a film that contained people that irritated you so much , you simply did n't give a ^^ % * if they got blown away ? i was hoping the entire cast got mulched by mr. wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser . go `` darkwolf '' . take a few chucks out of this cast , its director , producer , writer and editors as quickly as possible ... and do n't wait until the next full moon . `` darkwolf '' is an insult to motion pictures . more so , it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as `` the wolf man '' , `` wolfen '' and `` the howling '' , not to mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic `` an american werewolf in london '' . need i say more ? `` darkwolf '' has no bite . it 's claws and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion . the box claims this flick to be `` half man . half wolf . pure evil . '' in reality it is half/whole stupid . half/whole worthless . ... and ... pure ^ % * ! get my drift ? at midnight ... as we turn another page and the new year unfolds ... i promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of `` mary hartman , mary hartman '' , much more than `` darkwolf '' . i 'm off to watch yet another new year 's flick before dawn . i need to make amends to lon chaney , jr. before midnight . bottom line , it was a film you did n't really care `` where '' the `` wolf '' came from , or where the werewolf was going . pitiful ... embarrassing ... '' i 've seen the bad moon rising '' but this one makes me wish it would set !

0	while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid-summer weather . we ended up renting `` analyze that '' and boy , what a mistake that was ! we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999 's `` analyze this . '' the potential was there , it 's not as if writers ( of course it 's never a good sign to see numerous writers ) peter tolan , peter steinfeld , and harold ramis did n't have decent material to work with ; robert deniro , billy crystal , lisa kudrow , and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy . however , this being hollywood and all , another sequel was botched . it 's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation . despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some `` fish out of water '' situations , the movie seemed to go downhill soon after . the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as `` crossroads . '' now either they ran out of jokes , they did n't have enough time to invest in an actual story , or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already ( `` the sopranos '' , `` the whole 9 yards '' , `` mickey blue eyes '' , etc . etc . ) , that there was simply nothing left to write about
0	the book from alex haley when i read it some 10 years ago changed my life and views of people with color , and everyone should read it , yes even conservatives , manditory . however , this movie something just wasnt good . to long ? the over all acting ? spike , you make some great movies , summer of sam is one of your best , do the right thing . spike has a gift for cinematography , however spike lee interview on espn ? the interview said , interviewer : `` kanye west said that bush does n't care about black people . would you agree with that ? lee : `` yes , i agree with that , but i 'll go one step further and say that bush does n't care about people who do n't have any money ( whether they 're black or white . ) i guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on long island or let 's say the hamptons , you would have had an entirley different response from fema and his administration . '' but you should have seen how he said it , it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face . the dude is bold man , i 'll give him that and i applaude him . spike said either black , white , mexican , or asian . but what he did n't say was italians ! ! that dude has been getting flack forever for his dis'n of italians in his movies , they call him a racist all the time . here was his chance to say something , and he blew it . just did n't happen to say italians ? no so he is a racist too . and so are the africans in africa , they never have liked white people either , so what about that spike ? try going over their and applying for a job ! and while i am at , the african americans in even baton rouge do n't want the blacks from n.o . coming up their ! how come spike never said anything about that ? fkn whiners , so many the world over ! give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on tv and let the world see it for the fools they are . and ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling da truth
0	i live in colorado , one of the states that receives emergency funding because the illegal alien situation has gotten so out of hand . this movie is about a town called farmingville and the disruptions in their lives as they ( literally ) wake up to find mass groups of illegals outside of their neighborhoods . some live 20 to a house and have cars coming and going every day- ( imagine how that would bring down the resale value on a home ? ) the aliens surround the streets to hustle for work right out in the open . the video documents the two sides ( the ones who support , and oppose ) the situation . the side that opposes the intrusion into their lives painfully reveals their exasperation at their own city 's inability to instill order and law . as women who go to the neighborhood 7/11 are whistled at , they become nervous ( as a women offered in the video-unfortunetly it was not shown ) . the thick misogyny in the mexican aliens was especially disturbing ( example : a women who was with a special interest gruop to offer services to the illegal men was unsure whether they would listen to her , as in the mexican culture ) . some create groups in support , others create and claw for order . eventually a town meeting is called in which one of the women who runs the opposing group is called a rascist by her own politicians as he is flanked by two illegal aliens who nod in agreement . it is especially poignant to watch as this everday american women brings the situation to her counsil members . they call her a rascist , and many of the illegal aliens surround this politician in support.it was disturbing to see a foreign lawbreaker have more influence over our politicians than one law-abiding women and her attempts at trying to instill order in her own town . i do n't believe it portrayed the opposing townspeoples side very fairly . they had every right to be exasperated-our we not in a terror war ? since when does mexicos problems come before our own ? maybe because it was made by carlos sandaval it was more unobjective . i felt the film more unfairly depicted the opposing ( against illegal immigrants ) as 'mean ' rather than literally mindblown and aggravated their laws were n't being enforced ! when does the nations people not have a voice in their own country ?
0	do n't buy the directors cut . badder santa is absolutely hysterical . for some strange reason the director decided to make a `` director 's cut '' that is a neutered version of `` badder santa '' . i bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from billy bob in the first scene was missing . the celebration in the bar after the first mall `` heist '' , where billy bob proclaims he 's giving up drinking , was missing . the next scene where billy bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing . that was enough for me . i immediately shut it off and best buy agreed to let me swap it for `` badder santa '' due to the false impression of a `` longer and fuller '' cut than it 's predecessor , as is the industry standard . i was duped . please buy `` badder santa '' instead . this is a watered down/walmart version of a classic , not an extended cut
0	i am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio . i would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that i have enconter with two copies of this dvd . the first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement . so amazon promptly shipped out another . the second copy did n't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the exact same place as the first . annoying ! i am currently waiting on another copy , but if it 's bad i 'm giving up . *important* consumers , take my review very seriously because i suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the dvd , they 're just fans of the film . and what an awesome film it is
1	with season 4 the series starts to slide a little . i do n't think the show is weaker , it 's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already ? look , i love the godfather one and two , but three is just not as good . the total time it takes to watch the first two godfather films is a little over 5 hours ! that wo n't even get you through season one of the sopranos . i hope i speak for everyone out there when i say that as good as the sopranos is , it will never come closed to the godfather movies . so i guess it is just starting to get old . i will certainly be watching the finale episodes , i just hope it is n't too big a let down . for those who are interested the dvd set has great transfers , but few interesting extras
0	let me accept the fact that lotr is my most beloved film and i already own the extended editions of the films in one set ! i 'm really not surprised to see new line coming up with another edition of the trilogy . with films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can ! ! still , inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped costa botes documentaries , my advise to anyone buying lotr for the first time is- do not buy this set ! spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 dts ex glory , alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you 'll spend rest of your life watching ! ! please be aware , these new editions do not contain dts tracks , no commentary tracks by the director , weta workshop or the cast . all you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc ... and nothing else . it would have been a better idea had new line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again ... .and even this is not the end , once the hd format gains a little more acceptance , they 'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy ! beware , extended edition set is the ultimate lotr experience , in terms of films or bonus features . go get it ... its worth all the money spent !
0	why ? because it has good sound dts hd 5.1 master lossless audio the picture quality will not blow you away it just seams flat and washed out and this just isnt a good movie i like tim burton and mark wahlberg but this movie was done wright the first tim
1	francis ford coppola 's apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking . it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker . the art direction , editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable . what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline , acting and inner message . the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell , or in other words , hell is war . not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art . european filmmakers would n't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war . what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film 's collaborators through the continuance of the film . the plot is fairly simple and brief , adapted by joseph conrad 's heart of darkness . martin sheen plays the role of captain willard , a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore . he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz ( marlon brando ) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle . throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences . the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks . robert duvall 's character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain : to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself . the children walk about the playground , oblivious to any danger . the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea ; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water , we hear the helicopter 's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack . throughout the sequence we hear wagner 's 'ride of the valkyries ' . it is method filmmaking . the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie ; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing . let 's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in , stop an innocent upcoming boat , suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries . then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity . this film has its famous moment , some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen . it does n't require any intellectual understanding , although the film is intellectually remarkable . the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country , aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against . it was a war gone mad , like all other wars , without purpose or dignity . it was a pure act of humanity : to destroy and restore their own greedy needs . this is a film in which there is no saviour , where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed , anger , foolishness and egoism . as coppola once said about the film : 'this film is n't about vietnam . this film is vietnam ' . he was right to the date . during the current situations of the world , where they are trying to protect their own skin , the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent . it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation . it asks for realism . enjoy
0	this might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer . there is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property . even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of tarantino 's `` kill bill '' films , his salute to the genre , or `` reservoir dogs , '' which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence . `` bullet ... '' is little more than two hours of broken glass , fire , blood squirts , amputation , beatings and explosions . this makes gladiator look like a sunday school picnic . the characters are totally flat , one-dimensional . there is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc . the acting is weak , static , despite the fact that i do n't understand a word of cantonese . we are presented with a series of stereotypes ( the hooker with a heart of gold , the good friend , the crazy friend and the bad friend ) . unfortunately the american stereotype of the viet cong as madmen -- and saigon as hopelessly corrupt -- is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of viet nam during the american occupation . the worst thing is that -- because they are so shallow and undeveloped -- you do n't care what happens to the characters . so i 'll tell you and then you wo n't have to finish watching the film : they kill each other . my advice -- skip it
1	well , season 5 for me was a little bit of a dissappointment but still contain the character plot line ( or the theme as many will call it ) of southpark itself . since buying this i watched it alot in the first month or two then dropped off . my interest in southpark was revisited with season 6 ( also available on dvd ) however , if you like south park or love it this is for you of course without saying . however , if you just joining in you might want to get the package with the first 5 seasons all together , but this season was good
1	this movie was much better than `` vanilla sky . '' `` vanilla sky '' mostly copied `` open your eyes '' but was too obvious and less convincing . ( and tom cruise , though good in some roles , did n't fit this role well . ) `` open your eyes '' takes a little longer to draw you in , but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where `` vanilla sky '' does . also , the jungian dream aspect in `` vanilla sky '' is poorly done , whereas `` open your eyes '' represents the dream experience very well . i recommend watching both movies before you buy one . but if you 're going to buy , get `` open your eyes .
1	the special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period -- there 's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done . doris and perry como 's duet together was ok ( but perry seemed to not like doris flirting with him . ) doris day has always been under-rated as a singer . her voice is sheer perfection . it 's too bad that doris did n't do more specials or have a variety/comedy/musical show like carol burnett .

1	this is my first review for amazon . i 've always felt that the reviews that i read were adequate to represent the movies and anime that i liked . not this time . i have an extensive collection of anime . everything from the really silly stuff , filled with fan service , to the very serious classics that so many fans rave about . i 'm not really into the mecha thing , though i do have a lot of it . it 's the animation first that drives my interest , then its the story and the character development are close seconds . appleseed has all that i 'm looking for in an anime , and in spades . great characters , a well crafted plot , and some of the best animation i have ever see . to say , as some reviewers have , that the movement in this version are unnatural , is more than unfair , it 's just not true . all action is extremely lifelike , and the action scenes are the best i 've ever seen . i actually found myself reversing the disc to rewatch some action repeatedly , something i never do . i 've owned this version of appleseed a few weeks now , and i have watched it at least five times , and am looking forward to another veiwing soon . i have relied on amazon reveiws to decide whether or not to buy anime in the past , so i hope that this reveiw is helpful . there is a lot of good anime worth investing in , and this one is near the top of my list
1	my first favorite television series was `` twelve o'clock high '' and i had at least two models of the `` memphis belle '' when i was kid , all of which simply reflects the fact that the b-17 flying fortress is my favorite airplane . when i was a kid my family was driving through california and there was a b-17 parked out on somebody 's front lawn on a ranch and for years i tried to figure out how to go back and see it . a couple of decades later one of the few b-17s still flying came to the zenith city and i finally got to go inside one ( this big bombers are a lot smaller than i ever thought ) . for all i know that particular b-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film `` memphis belle . '' when i had occasion to drive through the city of memphis , of course i made a point of visiting mud island where the `` memphis belle '' was on display ( she was moved to the air force museum in dayton , ohio this october ) . the `` memphis belle '' ( serial no . 41-24485 ) was one of 12,750 b-17 flying fortresses built by the boeing aircraft company , but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over hitler 's europe without losing a crew member . the idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of american combat flights over europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down . the `` belle '' flew from november 7 , 1942 to may 17 , 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by michael caton-jones ( `` scandal '' ) from the script by monte merrick ( `` staying together '' ) . that simply means that besides the fact that the `` memphis belle '' was named for a lady friend ( margaret polk ) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same ( designed by the famous artist george petty ) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission , which was over lorient , france and not bremen , germany ( the `` belle '' flew there on its 21st mission ) . the names of the crew are all changed and i think the same applies to the plane 's mascot , a scotty dog named `` stuka . '' so if you want something closer to the `` true '' story of the pilot robert morgan and the `` memphis belle '' you want to check out william wyler 's 1944 documentary `` the memphis belle : a story of a flying fortress . '' what you have here instead is a hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in world war ii by incorporating a wide variety of clichés from war movies involving airplanes . then there is the whole idea that americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the nazis . so it is we have the young and recognizable faces of matthew modine as the business like pilot , eric stoltz as the poetic radio operator , tate donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home , d.b . sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up , billy zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight , sean austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret , reed edward diamond as the flight engineer , courtney gains and neil giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners , and harry connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner . back at the base david strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and john lithgow is the public relations officer the army has sent to celebrate the final mission of the `` belle . '' of course , it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the `` memphis belle '' is remembered for completing that final mission , so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run ( the film might play better if it simply inspired by the `` belle '' and they changed the name of the aircraft as well ) . but even if the `` belle '' survives there are other several b-17 crews on the mission who will not . still , the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated , allowing modine 's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that americans do not believe in collateral damage . but what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that donovan 's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else 's job .
1	this is a great collection . i can remember every saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on . it 's truly a great dvd that not only i can enjoy , but my son is hooked on it now too
1	this movie is truly wonderfully done . i appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters , and the deep resonances of director zhang yimou 's commentary on academics in modern rural china . the language is particularly good for students learning mandarin chinese , as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken chinese in the countryside and in the cities . there are english subtitles for beginners as well . i highly recommend it .
1	david lean 's `` the bridge on the river kwai '' like jean renoir 's `` grand illusion '' is an anti-heroic war film , set in a prisoner of war camp environment ... but there , the point of resemblance came to an end ... `` the bridge on the river kwai '' is an adventure film in which the nature of world war ii is explored ... and if in `` grand illusion '' the characters were described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity , in `` the bridge on the river kwai '' they are forced to carry out their destinies by an officer who can not bear to see his bridge blown up ... escape is almost impossible from the japanese camp located near the kwai river in burma ... the prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards ... the camp commander is a rigid psychopath ... conditions are hard to bear ... psychological state of the war british prisoners in constant alteration ... into the presumptuous situation comes colonel nicholson ( alec guinness in a fascinating performance ) , a strict , serene , dedicated british officer , deeply concerned for the welfare of his men ... nicholson is under severe pressure from the stubborn japanese colonel saito ( sessue hayakawa ) for insisting on his attachment to the geneva convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the construction of the strategic bridge ... nichilson survives the oppressive punishment imposed on him , but his obsession has risen to near-madness ... he agrees to help the japanese build their bridge , and in his determination to find victory in defeat , he ignores that the bridge , which he insists must be a 'proper bridge , ' will serve the japanese objectives against the british troops ... in addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp picture , captors against captives and an interesting moral respect to a military code , a third element , in the story , is introduced : a small commando team led by major warden ( jack hawkins ) and an american sailor ( william holden ) whose mission is to destroy the strategic bridge.. the film leads swiftly to a suspenseful climax : a japanese train and a commando force directed to a same goal , the brige of the river kwai ... each character , in the motion picture , has a valid reason for what he is doing , and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge revealed to be obsession and insane ... `` the bridge on the river kwai '' hits with 'war ' in a compelling logic of events , the indulgence of self-destruction . with a great visual beauty and terrific whistling tune march , `` the bridge on the river kwai '' is a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men ...
1	this is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl . it is better than the average for this genre due to several factors . mostly , it is because is well done . the subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here . instead , the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy . the time of the film is the 50s . society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will . in this case , the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen . he is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on `` the nice girl '' . meanwhile , the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek . the geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits . the loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special . the unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch . everyone winds up happy except the town bully/rich boy . it is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that . kelly preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off . doug mckeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself . catherine mary stewart is the nice girl that i wish had lived next door to me and jami gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle . the cast is rounded out by chris nash . each does a good job in the role . teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results . it was fun and bittersweet in the memories it conjured .
0	these 2 guys playing harry and lloyd were so disastrous . they did n't even know how to act corny when they 're supposed to . jim carrey might be crazy at times but i do n't think he 's this bad . the whole thing looked like monkeys flying around the screen . nevertheless , it has some funny moments like when jessica 's parents found all the poo sticking all over the toilet . the whole idea of a 'special class ' was just so stupid . nothing made sense . i did n't see a single point of the whole plot in the first place just to get a little extra cash . the first one was a lot better than this one . jim carrey and jeff daniels were a lot dumber and a lot funnier . these 2 were worse than dumb and were n't even funny at all . i guess 'dumb and dumberer ' would be better if it were still jim carrey and jeff daniels starring but nooo , it had to be these 2 who i do n't even know . please do n't watch it guys . it may be funny for some guys but it 's mostly corny like kindergarteners gone wild . watch the first one ! ! ! kirstie mabita
0	this is the worst transfer to dvd i 've ever seen ! ! ! i think the vhs copy looks and sounds better , do not waste your money ! !
0	a woman who lives in an apartment in nyc and ca n't cook and does n't have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about . ( she writes a very popular domestic advice column . ) she succeeds , until a navy hero wins the opportunity to spend christmas with her in her house in connecticut , enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby . problem is , she does n't have any of those things . she borrows the house ( from a man who wants to marry her ) , she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house , and she even borrows a baby . the unmaking beings when she tells the navy man her child is a boy , and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it 's really a girl . then the mother of the baby takes it back , and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one . then the woman is falling in love with the navy man ( and he with her ) while the man from whom she 's borrowed the house still believes she 's going to marry him , and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding . it 's a delightful movie . very funny , and rich in both plot and character development . unfortunately , what probably makes it not a classic by today 's standards , it is a bit plodding . it does not move at the same pace as , for example , the movie casablanca , with which it shares some of the same supporting actors
0	i was so excited when this dvd came out hoping to get the four pittsburgh steelers highlight films from the '70s . 98 % of all this material is already included in the super bowl collection sets put out last year on dvd . why wo n't nfl films step up and give us more ? ? ? this should be a steeler-specific box set , not some rehash of the entire season for all teams ... come on steve sabol ; give us what we want ! !
0	first of all , this is not the worst movie ever made , nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars . the worst movie ever made was `` autumn in new york '' , but that is a different review . no , this not a great movie , but it is very interesting . and for once , thank god , it does n't end with everything tied up in a pretty hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone . it has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie . and the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie , bleak . more interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack , this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing . for molly ringwald , she did n't do anything of note again until `` the stand '' six years later , and for andrew mccarthy , well it could be argued that he still has n't starred in anything of note again ( although he probably made some money from `` weekend at bernies '' i ii ) . anyway , probably better to rent than buy , i am only buying it to complete my 80 's collection .
1	if you want to see lena heady 's breasts exposed , this is the film to watch . but besides the numerous unnecessary topless scenes ( which are n't too bad ) this film is very intriguing ... the human spirit tries to break through walls of addiction , frustration and isolation ... now is n't that what a `` suspense '' drama should be about
1	these days i want laughter in my life and katt williams gives it to you in the pimp chronicles . i thought kat williams live was great , but this one was better ! his tell it like it is and living life approach is great . if you ca n't go to see him in a live performance this is the next best thing . be prepared to laugh so hard your sides ache . keep an open mind and go for the ride !
1	this movie was probably the best one next to lucario and the mystery of mew and jirachi wish maker . pokemon ranger centers around the legendary pokemon manaphy and of course ash and his friends . some new and amazing characters include buizel , jackie the ranger , mantyke , and chatot the annoying but funny pokemon . the villian is great , the ending is amazing , and the effects were the best yet
0	i was a bit disappointed in this tape . the workouts are too easy . i had mastered abs of steel i and was looking for abs of steel 2 . i could n't find it so i bought this one but its too easy . i found a used abs of steel 2 and i like it much better
1	loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around . two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries . very funny and moving - yes , i 'm a romantic ! it 's awesome !
0	i do n't want to spoil this movie for others and i wo n't . cache is french for hidden and alot was left hidden . why does the son suddenly do what he did ? why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she 's doing ? i did n't care one bit about any of the charactors . this is a slow going movie with no conclusion . if you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry , flip a coin . i watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most us made films . not this one .
1	i saw transamerica months ago and i still think about it . there are many reasons , most obviously felicity huffman 's portrayal of bree , a man determined to become a woman , trying to close the door on his past , just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child . but transamerica also brings a funny , poignant , and at times visually beautiful road trip across the united states , in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles , let alone 3000 . it brings unexpected and uncertain romance . it brings out humanity in all its characters ( save one minor one ) , including bree 's bitter mother . finally , it -- plot spoiler here -- concludes with tentative reconciliation , acceptance , and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future . transamerica is not loud , not big budget , not spectacular , but there are few movies near as good as it .
1	it takes an hbcu graduate to write about the hbcu experience , period . just look at `` a different world '' and how bad the first season was . debbie allen ( a howard grad , i believe ) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed . so it 's no surprise that spike lee , the morehouse man , would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin . i 'm not saying that you had to attend an hbcu to understand `` school daze '' , but you had to have attended one to get the real `` flavor '' of what it was like . and you have to have an open mind . any hbcu alum saying that this film was n't realistic is flat-out lying . yes , it hit on some things that the old folks call `` dirty laundry '' ( such as hazing , color issues , those who think that getting an education makes you `` white '' , and so on ) , but those things are real at hbcus - yes , even today . ( major props to spike for having that one dark-skinned sista in the gamma rays . is n't that always the way ? ) and there are no `` good '' people or bad people ; spike leaves that decision up to you . julian had his good points ( his intelligence , leadership and pride in his town , school , etc ) and dap had his bad points ( his blatant bigotry and bullying ) , and both of them had legitimate points . one thing spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis . no offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a pwc , but in my experience at a predominately white high school , i noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike ; they particpated in a more `` destroying from within '' kind of system , and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted , even with solid proof . ( `` i would never spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper ! '' ) black students , on the other hand , will take anyone head-on , whether that person is the school president , captain of the football team , the richest kid on campus , crippled ... does n't matter . your `` status '' does n't count if you go to an hbcu . i had a friend who saw sd and said `` that is so unrealistic ! since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time ? '' she graduated from the university of texas . enough said . i 'm so grateful for this film , and its realistic portrayal of black hbcu students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare , and that people only go to hbcus because they ca n't get into a `` real '' college . i would n't trade my experience at florida a university for a degree at any pwc . rattlers
0	note that in my previous review , in which i commented on the dreadful dvd transfer , i was only referring to the `` that touch of mink '' dvd . the father goose dvd is not that bad
1	truth be told , i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively . when this thing gets going , though , the descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status , and on top of all the incredible special effects , oppressive atmosphere , and grievous bloodletting ( made with a pretty limited budget , by the way ) , one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner . are you kidding me ? blood , gore , a claustrophobic atmosphere like you would n't believe - and subtlety ? how could i not give the descent five stars ? so you 've got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky , extreme activity . white water rafting , for example . everyone has fun , but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women , sarah ( shauna macdonald ) , forever . still recovering from her terrible loss , sarah joins her friend beth ( alex reid ) in america , where mutual friend juno ( natalie mendoza ) , an alpha female if there ever was one , has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored . joining in the fun are holly ( nora-jane noone ) , juno 's new gung-ho sidekick , and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet . the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians ( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk ) , then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure . once they descend into the cave system , though , things start getting more intense fairly quickly . their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal , especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses . that 's when juno , a woman with more than her fair share of secrets , admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before , supposedly to help reunite the group . well , it does just the opposite , but they just have to keep going . if there is a way out , they 're going to have to find it the hard way . things are already creepy enough at this point . the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets , making the viewer feel as if he/she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters . just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight , dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic . but the real fun was just about to begin . in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you 'll ever want to squirm through , sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them . no one believes her - at first . when the `` crawlers '' attack , though , all hell breaks loose two miles under ground . these gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind , albino humanoids who hunt by sound , can scamper and climb like monkeys , move unbelievably quickly , and really tear into whatever flesh they can find . not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves , the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light . and when the girls fight back , it 's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy , bloody , gruesome department . and even as characters are fighting for their lives , a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher . the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences did n't get to see the true final scene of the film , for some pretty questionable reasons . a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference . do n't worry , though , as the dvd has both endings available . the descent draws deeply from the well of man 's most instinctual fears , making it one of the most atmospheric , heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while . the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here . the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that . if you care the first thing about horror , you must see this atmospheric tour de force
0	the main character came across as gay to me too . this movie is in no way realistic . the other reviewer is right about everything . it 's a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns , the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick . the `` martial arts '' in the movie are weak and sloppy , there 's no way that crap would actually work in real life . i do n't even know why i bothered to watch the whole thing , i guess i just found the stupidity amusing . the cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie , unfortunately that 's the only thing they put much effort into . i rented it from block buster too , they need to burn it . this movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something , like they had to make a movie to pass drama class
0	i bought the dvd hoping to see one skit -- the funniest one my family had ever seen on snl . we had it recorded on vhs many many years ago and somehow lost it . but we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits -- `` smiling laughing joking around man '' ... `` man who reminds me of my doggie '' ... `` hair head ! '' i thought for sure that the funniest skit in all of snl history would be on there , but no ... it was just a 20 second clip . i was so disappointed ! ! and it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety ... they just were n't funny . on a positive note , there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the dvd that was so sweet , it brought me to tears . and the bonus featuring phil 's audition was quite interesting . but overall , i do n't recommend it .
1	this comedy , like click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through . the characters in this film can be hated at points , especially michael douglas ' and matt dillon 's but there is a lighter side ! owen wilson is very likeable as dupree , an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job . the cast is fine and one of the strength 's in this film ! however , i think it gets too serious at points . this is supposed to be a comedy after all . i would n't buy it but it is certainly worth renting
1	this was an excellent sophomore season for a great series
1	our one year old loves this one , and so do i . the music is wonderful . the creative incorporation of vivaldi 's four seasons and monet 's masterpieces are entertaining and educational . the children , little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child . we watch this one most of all the baby einstein 's that we have .
0	i was so disappointed in this film . the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul terrance howard put into his acting . i love terrance , he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing . he did an excellent job with the acting but i would have much rather seen him portraying marvin gaye . call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in memphis , tennessee in this day and time ? and did terrance howard give ludacris ' character a cassette tape to listen to ? not a cd , a tape . i probably would have flushed it down the toilet too . and the hook to that song , `` you know it 's hard out here for a pimp . '' ya think ? with prostitution being illegal in the state of tennessee and all . i found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because i was so embarrassed . do n't get me wrong , i love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just do n't quite bring it , do we ? `` the cookout '' `` how high ? '' `` girl 6 '' `` woo '' `` kingdom come '' now we can add `` hustle and flow '' to the list . i 'm glad terrance howard redeemed himself in `` crash . '' do yourself a favor and pass on this one .
0	as cute and talented as i think hugh jackman is , this production was a waste of time , space and money . everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves . the acting is bad , the script is horrendous and the cg people apparently think their stuff do n't stink ... which it does-badly . it 's not the worse movie i 've seen , but it 's surprisingly close . please do n't waste your time with this film
0	this very b grade horror film left alot to be desired . aside from one blasemophous scene where the demon priest sucks on a crusifix to suggest oral sex , and a young man who has ripped open his shirt to carees his pecks sucks his crusifix , there wasnt much to make this unrated . if your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity , forget it ! the nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin klein undies . however , if your someone who likes to use your imagination , this might be for you . one good thing about this flick is a pre charmed hottie drew fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies . if your a big drew fan like me , it might be worth buying , utherwise go buy a playgirl
1	`` domestic disturbance '' is a thriller about a divorced couple and their child . frank ( john travolta ) has to deal with a man marrying his ex-wife susan . the guy ( vince vaughn ) is well liked by the community , but there are hints of something being amiss with him . frank 's son claims he witnesses his mother 's new husband rick commit murder . the more frank investigates rick , the more suspicious he looks . the investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse . there is great interaction between travolta as a concerned parent and vaughn the cold heartless type . the tension between them breeds suspense . the would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those around him . there are few things he would n't do to get his way . `` domestic disturbance '' is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action . i highly recommend it for those who enjoy a thriller that will keep you guessing to the last minutes .

0	me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater . i ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull . after about a half hour my friend , who tends to be more `` progressive '' than i , actually suggested we leave . it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing . ever ! perhaps i 'm biased . however i highly recommend that no one get this movie . the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant . i tend to lean to the right , but even i was entertained by v for vendetta , despite it being blatant liberal propaganda . if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil , at least make it interesting
1	this film had a powerful effect on me . 95 % of the people i know do n't read books . i met a millionaire not long ago , who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life . lady di was reported never to have read anything -- - except perhaps fashion mags . my children hardly read , and their husbands and wives certainly do n't . my ex-wife never read anything . her father thought ulysses was a dirty book . i stopped watching television in 1980 , and i own 10,000 books -- - but not fahrenheit 451 , which i 'd read about 45 years ago . this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury 's text , but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear , and with a very solid punch to the plexus . the manner in which it is written , played and directed , added to its impact . this world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us . the style was strange , but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal . people live and work like automated morons . they ca n't think for themselves , and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied . they ca n't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind : in fact , present them with an idea , or attempt to initiate a discussion , and they 'll often become angry . some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts . ludicrous suggestions : remake it with mad mel gibson . have infantile spielberg direct it . bulk it out with computerised sfx . these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets , and many of them seem unable to understand their own language , let alone write it , or spell it . this is a memorable film , for those whose memories still function . unlike the captain of the firemen
0	this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times . it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties . eli wallach is good but confusing -- who and what is he after ? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't . what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better -- less comedy and more plot and of course -- action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare -- -- i would n't
1	this is one of the best movies starring children i have ever seen - ozu embraces their viewpoint - often litterally from their eye level . often in other ozu films like 'tokyo story ' , and 'early summer ' - we would see flashes of children from a strikingly noncondescending and , often times , humerous perspective . now in 'good morning ' we have an almost entire film devoted to childhood - and events that are important in the lives of these kids and their parents and family . like all ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style full of wonderfull compositions . it is not as masterul as 'tokyo story ' of 'floating weeds ' - but it gives us a better understanding of ozu and how he saw the world - very charming film
1	this movie is good fun . the sound track is excellent . does anyone know how i can get a cd sound track of this movie ? send info to geraldkalisik @ hotmail.co
1	war exposed some violence simmering within one gulf war veteran . christian bale is electrifying as jim , a tough-minded ex-ranger whose brutal nature did n't subside after his return home to la . they say war changes a man . this might be evident here , but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed the demons inside of jim . along with his buddy mike ( freddy rodriguez ) , the two tear through the town , bingeing on drugs and alcohol . their is no deep plot here , just a couple of ruffians going around town looking for jobs . but it is a great character study , watching jim self-destruct . bale is great in this type of role , like he was in american psycho or the machinist . i liked this movie much more than training day , which this director previously wrote the screenplay for
1	the brood is the lightning in the bottle that director david cronenberg has never been able to duplicate . while all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them , the brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films . it is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread . there is a pervading coldness about it - such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it - you want to watch it with the lights on because you 're very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights . the film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick . it warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place . this is a very bloody film ! samantha eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her . she is being treated by a creepy oliver reed ( in one of his better performances ) . art hindle is her ex husband and he 's worried about how she is treating their young daughter . after a while that is the least of his worries , as these horribly disfigured and ( what the hell are they ? ) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off samantha eggar . i wo n't say more , because part of the horror in a cronenberg film is the pseudo-science that he get you to believe in . whereas cronenberg 's videodrome was weird , but not terribly good , the brood is one of the creepiest films i 've ever seen and a guilty pleasure ( can i really call it that ? ) that i choose to subject myself to every so often . really ! what are those things ?
1	i would reccomend this film to any robert johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at . it includes some great interviews with johnny shines , robert jr lockwood and others who knew robert . its worth it just to hear lockwood play an unrecorded song of r.j. 's ! the parts where keb ' mo ' re-enacts segments from r.j. 's life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman . my only criticism would be that there are few extra dvd features , however , that does n't stop me watching this film again and again ! a very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest delta bluesmen
0	i found this movie to be almost unwatchable . if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes , then this movie is for you . the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it . altman can pull off such greats as `` mash '' and `` godsford park '' and then stink up the joint with this . what 's up with that
1	timeless classic movie . 2 of the songs are frequently re-done by various artist
1	the perpetrators of a high-level corporate scandal ( masayuki mori , takashi shimura , ko nishimura ) are pursued by the illegitamate son ( toshiro mifune ) of a low-level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes . this film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic , but the masterful director akira kurosawa is not content to let it rest there . he draws out all the moral complexities of the situation , then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title . the bad may not always go to prison for their crimes , but do they really `` sleep well ?
0	bad , bad , bad . bad acting , bad writing , bad directing . i was sort of neutral about dicaprio until i saw this steaming pile of bad acting . consequently , since seeing this , i have n't voluntarily watched another dicaprio performance . it was a huge mistake by the director ( or the screen writer ) to not set this in the era in which jim carroll grew up . or if it was meant to be , it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms
0	my boys have grown up with dave hood playing all sort of characters like busdriver dave , pilot dave and fireman dave . i was excited to get this new dvd as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks . unfortunately , there 's a new dave ( kind of like the change that took place in blues clues ) and it 's just not the same . the new dave is not bad perse , but after years of dave hood 's cheesy grin , i ca n't say that we watch this one much if at all
0	the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella - too bad those are n't basinger 's legs though . nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger . i have never understood ackroyd 's characters . and keeping in form , he is once again as unfunny as mud . basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film , but that 's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film . ok so she munches on batteries , and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime . she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts . jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script . however , his contribution seems way overstated to me . he does n't have much to do . funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people . basinger 's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do . think , jar-jar blinks . i suppose it 's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning . but that 's it . flat and mechanical
0	second straight-to-video sequel to 1995 's `` the substitute '' has part-time mercenary , part-time substitute teacher treat williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced-up jock students . williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university 's football team to a local mafia goon . pretty good in a dumb saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then ... well , swiss cheese , i guess
0	i idiotilcy got this dvd because of colin firth , and , as you can see , it sucks . btw , this is not `` prasadjonnalagadda '' but rather his daughter , he just comes to buy crap , but never reads the reviwes . anyways , i had better time watching a syndicated simpsons ' episode than watching this bomb . at first , i thought that this movie might 've had some potential because of the suberb stars : colin firth and minnie driver ( good will hunting , won an oscar for it ) i did not yet know heather grahm , but after this movie , i hate her now ! i will admit , she was alright up until she got drunk in the car . that . was . annying beyond reason . other than that , the film 's set up is absolutly horrible , starting off with colin coming to a town just because it 's called hope ? and falling in love with someone only after a couple of days ? and there is also the horrible music that does n't fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene . pepole , i originnaly gave this a 2 star for colin and minnie , but heather is responsible for everything else .
1	i encourage anyone who enjoys superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun-filled nostalgia , to purchase the entire series of the `` adventures of superman '' ( played by george reeves ) ; the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed dvd 's ( i got mine all at once in a 3-pack collection , saving a little $ $ ) . this is your chance to view the entire superman tv series , from the first episode to the last ( prematurely ending with the death of george reeves )
1	p.d . james ' mysteries rank as outstanding entertainment . this cd featuring roy marsden as adam dagliesch is excellent . it has well developed characters , a complex plot involving actions that took place years before , and scenes in both london and on england 's coast . i highly recommend this product
1	in response to the earlier reviewer , this is sergio garrone 's django il bastardo , not the other film the reviewer mentioned . django il bastardo is a small gem among spaghetti westerns , a low budget b movie in which a ghost ( django ) avenges his own death ( a topic later adapted by clint eastwood for his `` high plains drifter '' ) . hence , steffen 's `` wooden '' acting is totally appropriate for the role . a little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere , innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors ( a standout is luciano rossi as the main baddie 's insane brother )
1	beware ! this is not the tv series as described by the first reviewer ( not the reviewer 's fault ) . this is instead , the movie version of `` return to treasure island '' , and the tv version is by a different distributor
1	this film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation . blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic . this is definitely true of the younger generation in this film . another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval . some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be black in america while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals . so if you 're in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view `` five on the black hand side '' and breathe in the culture
1	i just watched `` mommie dearest '' for the first time tonight . as most critics and fans of `` mommie dearest '' acknowledge , the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse , with such an over-dramatic ( but entirely true-to-life ) performance by faye dunaway , it was both hilarious and depressing . i 'm 30 and did n't know much about joan crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being `` classic camp . '' seems to me crawford was probably bi-polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder . i think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to . she knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do , whether it was having a successful marriage , a happy family , or even giving to charity . her life was a running commercial directed by hollywood , not unlike the tabloid-driven , image-obsessed hollywood we have today . despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her sibling 's victimization on film , christina 's abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life . christina crawford was completely justified turning her mother 's image on its head with her book and movie . yes , the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering . after all , what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh . mocking the unexplained , unjustified pain you experienced in the past , renders it powerless to harm your future . this is the legacy of `` mommie dearest '' whatever joan crawford really was
1	it 's my first semester teaching a general-student jazz history course , and i wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved . i bought this video as a `` best-of-all-options '' choice , and was bowled over by it 's thoroughness and attention to detail . everything we 'd discussed about armstrong during class was there on the tape , reinforcing my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear and see the legendary louis . for pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile , but for instructional purposes i 'd consider it a necessity for any future jazz classes i 'd teach . i paid $ 16 bucks for it , but having seen it i think i'd 've paid fifty ! ( shh ! do n't tell amazon !
1	this is a most beautiful movie . i can`t imagine anyone not enjoying it . the two disc package is brilliant and i will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after i have gone
0	this is not a good movie ! bad acting , story , and picture ! i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not . pass on this one unless u have 2 have it
1	maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with chekov 's work and therefore have no preconceived notions , but i found this british made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution russia . the story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose , and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy , sentimental , or even tragic
0	i love the office . what i do n't love is amazon listing a 3-disc boxed set of seasons 1 and 2 and the 2 bbc specials for sale and then mailing me 2 separate discs of seasons 1 and 2 . so be aware that amazon is not shipping what they advertise here . i have contacted them and have had not a reply about this
0	unable to see the movie . received the original shipment , and later a replacement , and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie
1	well , at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter . each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet . beware , the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while . the dvd has a different narrator than the original ( neal morrissey ) videos , but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s
0	i placed a wrong order and so now i am not able to watch the dvd i purchased . it was for area no 1 , but we ca n't watch the no 1 area movies in turkey . therefore i do not have a review
1	a great exercise tape -- plenty of variety and feels like it is doing the trick . if only denise would come into the house and make me exercise daily , this would really work
1	very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery
0	most boring of the barbie movies , i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over . and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever . and i agree with another reviewer , princess and the pauper and rapunzel , much better ! ! !
0	i would love to review this lions gate dvd , but i ca n't catch one word in ten . it is not , as advertised , closed-captioned , and the characters ' speech is too casual and british for me to get . drat ! -- i was so chuffed to see there was a cc version
0	this is a rather peculiar film for seagal , and the first thing that should be pointed out to any seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film . seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief . in fact , they are extraordinarily brief , though thankfully free of wirefu . though out of reach is by no means a total failure ( it 's actually pretty entertaining , seagal as always is fun to watch , and some of the scenes are well done ) , the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes . this film is a drama about a nature nut ( seagal ) who roams the forest looking for injured animals . he has a pen pal in poland , a young girl , and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her , even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her . this brings up the main problem with this film , namely , a lot of it simply does n't make any sense . it turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring , and seagal goes through the motions to save her . as per usual with seagal nowadays , he obviously refused to actually finish the production , and so we have the usual dubbing problem here . it is even more salient than usual in this picture , however , for here we have not one , but several different people dubbing seagal 's voice , none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him ! here the most frequently heard fill-in for seagal sounds like a knock-off benecio del toro with a much higher-pitched voice . as you can imagine , the effect is very humorous . as stated above , the main problem with this movie is that it simply does n't make sense , which was apparently realized by the director , as he has , in many scenes , the voice fill-in for seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking ! how obnoxious ! seagal 's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal , which she later uses to communicate with seagal . what makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for seagal , the villian , ineptly played by matt schultz , sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for seagal to find ! in one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code . ( apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means `` this is a trap . '' ) the villain sees her doing this , and , instead of destroying the message ( which would make sense ) , later has it delivered to seagal ! huh ? in a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling seagal where she is , the villian sees her doing it , comments on how clever she is , but then leaves the message ! there are also quite of few mistakes in this film , several of which are laughably obvious . at the beginning and end of this film , for example , seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy , black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head . during the rest of the film , however , he has short hair . at the end , after some bs macho dialogue about how seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing schultz slowly , each character uncocks his pistol even though schultz 's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock , and even though in the very next closeup seagal 's pistol is still cocked ! after a sword fight , which ends on a classic move from older chambara films , notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor , and that then , all-of-a-sudden , there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters . in the finale , the above-mentioned sword fight , the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than seagal . this brings up another frequent complaint of many seagal fans : his overuse of stunt doubles . it 's almost so bad now that one could say that he does n't even film his own fight scenes now . have you ever noticed that in lord steven 's early films , when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves ? now what happens ? the camera gets as close as possible , shows some shots of his face grunting , shows some arms playing paddycake , then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing seagal 's face . ever wonder why ? it 's because , surprise , surprise , that 's not seagal doing the fighting . in the gun fight , which is actually a very decent action scene , watch seagal as he enters the room . his character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll , which is probably the simplest move in aikido , though it is obvious that it is not seagal doing the roll . what is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film , which shows seagal 's character `` roaming the forest looking for injured animals , '' or whatever , it is clearly not seagal that we see walking through the forest . was he afraid that he 'd trip over a branch and injure himself ? was he afraid he 'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods ? i do n't know . what is likely the case is that seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact , using another actor , in order to make the film work . i 'm really not bashing seagal , i 'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could very easily be fixed . be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when seagal goes to the post office . the postal worker calls seagal `` mr. delacraw , '' or some such bizarre name , even though his character 's name is actually billy ray lancing . seagal then proceeds to mumble some french to the man , and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent . this scene is downright strange . what is also strange is how seagal is dressed in this scene -- like some kind of new orleans anne rice fan , vampire wannabe in a strange , black fur coat . i do n't know , at least it 's good for a laugh . if seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable . the only truly schocking thing is that this has n't happened yet . he shows up late to shoots , leaves early , refuses to finish productions , and yet people keep hiring the man . he repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production . he needs to start finishing his films . in closing , out of reach only has two very brief fight scenes , but they are somewhat well done . seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight , which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human .
0	i first viewed this movie on cable , that same night , i purchased the movie from this seller . to date , i have had no responses to email , no communication what so ever , and still have not received this tape in the mail . very disappointed , and not recommended to purchase from this seller
0	git-r-done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as larry the cable guy . larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head , but end up doubling you over with laughter . his preformance will definitely torque your brain , so be prepared . there are a couple instances where larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure . one such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun . i was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that larry was just messing with me because we all know girls do n't fart , they do n't even have buttholes . he then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out ever . unless you are an idiot , you know you ca n't look like him without a strict training regiment , nice try larry . he finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti-hillary clinton piece . this was the icing on the cake for me because when i think of intelligent political commentary , i think larry the cable guy ! ! ! !
0	who would give the green light to this ? it is a total remake of the 1968 classic . the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times . since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it ... it pales in comparison to the original . this was really weird to remake this movie . `` dawn of the dead '' was cool b/c it had a new , fresh spin to the story . this has no scares , no atmosphere , no innovations and no riveting performances . skip this one
1	they do't make musicals like this anymore . well , they do n't really make musicals anymore , do they ? they used to make them , made them well and they came out like `` down argentine way . '' the plot is just enough to keep your interest but the music is bright , costumes lavish and not a few laughts . the major players- betty grable and don ameche- are as engaging as usual.carmen miranda makes her us film debut and sings , dances and mispronounces her way to stardom . the 20th century fox role players appear ( charlotte greenwood , j. carrol naish , henry stephenson ) and add to the fun .
0	this is a ridiculous overkill of two fascinating characters in the 'lonesome dove ' . the whole 2 dvds were just a bunch of idiots kept blabbering , small talking , yammering , blah , blah , blah from the first second to the last minute , just like mcmurty 's novels , all the characters were just kept talking , talking , talking in meaningless small talks , almost talked your ears off . it 's so controversial and contradictory to those two characters first appeared in 'lonesome dove ' , gus talked and talked , but call never talked like what was protrayed in this pathetic 'dead man 's walk ' and the 'comanchi moon ' , the more logic one is the real sequel , 'the street of loredo ' , at least gus was dead , and call remained not just silent but more quiet . by watching this horrible movie adaptation from the original book , scripted by the author , the whole movie was doomed to be horrible . because mcmurty simply could n't omitted those yammering spread all over his original novel , page after page , blah , blah , blah , and we have to find the storyline among those conversations , dialogs , and dug them out of those garbage-like paragraphs . watching this movie was no different . those idiotic morons never kept their mouths shut . blabbering day and night , even during the comanchi attacks . what call showed in this movie and the novel could never developed into a character like what he had become in 'lonesome dove ' . because from the very beginning , everybody just quacked and quacked like a school of chickens . drive me nuts . how come these two young characters portrayed in this blabbering novel would and could have developed into the profound older characters in the 'lonesome dove ' ? once a moron , a coward , an idiot , always would be a one , no matter how old you have become . adding experiences and sophistication in the aging process never happened to a moron , coward or an idiot . how could these two jokes would have survived in that harsh environment is simply beyond me . at least the 'lonesome dove ' movie adaptation was close to what the novel read like . and 'the street of loredo ' movie was also an adaptations from the novel
0	i still have not received this dvd . it was ordered on 12/8/06 and was supposed to ship on 12/12/06 . i am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a christmas gift . i can not rate the product as i do n't have it . i sent an e-mail through amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them . i would appreciate a response or a refund
1	although many reviewers did n't like the second part of the `` hills '' , i still would n't call it `` one of the worst sequels ever '' or `` the worst wes craven film '' . certainly this is not a masterpiece , even in the framework of horror genre , but i do n't see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick . when i was watching it , i came to a conclusion early wes craven had been imitating other directors rather often . i 'm not saying he was not original at all - eventually he shot `` a nightmare on elm street '' in 1984 . but `` the hills have eyes '' were reminiscent of `` texas chainsaw massacre '' , and in the beginning of 80s , when slasher era started , i guess craven decided to make something in the same manner . maybe the reason was craven 's long-time buddy sean cunningham created `` friday the 13th '' in 1980 , and wes was envious ? : ) anyway the second part of `` the hills have eyes '' turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time . and it obviously was n't the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned `` friday the 13th '' : the score was written by harry manfredini , known to every `` friday '' fan , and the music in `` hills 2 '' is just like in early `` fridays '' . the body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie . kevin blair who had a leading male part here , would star in `` friday the 13th part vii '' a couple of years later along with kane hodder , who did stunts for `` the hills have eyes 2 '' and in `` friday '' would play you know whom . of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies ( like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together , all the big strong guys get killed , and a handicapped girl survives - i 'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning , especially if you 've seen a couple of horror films in your life ) , but is that a problem for a true horror fan ? we 've learned not to take this trivia into account . so i think `` the hills have eyes 2 '' managed on many levels , and it would be interesting to have it in your collection , if you have the first one . for they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror .
0	this movie was cheeseball beginning to end ... i thought the concept was corny even before i watched it but decided to give it a try anyway . big mistake . a robot who can love ? lame ! and with all this high tech stuff the docs ca n't bring the couple 's real son out of a coma ( or whatever was wrong with him ) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love ' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..brialliant plan ( especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world ) ..then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin . the family decides they do n't want the robot and the mom 'loves ' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of ... it was then i knew i was smelling a stinker but nooooo someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth ... i have since nicknamed it artificial idiocy ... the worst part was the end , ugh , i do n't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what i mean . the whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism . for those of you who have not seen it , i suggest renting it before you buy it . maybe this movie is great for some people , it just was n't my thing .
1	i 'm not usually a ballet person . i have n't seen anything since `` the nutcracker '' when i was six . but this was absolutely brilliant . the concept for it is completely bold and original and adam cooper as the swan blew me away . how can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop ? tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this , but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet .
1	there 's not much to say about the reputation of these movies . there 's also little to say about these dvds , many of which are the high quality special edition collections . just do the math . this is no brainer for people who do n't own any of these dvds . even if you only want 8 of them ( less than half ! ) , that 's about $ 20.00 a movie ( at amazon 's present sales price ) and since many of these movies are special editions , that 's still a steal ! this is a solid place to start your dvd collection . not everyone will enjoy all these movies ( after all , they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals ) , but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings . one note : the version of amadeus here is the reissue and the longer , director 's cut of the movie that was not originally released . some ( including myself ) prefer the tighter original release ( which can still be gotten at amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie ! )
0	i am an alice fan , so this is far far from my favorite . the first star i gave was simply because i love kate beckinsale and the movie is n't scary . the other is because it would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that does n't know anything about wonderland . my 9 year old even got bored with this . kate beackinsale plays the mother in the beginning , and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so . she just did n't look well in this movie , and everything looked so cheap and fake . the story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out . i would not recommend this . i would recommend the 1999 american mini series of alice in wonderland , it is my absolute favorite ; with martin short as the mad hatter , and a long list of big names . that one is fun for all ages
1	this was a delightful view into the highs and lows of courtship , love , jealousy , and hate and what havoc can be wrought by schemes devised to satisfy emotional turmoil . with the lovely backdrop of italy , all is well that ends well for the characters . michael keaton as comic relief is brilliant .
0	i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for . the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality . this must have been taken from a 16mm print . it may be that this film is in public domain , so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd . there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues . note : amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title , so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of `` meet john doe '' . the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this : [ ...

0	does anyone know if there is a real pg-13 version of this film ? i 've been told it came out as a pg-13 and then was changed to an r film . pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see..
1	such a kiddie classic..so cute im 22 and had to have this because i loved it as a ki
1	we all feel alone at times ... this is something 'lost in translation ' brilliantly shows its audience.. indeed loneliness often , paradoxically , occurs in highly populated areas.. it is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out ... bill murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy , who dose n't seem to quite know why he is where he is , and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. this is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. it captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. this also sort of represents the zenith of bill murray 's career and perhaps his best performance to date .
1	at last ! a full-length jimmy buffett concert on dvd ! it 's been a while coming but this is a beauty . there are so many highlights it 's hard to know where to start - perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the dvd . the sound is superb , the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a jimmy buffett concert is captured perfectly . the song mix is terrific - everything from buffett classics like volcano , to new classic like piece of work , to iconic covers like southern cross . seeing jimmy and the coral reefers perform in daylight and night-time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a buffett concert is such an all-encompassing experience ! for me , a favourite moment is the concert finale of steve goodman 's city of new orleans . steve now resides under home plate at wrigley and i 'm sure he was singing along as well . buffett fans and new parrotheads alike will find this dvd one to watch many times over
0	well you know the drill . some people will like anything that is `` artsy '' or `` out of the ordinary '' or `` made by that great director '' . its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless . the movie is about incest . it is about sex and adolescence . and , ironically , it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews . the best part of this movie is eva green . or , more precisely , eva green 's body . i did n't care about her acting ( i thought it was mediocre ) . i just sat there and drunk her body in , wishing that i was that lucky actor ( whats his name again ? ) . the only reason to watch this movie is eva green . if she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation , then i am glad it happened . the movie is visually rich . in fact , its so rich that bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see . but i will take it . he captures and celebrates eve green 's stunning body - every square millimeter of it ( including her genitals - the movie is nc17 for a reason ) , to perfection . other than that , there is nothing else in the movie . the story is utterly insipid , the old movie clips , the `` discussion '' of morality or whatever ... nothing interesting . the music is another plus point . bottomline , watch it for eva green 's body . it deserves five stars . but the movie deserves only two
1	it is a well made movie based on a great book . i was particularly impressed by the performance of the leading actors deborah findley and ciara'n hinds . following their play , you can feel in the whole the deepness and the manifold of the characters
0	i saw this movie years ago , but did n't remember much about it , except some of the songs , and the basic story . i also saw `` nights of cabiria '' , from which the story was taken . i love musicals , and i think shirley maclaine is very talented . she is very sweet as charity hope valentine , and one ca n't help wanting a happy ending for her . so why did i think this movie was awful ? first of all , some of the dialogue was so repetitious it became irritating -- how many times can you listen to charity say `` fickle finger of fate '' over and over without wanting to hit the mute button ? also , some of the scenes went on and on and on -- especially the elevator scene . and -- the intermission was totally unnecessary . but the worst disappointment for me was the musical numbers . i did n't like any of them -- - they were so far over the top as to be silly . bob fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could -- - instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers , he had so much busyness in all of them -- too many people , costumes that did n't fit the story , silly moves -- and they all went past the point of enjoyment . i fast forwarded thru a couple of them just to get them over with . i have never done that before with any movie . this could have been so much better -- the story was good , the charactors were good -- but the whole thing should have been toned down . the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if there had been some trimming . it was entirely too long . also -- - all that stop action -- what was that all about ? i know , i know -- it was to show the progress of the story , but it was a distraction . i did n't like the movie and was glad when it was over .
0	compared to argento , i must say that mario bava is for me entirely overrated . he might be a pioneer , but as a stylist he is sadly lacking . his seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry , even if you like horror films . argento fans seeking out 'shock ' on the strength of daria nicolodi 's starring role , music by two members of goblin ( under the nom-de-plume 'a.libra ) and srgento 's supposed giallio-based debt to bava should buy 'shock ' with caution . although it is an authentic slice of eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror hollywood churns out , it is still a fairly dreary , dull , repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances . finally , the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of jess franco 's rubbish ( and that 's saying something ) - my dvd of the silly 'she killed in ecstasy ' , filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better . shame daria never made films without argento that are better than this..
0	this went up from one * in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii , but otherwise its just a mess . the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble , but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes , who also gave us such film masterpieces as `` casino royale '' and `` chitty chitty bang bang '' . richard harris is his usually unrestrained self , and thats not a compliment . now , i wont even go into the politics , which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero : as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas 's paean to charles ii in `` twenty years after '' , but nowhere near as entertaining .
0	this could possibly be the cheesiest movie i have ever seen ( and i have seen a lot of movies ! ) do not waste your money on this low-budget , low-acting-ability , low-camera-experience movie . i enjoy a good `` gay movie '' every now and then and this was not it . sorry to disappoint
1	i always love it when prevention release another workout because i get bored easy and i like to mix workouts up . i 've loved all of the other prevention workouts and knew i 'd love this too . chris freytag leads again and does another superb job . there are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts . the dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want . that 's a big plus so you do n't get bored or pushed for time . you can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc . if , for example , you pick that you need to lose weight , there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already . that is so helpful . the moves are all basic no frills moves , but they are effective . the first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder . the body parts are all the ones you want to workout ; arms , butt , abs and thighs . all you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy . this is so easy to do due to the programming , so there really is no excuse for not working out . this can be done by practically anyone . i also love how the other two girls exercising as well , are n't the kinds that yell and shout etc . they are as professional as chris
0	sorry , but this movie blew ! the premise was there , but the delivery just sucked . i can only take the suspension of belief so far . we are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf ( whom he 's been w/for at least a year ) about his last , one before that , and gf before that . at least two of them have his home phone number : they 've never called ? she 's never seen the caller id ? she 's never answered the phone ? give me a break ! then she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms . she meets up with joyce ( the most recent ) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes , and starts believing that the bf should really be with her . joyce is none the wiser , but if you ask me , joyce had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the model , calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone , keeps that stupid boomerang in a frame , etc . this chick , stacy ( brittany m ) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going . holly hunter 's character is precisely why i have more male friends than female . stacy just met this woman and she 's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie . i never expected the 'big climax , ' but i did ask myself several times `` will this barb ( hh ) chick back the **** off ? ! '' on to the climax : it was actually a surprise , but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for stacy ... after she humiliated all those people . i never got the impression that the bf ( derrick ) was cheating on her , yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different . the only reason he pissed me off was because he did n't read stacy the riot act in the end . this movie tries to wax philosophical , and you just end up hating all of the characters ... except for the dog . a very passible movie . i would n't even bother .
1	by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in 86 years . it 's true , the patriots somehow pieced together a team that , despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a 17-2 record ( which just as easily could have/should have been 18-1 ) ... but the 2004 boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 patriots season just does n't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003 . part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities ( 2001 having 9/11 , the coming-of-age of tom brady , the snow bowl , and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever . 2003 had the release of lawyer milloy , the early stumbles to buffalo and washington , the birth of the winning streak , winter weather in foxboro , and yet another thrilling super bowl finish ) ; 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison , like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the `` w '' on the patriots ' side of the field . this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling ... the injuries ( leading to the incredible `` throwback '' two-way play of veteran wide receiver/rookie cornerback troy brown ) , the continued winning streak , the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon , the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts , and the return to pittsburgh ( where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween ( just days after the red sox won the world series , karmically enough ) , where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl , this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville , fl . no nail-biting endings this time , though ... despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else ( with the possible exception of curt schilling , of course ) , the eagles all-pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day ( safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick , actually ) and the patriots , though trailing early , never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved . far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another super bowl ring should be considered hum-drum , but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that , impressive as it was , just does n't translate to the memorable re-telling that the pats ' previous title years do . this is a great dvd for pats fans , indispensible even , but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring , i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd 's over this one
0	there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as eye for an eye . it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised . they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end , whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end . it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort , but for this critic it is getting old . eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film . from the opening credits of this film , you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end . the pauses could be guessed , the lines could have been written the night before , and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best . it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic , the violins would always shrill around kiefer , and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere . this is your typical revenge film with no excitement , no frills , nothing that would make it stand out from the rest . the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films , which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end . where did eye for an eye go wrong ? i do n't think i need to count all the ways for you , but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters . i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic . what was sally field 's job ? i know that is a small detail , but it better highlights my complaint that our central family ( the mccanns ) were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen . i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death , yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed . ed harris literally walked through his character , proving that field 's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion . the only character worth watching , and was developed briefly , was kiefer . he was 100 % evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end . yet , we did n't even know that much about him either ( which upset me ) . schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well , the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably did n't even need to read the script , and the story played it safe from the beginning , but it was n't what i wanted to see . i expected film like this to come out during the 80s , not in 1996 . it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris , sally field , phillip baker hall , keith david , and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan . nothing stood out in this film , nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it , and nothing made me feel excited about these actors . this was a literal `` nothing '' film . it lent nothing to the cinematic world except ( and i stress this a bit ) another peg in a very tired genre known as the `` revenge thriller '' . after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it , overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements , which made me think of a high school drama production . it was amateur at best , but she said that is why directors use sally , because she is known for being overly dramatic . this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly . sally saw success with it once , but as she continues it only creates bad cinema . there were times during sally 's bigger speeches that i found myself laughing . i could n't help myself , but her focus on certain words and clichï¿½ reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike . the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he does n't have to play the outlaying father any further in films . he was completely wasted in this film . was there any emotion with him ? i did n't see any . then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue , but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes . also , did mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clichï¿½ ? urg , his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers . again , the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil , but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile . it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end . if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself . field over dramatized the entire film , thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer . did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil ? that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel , but alas , ole safe schlesinger did n't take us down that darker path . i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups , but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers . this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored . i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast , yet we chose to stay on the lighted path . that , coupled with the poor acting , just created a film that did n't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world . overall , in case it was n't obvious , this was n't a good movie at all . in fact , i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again . i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again , but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the `` revenge thrill '' fell into that same pattern . the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure , this film did not . sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight , while everyone else was forgettable . the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil . watch this film for kiefer , but nothing else . skip it ! grade : * out of ****
1	this film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy . it seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives , not unlike our own . but it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity . it avoids going too far into the subjective . it does n't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute/stagey displays of animal interaction . instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments . but by the sheer genious of editing and writing , one can not help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama . the movie wisely lets the animals ' behavior `` do the talking '' , and does n't try to push the viewers ' judgement one way or the other . it left me rethinking everything i had assumed about animals , emotions , and the nature of our ( and by 'our ' i mean all of god 's creatures ) existence
0	this is not the restored print of dracula 1931 that universal previously released on dvd a few years earlier.if you have that dvd keep it as the quality on this box set is awful.i can only think that whoever was in charge of compiling this did n't bother to look or did n't know that universal had a fully restored copy of this film

0	before i saw this movie i thought i would enjoy it . i enjoyed watching the miniseries when i was a kid . however , nothing could prepare me for what i was about to watch on screen . it was an absolute disaster of a film . i do enjoy superhero movies , some recent ones i like are the spiderman series and batman . but the hulk did not inspire me at all , it was like going to the dentist to get a tooth pulled . the character is a cartoon-like green figure , totally lacking in his emotional capacities , not even his rage convinced me , it looked like a video game more than a movie . this film had no serious plot worthy of mention . it was just plain painful to watch . if i could give it half a star i would !
1	amazon.com made sure i received my items in time . above receiving the movie in excellent condition , the movie is entertaining and reminds you what real acting is .
1	china : the panda adventure is an imax film that tells a story.. so..in a sense the pandas are a part of this story but not in the sense of a documentary . the story is set in 1936 and is based on a true story involving ruth harkness who has arrived in china to take care of the business affairs of her late husband . her husband , it seems was a great admirer of the giant panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them..this leads ruth to seek these pandas out to see for herself..as the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of china..the cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well.. ruth is played by the lovely maria bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the panda.. all in all..this film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family..but be warned..it 's more of a story involving the panda and not a documentary .
1	othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time . seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times . in the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done . the story of othello is that of a venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman . the general happens to be black . in an effort to sabotage the general , iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death . while shakespeare gives motivations for his characters , interpretations and emphases tend to vary . kenneth brannagh 's production of othello emphasies iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so . this production , with ian mckellan in the role of iago , puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight . both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in `` being bad '' wheras the latter seems more inclined to `` get even '' . both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure . the role of desdemona is portrayed in this version by imogen stubb and she is a delight to watch . she bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic . so too is the title role played admirably . the problem with othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence . this is a fine performance all around with a difficult play . if you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check , it is well worth the time
0	a dismal disappointment . i think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy . when i see the high ratings , i wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product . the original lonesome dove mini series was unbelievably well done . a complete multifaceted joy . i was so excited when i saw there was a sequel and the joy of lonesome dove would continue . well it did n't and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings
0	the most simple definition of [ ... ] is sexual gratuitousness . sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on , not providing anything pertinent to the plot . you ca n't help but get a porno feel while watching bully . and to think i was supposed to be viewing a film about teenage revenge on the local bully ; but it turns out to be a soft porn version of how vapid teenagers waste away their lives with a little killing thrown in . was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl 's crotch while she 's driving a car ? was it necessary to have a sex scene or nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes ? you ca n't help but see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex and street cred grittiness than telling a good story . the very first scene is of a guy having phone sex . several things about this movie other than the [ ... ] made me mad : 1 . you 're planning to kill somebody , then proceed to tell everybody , including the waitress at pizza hut what you 're planning . 2 . after you kill , you 're so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more suspicion on yourself by acting very strange and telling even more people what you did . 3 . which makes more sense ? to decide to kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend , or , to stop hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend out like a wh-ore. bobby never put a gun to the guy 's head to make him hang out with him , yet murder was the only option ? 4 . i ca n't believe mr. wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden muster the strength to slit a guy 's throat while he 's staring him blankly in the face begging for his life . 5 . all of the characters
1	i was stunned by this movie . i learned of it and purchased it in 2003 . for various reasons it remains for me the best , most emotional movie i have seen about musicians and their music . the producer chose well : he found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years : townes van zandt , rodney crowell , steve earle , guy clark , steve young , john hiatt , charlie daniels and a tribute to the late skinny dennis , immortalized in guy clark 's `` la freeway . '' i wish david allen coe had been left out , but no film is perfect . the songwriters are shown at their best and worst : a drunken , funny tvz falls into a rabbit hole and silent night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics . this movie was made when i was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in tampa at the university of south florida . the difference is that most of my friends and i got straight jobs [ we still tried to make a difference ] but these musicians changed the world , just a little . i married the singer/business major i met at usf and divorced 30 years later . i still play guitar , write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly i learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me . when tvz sang 'waiting around to die ' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor , while cindy comforts him . it was magical . tvz does a `` medley of my hit '' and sings `` pancho and lefty , '' and rodney crowell sang `` bluebird wine , '' both covered by emmylou . steve young 's `` alabama highways '' was wonderful too . it was a look into my past - and the past and future of the intelligent , emotional music i love best .
1	this is a great film with a bad guy that you root for from start to finish . action packed , and very smart . great cast too
0	this dvd was the first one released by michael buble , and i bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances . there are segments of performances , but the editing and fast , wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect . the performances get largely lost . what remains is a lot of footage of michael and his original bandmembers drinking , clubbing , gambling , womanizing , and generally acting like rowdy frat boys . if you really want to be wowed and experience what a live buble concert is like , i highly recommend `` caught in the act '' . this dvd lives up to it 's name as part of the pbs great performances series produced by david foster . `` caught in the act '' is slick , glossy , flashy , enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience . i 've seen buble perform live twice , and i can attest that `` caught in the act '' is just about as good as being there
1	great movie - there is n't anything i can say that has n't been said 100 times .
0	granted , i saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party , but i think i had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was . it 's so ... bad . it has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved , and the script was just awful . gosh , it 's hard to believe i actually sat through it . it was just so ... exactly what it was , i guess . a stupid sex comedy that 's absolutely terrified to be anything else . the thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material . i think my real downfall here was the fact that i 'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys . the scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it 's almost ridiculous . now , i 'm not one to get offended easily , but this just took it a bit too far . just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed , which is n't really something i look for in a movie . it just seems to me that if 'gay ' had been replaced with 'black ' , this would have been deemed racist and probably would n't ever have been released . not that i 'm condoning censorship , but when your tone becomes so ... mocking , i guess . oh well , i guess all i 'm trying to say is i will definitely not be repeat viewing this film , and i do n't recommend you view it at all if you 're a woman , or gay , or you care about others
0	i got ta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea , swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him . what 's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain 's character . swain 's character is a hillbilly who like 's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with , i never really got why swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie . this movie puts a bad taste in my mouth , it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie . ( do not buy )
1	noel and liam and jarvis are f* hilarious ... damon needs to off himself ... same with the weirdo journalist with the upper-class accent ... this video is good at making britpop seem like an actual period in music ... hahahahaha ... whatever ... besides , everyone knows radiohead and prodigy were quite accepted in the u.s. and were very original ... oasis is an awesome , lethal rock n roll band , anyone who loves rock n roll have to love oasis ... do n't cheat yourself..
0	my husband and i loved the original amityville and were so disappointed by this remake . with the special effects we have nowadays i thought this movie would have been great , i was wrong . it was pure hollywood garbage .
1	i do n't own a copy of the original cut , and it 's been a while since i 've seen the original cut . a short review of this version is as follows . the film print is flawless in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70 's or 80 's on purpose . the blue filter is gone , so it does n't look slick and shiny . this film is dark , rich , and grungy . very `` noir-ish '' , and warm . obviously the running gag through out the first film was that porter wants his 70k back ... not 130k or 1 million , just 70k . this was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it . the first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again . porter in this film is not charming or smooth . he 's smart , violent , and cold . a true anti-hero . the annoying voice over narration is gone . there are several new characters , and several new brutal kills . minus the credits , this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes . this is a great companion piece to the great `` to live and die in l.a. '' it got the same mood . i told you this review was going to be short .
1	very entertaining movie . i enjoyed everything about this movie -- - the acting , the humor , the singing and storyline ! also being from san diego originally , it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark , the hotel del coronado , being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed ! no the hotel was n't the seminole ritz in florida !
0	if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust . the grindhouse release is well worth the money . however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful . the picture quality is horrendous . the movie is lacking any redeemable quality . there are a few violent moments , but just a few . one of the absolute worst italian horror/exploitation films made . if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films , then ferox is the plan 9 .
1	instead of reviewing the content , my review is based more on the dvd presentation . pros : the dolby digital 5.1 soundtrack is just excellent , with great separation of instrument up front and in back and the great use of surrounds for more that just audience cheering . sound is only second to the shakira unplugged dvd . cons : who ever mastered this dvd must be living in 1997 . this concert was recorded in hd and is usually shown on mtv hd network . the big mistake being that the concert is not anamorphic ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . sure the majority will not care , but for those of you who own hd monitors , you will see the negative in losing that extra resolution and the fact that you have to manually zoom in . second negative being that if you want to start the concert from a specific song , you have to start the concert from the beginning and skip ahead . because if you try to start from the `` song selection '' menu , it will take you back to the menu every time the song you selected ends . overall a great concert , but a disappointing dvd presentation
0	this movie was just plain bad . it does n't just stink , it reeks . if i was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment . i ca n't believe that the other reviews were so complimentary . it 's the reason why i purchased the movie and i regret my decision . i should have read the reviews more closely . some of the reviewers had n't acutally seen the film while i am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film . everything about this movie is sup-par . the script was horrible . the sets amateurish . the dialogue stilted . ( and not in the funny style reminiscent of the tv series - which i loved ) . there are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink . first the only footage they used was from the batman movie . not the tv series . i have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the tv series realized that this movie was so bad they did n't want to associate themselves with it . they did n't use the original batmobile but a cheap rip off . i could continue by why make you suffer . the chemistry between adam west and burt ward is non-existent . and the chemistry between the `actors ' playing adam west and burt ward in the `flashback ' scenes is substandard at best . this movie is beyond dreadful . there are cameos from a few villains from the original tv show but they 're dreadful too . not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad . i wish i could say i laughed . i wish i could say that i at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all i can say is that i watched this movie in dead silence . do not waste your money or your time on this movi
0	pick any house on any street . pick any random two people ( man and woman ) , give them a script and let them go wild . i promise you could make this movie work better than the producers . nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring . the acting and settings in this movie are just horrible . by the end you want everyone to die just to become interested . now , i do n't usually give bad ratings and i really like `` b '' horror films , but the lack of effort here is unbelievable . just nothing to interest me
1	excellent presentation and goes into detail , much of which may be unknown to the viewer . one minor criticism : the participants let stanley lord of the californian off much too easily
0	the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful
0	dolph lundgren stars as a mercenary sent to kill a tribal leader and then him discovering the wrong of his nation , dull and just plain pointless ( and stupid ) action film suffers from inept action scenes and logic lapses . lundgren is imposing but ca n't act
1	some of the other reviews have said that the film is not editted properly and 'too slow ' . i 'm not a film-maker and can not comment on that other than to say that they are wrong . the film is amazing . i 'm not sure if there is any other movie or documentary that shows what a serialkiller-cum-dictator-cum-statesman is like . nowadays people might not know who idi amin is , or what he did , so its important to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie . he plays accordian ? you see him meeting with his 'advisors ' ( some of whom disappear so after . ) you see him play acting like a grown-up boy with toy soldiers . you see his self-appointed royal pedigree and send his support for nixon ! its fascinating and amazing . this is man that , self-proclaimed , actually ate some of his rivals ( not the whole body i hope ) . he killed many people directly and by his policies . his ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie . apparently , there is a new movies coming out about idi amin starring forrest whitaker . he 's a good actor and so i look forward to seeing it . but this is the real guy . its amazing and a feat probably never to happen again
0	as i stated before , i have a fabulous thing called `` digital cable '' . one night i was flippin through the channels and this movie was on . i could only watch so much of it before i had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off . sometimes that happens with `` digital cable '' , but it usually it will right itself in the end . as i watched for about a half an hour i could not take it anymore . i tried everything to fix it including switching channels , turning on and off the tv , and things of that nature . i even went as far as calling comcast and complaining , but even that was a wasted effort . i eventually had to turn it off because i was a hairs-width away from haymakering morris . well , even though comcast ruined my viewing experience so far , when i was at blockbuster i decided to give it another chance . i know i mentioned that the lead actor could not act but i thought i could look past this , because it might not be completely his fault . for one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices , or it might be because it 's his first movie . who knows but howard 's mind was made up . `` rumble in the bronx '' was to be rented . from what i saw so far on `` digital cable '' , i possibly found a person i could call my mentor , when i enter the world of stuntmen . when i returned home i threw the dvd in the dvd player and guess what ? the dvd was messed up as well , the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on `` digital cable '' . i raced back to blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy , telling them this dvd was broken . i returned home again and tried to watch it . `` what the heck ! ? '' i yelled , `` is the world against howard tuttleman ! ? '' you guessed it that dvd was messed up as too . i even tried it out on another dvd player and it proved to me that the run of dvds blockbuster has were all messed up . i got so frustrated that i threw the dvd out the window ( i rented it on my father 's card so there is no recourse to me ) . after i cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica , i was still determined to see this movie . i ran up to best buy in troy , and i found a copy . i asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version , hoping that it was a new pressing . i was happy with his answer and purchased it . well i returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop . i put the dvd in the dvd player and dimmed the lights . finally , tuttleman will have his moment . well to keep this clean and short , let me say that , that night ended with a baseball bat , three ( 3 ) stitches in my hand , a broken window , and a hefty grounding-sentence ( we are talking weeks here ) . in conclusion , some movies ca n't be good , no matter how cool the stuntman , this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot . later .
0	the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film : its narcissism . it 's gray 's defining characteristic . after a while , despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction ( he makes the best of a limited repertoire ) it just gets boring
0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim ... and we wonder why our community has so many problems..maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films ... '' color purple '' , `` for colored girls ... . '' etc . we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we `` work together '' ... that means blackmen and blackwomen..
1	spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health ; eat nothing but mcdonald 's fast food for 30 days . the result ; his health gets ruined . while spurlock 's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the lancet , it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health . i rarely eat mcdonalds ( though i enjoy the odd coke ) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in australia , as it is worldwide . the strength of mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer . mcdonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food , and made ray kroc ( its founder ) a fortune . i do n't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil , because they are multinational corporations ; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers , as well as shareholders . we happily buy coke , mcdonalds , cigarettes , and many other things obviously bad for our health , and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad . in our individualistic culture , we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control , and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists . however , the rocketing levels of obesity , especially amoung children , are of great concern , and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical . we need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction , otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents . spurlock 's experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously , and not ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence
0	i can only imagine how painful it must of been to `` act '' in this film . after the first half hour it was like a train crash to watch . do anything you can to get out of sitting through this
1	this is the 2000 or so version of the dvd . this is identical with the vhs version , except it adds two features . the first is an excellent `` making of '' video from 1996 -- which was re-done with a different host for 2006 , but all the `` interview '' segments are the same . the second was a `` making of '' video done for the dvd , which does n't add a whole lot . were i to do it again , i 'd buy this version , and skip the 2006 `` 50th anniversary '' release . this is the classic chuck jones television `` grinch '' , in one of the best packages for it . and the `` horton hears a who '' is also a chuck jones classic . `` a person 's a person , no matter how small . ''
1	i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years , and i still ca n't make it all the way through the `` level 2 '' workouts . this video is incredibly challenging , but i like that i can do the `` level 1 '' workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day . no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes . this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time . i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts . this is a great dvd
1	somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and i am sure if ben and matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime . however - it just may be one of those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible to re-capture , and in a sense , haunting . i am not obsessive in any way but i have watched this movie at least twenty times - with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where i sometimes go for comfort . the synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a great story most definitely puts this movie in a special category - so buy it and watch it . you 'll be glad you did . mik
0	imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing ... .then you would have battlefield earth . it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars . you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project . just awful . if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed
0	i saw this movie and was shocked at the contents , considering that it was aimed at children . it starts out with the gypsy esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance . while no stripping happened , there was n't much other difference in the style of dance . later in the movie , one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner i would never want my children to see . he sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he does n't have her , and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire . regardless of the rest of the movie , these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children . not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel , which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one .
1	a movie to enjoy watching many times . very entertaining and light .
1	season 3 of the l-word is by far the best yet . the character development and story have come so far since the 1st season , and are even better than season 2 . they have scaled back the sex a little bit , but when they do put it in , the sparks really fly . i love the l-word
0	it 's an interesting approach at what people will do for money . still , i hated it . john travolta was terrible [ as usual ] . lisa kudrow , who was the reason i watched this , was so incredibly unlike her role on `` friends '' as she was a murderous goldigging nympho-biatch who made you mad every time she was on screen . i was very disappointed with her performance . i ca n't believe this hilarious comedic actress went for such a ... part . the other supporting actors were no good either with the exception of bill pullman , who was pretty funny as the `` i could give a damn about it '' cop . the best thing about this movie though , is the cute , gullible waitress named wendy who 's only on screen about five minutes throughout the entire film . anyway , skip this one . it was just plain awful
0	this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen ! complete waste of my time
1	this is a film like none other you have ever seen , and as such you 'll either love it , or hate it . from the `` reviews '' posted on amazon , i 've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who do n't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it . this film is not literal . learn to *think* about what you are watching . to interpret archetypes , symbolism and metaphor . a clue : the lady character is named story . now why might that be ? and why would she require a vessel before taking flight into the world ? and what precisely does the wolf-like scrunt represent ? and why are there three of those monkeys ? this film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world . if you are n't an artist , you probably wo n't get it at all , and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this . but that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says , and love every beautiful , unique and visionary second of it . magical .

0	there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i do n't need to add anything in that regard . but , what on earth does a lesbian sub-story ( in both regards ) have to do with the story as a whole ? nothing . so , we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the appalachian way of life that , instead , heads for the trash bin
0	watched like reading a comic book . so many murders for so little money . corpses never turned stink in the thailand humid and hot temperature . lousy acting , directing and totally stupid screenplay with twisted to the limit ridiculousness and impossibility . a story so bad that turned into a disturbing watch . boasted with awards and high praises for the primitiveness or roughness of the poor plot and scenario ? give me a break
1	plot summary : a man-without-a-memory found floating in the mediterranean sea searches for his identity , discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin . reason for the rating : violence and some language . based on the robert ludlum-authored book by the same name , the bourne identity is part action flick , part stylized thriller . in his first role as an erstwhile action hero , matt damon shines as bourne , imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease . as the story opens , bourne is pulled out of the mediterranean sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an italian fishing boat . the `` hey , this is a story about espionage '' theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from bourne that displays what we later learn is a swiss bank account number . upon finding and opening the safe deposit box , bourne discovers multiple passports ( including one with the name jason bourne ) , a variety of foreign currency , and a gun . he then begins his search to uncover his true identity -- and until now , so does the audience . if there is one misstep in the bourne identity , it may be the fact that early scenes involving the cia and the agency 's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to bourne 's identity far earlier than bourne himself . at this point the film becomes more of a `` how will he survive ? '' thriller rather than a `` who am i ? '' mystery . a love interest of sorts ( played nicely by run lola run actress franka potente ) gives bourne a `` partner in crime '' to play off of for much of the movie , but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development . an implied ( off-screen ) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief , but does n't detract too much from the action . the most interesting ( and morally significant ) moment in the film comes when bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on . through this pivotal flashback ( and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense ) , we learn that the highly-trained killing machine is n't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target 's children in the room with him . bourne 's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film 's premise as he is shot , falling into the mediterranean sea . smartly directed , the bourne identity is fast-paced without feeling rushed . the cinematographer paints the european setting in shades of grays and yellows , giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama . as an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities , this film is a winner for older teens and adults . nappaland.com recommends : ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride -- the bourne identity is a worthy discovery . after the show ... if members of your family choose to view this movie , use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward : -- -what do you think prompted jason bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht ? what does this say about bourne 's moral compass ? -- -how would you feel if you suddenly could n't remember who you were ? what actions would you take to discover your identity ? -- -when faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done , jason bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew . when have you felt that way ? how can a relationship with jesus give us a `` second chance '' in the truest sense ? s
0	jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end . the only mystery is in the details . no real suspense . i found the plot to be a little farfetched
1	i ordered this movie for my husband . he loves it ! it 's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over . no big plot - but it 's got it 's moments . i 'm quite sure there is something for every european to be offended by ... so keep a sense of humor and enjoy
0	avoid this cheapo release of these great film ! subpar prints..certainly not from original 35mm elements..wait for the good one to come out down the road
0	after having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out , i was extremely disappointed . the movie very well could be alright on its own merits , but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful
1	if you liked `` raise the red lantern '' or `` the last emperor '' , this is a perfect movie.gong li , who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband 's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband . `` farewell my concubine '' uses chinese opera as a way of telling the story.i used to listen to a lot of chinese opera -- which is an acquired taste.this movie uses the story of a king beloved concubine 's self-sacrifice to frame the love story between two men.when one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman , the stage is set for a tragic love triangle.the final scenes are chilling , powerful.this is a spectacle not to be missed
0	for the time period when this was made , this was an excellent movie . made you stop and think , `` watch who you 're going to bed with '' !
0	this film is a perfect example of how straight action and big-name stars can not replace the necessity of well written drama . i will not give away the plot -- although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it . basically clooney 's character mr . ocean , a career burgler , is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a las vegas casino . so he recruits 11 men , each with a talent to add to the operation . this is where the trouble begins . the viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters . there is almost no introduction to many of them , and barely even a mention of their names . literally half an hour into the film `` the eleven '' are assembled and they 're already robbing the casino . how 's that for plot development ? and that 's basically it ladies and gentlemen : go to vegas , rob casino , go home , movie over . some of the `` good guys '' are even outright repellant . our would-be heros ' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy hollywood tycoon . am i supposed to like this fat weasel ? the only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least mr . ocean , is that the guy he 's robbing , the casion owner , is a really bad guy . supposedly he has people killed 'n stuff . ( this actor played a bad guy in godfather part 3 ) . but we never see any real evil deeds . in fact , he just seems like a handsome , polite , very prosperous businessman . he manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film . mr . ocean on the other hand , and his cohorts , are career criminals . but the guy they 're robbing is an even greater criminal , you see . so that makes it ok. and really , if you were being robbed , would n't you want to be robbed by george clooney and brad pitt ? they 're such nice guys . that makes getting robbed fun . just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy . how thrilling . this entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with julia roberts . there are a few minor things going on in the backgroung , like a boxing match , which are essentially irrelevent . throughout there seems to be vital information missing ( like say , a plot ) . soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to clooney and roberts . this film is also horribly cut . several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced , and then completely forgotten about . take the scene where pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino 's owner makes an appearence . the folder he has just been handed , explains pitt , contains secret security codes . you would think that would be something important right ? you would think they will need to get those codes . well , wrong . in fact you wo n't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie . they introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development . and that happens all the time in this movie . in fact mr . ocean 's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties . ( and boy , they started repelling down that shaft quick , did n't they ? you did n't even know they were robbing the place yet . wow , these guys are good . or maybe steven soderbergh is as over-rated as his film . ) they make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7-eleven . this , after mr . ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have . one would hope this film would at least end strong . but soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed . we are left wondering whether the `` eleven '' actually got away with their caper ... or worse . what a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted . the writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the dvd ! ( as did the actors in their commentary . ) probably the best moment on this dvd is hearing the screenwriter tell soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending . i am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars , since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad , but this film comes very close to 1 star . this is your standard artistically worthless hollywood product . it is big on budget , big on bling , and low on story . i suppose if you just feel like wasting some time , this is as good a way to do it as any . personally i would rather have a story with more substance
1	this is a great movie , especially if you like `` dancehall queen '' . paul campbell does a great job as capone and carl bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss . while the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching
0	i bought this dvd becuase i really wanted to learn the dance moves in `` you got served '' and was extremely disappointed . the only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those , i do n't know . the freestlye section at the end is fun to watch , but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video
0	i discarded the dvd after watching it . if you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home do n't buy this version of the secret garden .
0	my 14 month old son loves the baby einstein series . they 've been the only movies to hold his attention . the sounds and music get his attention , the shapes and colors hold it . that said , this movie never got or held his attention . there are no interesting sounds or music . the voices are very monotone . while i understand the intention of this video , if you do n't catch the attention of the child , what 's the worth in it ? the pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said . i also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages , but foreign cultures . if i knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited , i could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool . all around , this move was disappointing
0	i did not like this dvd at all . it requires too many props such as bricks , belts , towels , blankets , chairs , etc ... each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations . as a beginner i find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention . i feel it was a waste of money and do n't recommend it
0	this dvd is not shaolin idiot but an older film of stephen chow . it 's really a film called `` look out , officer '' that stephen chow made in 1990 . shaolin idiot is not out yet to my knowledge . if you want stephen chow 's `` look out , officer '' you should buy this dvd if not , do n't .
1	when i hear the alarm go off and the opening strains of henry mancini 's piano creep in , i know i 'm preparing for that journey into the best alcohol induced haze of the 80s on the `` crawford memorial interstate-81 '' . stops along the way include ... adoption wars birthday exploitation unfair life being let go rose rage raw ( rare ) steak one award taking that special exit for `` wire hanger etiquette '' christmas propaganda chadwick , love , and a snitch near death experience banishment making up soft drink wars loss new beginnings new losses last moments and last words before taking that final exit back to reality . in a world filled with `` f*** me '' heels , booze , domestic disputes and the biggest taboo of them all , `` wire hangers '' ... we all know she 's a movie star , she a bitch , she dresses well and she 's rich . ( quoting john waters ) i 've watched this so many times that i need therapy
0	highly acclaimed . that , i knew . i watched the first 30 minutes , which is 1/4 of the movie , before i decided to hang it up . new lady moves into a conservative french town and opens a chocolate shop . this upsets the local church , even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate . okay . can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot ? nope . this one 's boring .
1	i do n't usually like these type of movies , but this is a ca n't miss ... you 'll laugh
0	ahh , `` iron eagle '' . a classic of the 1980 's golan-globus production mill . with the current spate of historic/ '' current '' military movies , it 's sometimes good to see how hollywood 's come in trying to get the details right . one ca n't do much better than using this flick as a baseline . in case you are n't already familiar with this gem , louis gosset jr. playing a reserve air force colonel , and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed arab country -ok i 'll name it : libya- to rescue the kid 's dad . pop gets shot-down when he 's intercepted in international waters , but the us refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure . the kid and lou gosset meet up when the kid 's challenged to race the local bully with his plane while the bully 's using his dirt bike . suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe ; he does n't get his slot at the usaf academy , though . you got ta take the bad with good i guess . when the words on dad get back to the family , this kid uses his base `` network '' to get access to imagery , enemy air defense data , and two f16s carrying a b52 's worth of ordinance . all of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents , no less . ( if only strike planning was this easy . ) of course , the kid has flown training missions with his dad , and has a boatload of simulator time , so he 's a natural to fly the mission . he convinces gosset to go along with him , and his two-ship is on the way . the flying scenes are nothing spectacular , with obviously israeli f16s playing the good guys , and kfirs ( modified mirages ) acting as migs . cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer ; i 'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft . these are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit , flight , and combat models . anyway , lots of explosions on the way in , lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure . he manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land ( ! ) and pick him up . more silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground , taxi 's out and takesoff . he kills the bad guy and heads home to find lou punched out and was rescued . rather than the prison sentence for espionage , and theft of government property that lou , the kid , his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should 've got , he gets his slot at the air force academy . the end . overall , i guess lou 's performance was fairly good , but everyone else performed at the grade-b level this flick is . note especially a very young shawnee smith as one of the kid 's buds . worth seeing for laughs , and as a film version of a kid 's pilot fantasy .
0	the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence . this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good . it is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters . some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor , but there 's no mystery
1	joe versus the volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that 's romantic enough for girls , funny enough for guys , with effective visual symbolism , and appropriate for the whole family . maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life , or something like that , but at any rate it 's pleasant to watch , at times profound , at other times funny . the beginning 3rd is about joe ( tom hanks ) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy , really crummy job , primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical ( oppressive ) supervisor ( dan hedaya ) . ( i 've been there myself , when i worked at pines mfg h tooling and again at toro , where everyone was on dope . ) joe learns from his doctor ( robert stack , of the untouchables ) that he has a `` brain cloud '' and only a few months to live . the tone of the movie rises as joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that 's ever happened to him . he takes a former co-worker ( meg ryan ) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time . the next day billionaire lloyd bridges ( airplane ) enters joe 's life with a bizarre proposition : since he 's dying anyway , why not literally jump into a volcano - for the billionaire 's own financial motive - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime . joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur ossie davis ( the client ) and the billionaire 's two daughters - both played by meg ryan ( sleepless in seattle ) , which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie , making it even more pleasant to watch
0	i was expecting to see a decent film by bava , but after having seen about 5 of his films , i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us . most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story , this film is just like all the rest . there is no point to any of it , there is no plot and hardly any suspense , suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult , its quite tedious . chris lee is rather banal also , he does n't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio , most of the cast is rather dull also , supposedly playing some ancient noble family , they look more like 1960 's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid . the dialogue , what there is , is crude , probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes , one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says , `` i ca n't have more ice cream ! '' so , i would suggest renting `` planet of the vampires '' because that is more enjoyable than this waste . interesting character to note was `` lesmo '' , dubbed as the `` european peter lorre '' who does n't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget .
0	i just finished watching das boot . to even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous . where das boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war , u-571 is just more hollywood tripe . if you just want 'splosions and escapism , i guess u-571 does the trick . if you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come , go with das boot
0	if lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them . this movie was not scary . it would have been suspenseful if i cared for any of the characters . you know what the best part was ? when it was over . few movies compel me to write reviews , good or bad . this one obviously did
1	heavens harps and wings are nice , but what a showman extraordinaire florenz zigfeld jr. ( 1869-1932 ) wants most now when hes no longer on earth is to put on another extravaganza . it would have the brightest stars and creative talents . the most in glamour , gams and optimism , in short it would be like ziegfeld follies . with a whos who of credited and uncredited hollywood talents , this all-star revue is heaven to fans of musicals . fred astaire ( 1899-1987 ) dazzle once , twice..four numbers in all . red skelton ( 1913-1997 ) reprises his funny guzzlers gin skit . esther williams ( 1922 - ) swims , lena horne ( 1917 - ) sings and judy garland ( 1922 -1969 ) spoofs snobbery , theres verdi ( giuseppe f. verdi 1813-1901 ) opera and fanny brice ( 1891-1951 ) vauderville . patter and pantomine , and `` the babbit and the bromhilde '' with gene kelly ( 1913-1997 ) joining fred astaire in their first-ever screen pairing what a show ! the man called flo must be proud . high quality transfer . features not remastred . recommende
0	okay , the rating above is not going to be liked but i have to be truthful . the only good thing going for this movie was the return of `` snake plissken '' . this film 's plot was essentially a rehash of the original `` escape from new york '' ... a bit more special effects ( which in fact , did not make this a better movie ) ... when i go to a sequel i expect to get what i paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters . kurt russell 's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them . obviously the movie does n't really know where it 's going as it takes two scenes ( 15 minutes of the film ) ( 1st scene - president , commandant , and lackey give snake the mission ) ( 2nd scene - commandant and lackey brief snake before he leaves for the mission ) to explan to the audience what 's the basic conflict . i guess either carpenter or russell are just getting too old to take a great leap and recount either an earlier snake plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling.. i also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer ... `` carpenter ... .russell ! `` please do n't tell me `` money '' caused you to revisit a `` cult figure '' ! some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of cliff robertson , stacy keach , steve buscemi , and pam grier . robertson , keach , and grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters ! sorry , snake ... . '' i do n't love l.a. '' the-big-green-pointy-eared-one !
0	i loved `` the rm '' and expected the same level out of this movie , but my husband 's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest . the teenagers did n't even want to check it out after that scene . they also loved `` the rm '' . if you can get it from the library go ahead , but do n't spend money on it
0	i was expecting more because of the history on these tapes/dvd 's . this one was disappointing as you do n't feel like you did a workout . i like the older ones better with tammy
1	`` panic room '' is a great thriller- jodie foster 's return to the big screen . i 'd assume most people would enjoy the film itself . however , the real treat in the 3-disc special edition is the behind-the-scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film . any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture
1	i absolutely loved this dvd . i saw in on tv , but wanted a permanent edition for my 'supes ' collection . i highly recommend it for anyone interested in the history of superman , its origins and where he fits into our culture today . it 's great
1	first , i thought i bought it for my great old days . but it 's not . i really love it , and i ca n't stand watch it and watch it again ... ! ! hi studio , would you please release the 2nd season ! ! almost 2 years waiting ? o..come o
1	this is a great show and very entertaining . the story is n't the greek classic , but it 's a fine riff on it . the songs are good , and they grow on you as you watch . i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character - it 's just a cartoon , for pete 's sake . like some other reviewers , i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing `` go the distance '' over the end credits , but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version , `` no importa la distancia , '' sung by ricky martin , and it is killer ! this one is well worth the money
0	reference picture quality on hd-dvd . basically unwatchable though . i would not recommend the blind buy on this one .
1	this movie is very simple , and unique . it 's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you 're watching because it does n't feel phony . this can be credited to the acting , the situation , and the plot as well . this is n't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her . that 's all been done , and that 's what makes this film a breath of fresh air . river phoenix shows why he is missed by so many , and really allows you to connect with his character . i recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art , and be touched at the same time
1	the firms `` super body sculpt '' is a 40 mins , 3 parts workout which is broken up into upper body , lower body , and abs . each segment has its own warmup and cool down . it can be performed one segment at a time , or all together for a complete total body workout . the upper body flies by quickly with pushups , lat rows and french presses and biceps . the lower body section focuses a little too much on squats , and by the end of your last leg press exercise , there are more squats that will make you want to scream `` enough '' . i found the abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches , and too much on obliques . the stablization exercises are a great bonus to this dvd , and are my favourite . overall it is very well instructed . you can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough , especcially during leg presses and squats . i usually do all three segments to get the full benefits i need , and this dvd is great as a beginners tool to a firm body
0	this was not the entire version of the hbo special . i was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this dvd . if i had known it was n't the entire show i would n't have bought it
0	holly played by kristen miller ( she spies , man of the year ) has a nice career as a journalist with her friend played by brooke burns ( baywatch , death of the supermodels ) . the 2 of them fight over the owner of a restaurant named zucas ( i think thats close enough ) runned by actor tod babcock ( guard dogs , poor white trash ) . when holly gets pissed off at her friend because she slept with mr. babcock she tries to find a new place to live and low and behold she finds a new shy roommate tess , played by allison lange ( the hillside strangler , roswell ) . holly becomes close to tess and they seem to hit it off real well , until holly finds out some things about tess that makes her think that maybe this wasnt such a good idea . well , in 1992 , jennifer jason leigh did this to bridget fonda and now they make a sequel about it , wow , they must of went threw tons of scripts just to get to this one . pretty much the young girls on screen are eye candy and the acting is pretty bad plus the twists and thrills arent that great . this can go down with basic instinct 2 ... .in the trash can or the skeet shoot , one of the two . also starring francois giroday ( carpool guy , framed ) , tracey mccall ( not another teen movie , second degree ) , rif hutton ( osmosis jones , halfway decent ) and kyme ( school daze , geppetto ) .
0	the fridays gang steals some diamonds . mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be . his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve . plus , everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin . whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on tbs or something
0	a good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70 's and mid 80 's allen got his name on the directorial map w/ this piece of fluff . you got ta start somewhere . tiger lily is more of a dry run for his later , real comedies than an original film in its own right . allen 's early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film . many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick . a must for allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so-bad-they're-fun movies
1	one of the most compelling events of the release of kenneth lonergan 's you can count on me is that it gave visibility to mark ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who , unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash , lives of life of unattached agony and isolation . he 's a loner and a drifter , medicating his self-pity with pot and short-lived relationships . his sister sammy , played wonderfully by laura linney , reacts to the same tragedy by being , in many ways , an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom . two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash . this film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight , the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another . the ride is never easy in this film . no easy answers are given . just as important , this film , which deals with the pain of loss , never descends into the maudlin hallmark movie sap that other films would . balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight , lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss . amazingly , he does it in a fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic . matthew broderick , for example , plays a hilarious role of sammy 's neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank . the conflict between him and sammy leads to a plot point that i 'll let you discover in the film . but most of all , this film shines because mark ruffalo plays such an endearing , sympathetic , sometimes infuriating character . you wo n't forget him
1	this was my first yoga cd and i found it amazing ... i 'm addicted to it . i still cant tell whether its challenging for advanced yogis but as a beginner i really enjoyed it ... . it does not have all that gibberish spiritual blab on one extreme nor power yoga that seems to really be pseudoyoga on the other extreme .. however this cd is just clear and to the point with good instruction excellent demonstration and fantastic sound tracks ... . eric 's voice is soothing the instructions are clear and the crew is great . the length is convenient 45 minutes and music is hypnotic . the more i use it the more i feel stronger increase flexibility , breathe more calmly and improve my posture.. in other words dont hesitate just get it ! ! ! ! !
0	i had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer . the combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining . many people love this video but i just had a bad experience with it
0	way too expensive for a low quality product . the clarity of the picture is poor . there is not enough content to justify the price . i do n't recommend it at all . i feel i 've been cheated
0	well , this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get , unfortunately : the female teenage protagonist ( played by witherspoon , whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here ) acts masculine and heroic , the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant . at one ridiculous point , the girl runs around acting like a commando , a veritable one-gal army , blowing up the bad guys , while the boy hides in a cave sniveling . later , when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert , the gal snaps at him , bella abzug-style , and walks quickly ahead , leaving him in the dust . clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here , and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men . of course , in the real world , the result for such manly girls , once they become women , is that men do not choose them and they remain alone , and therefore become bitter -- ironically and inevitably blaming men , of course . in this movie , the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy , masculine gal -- but that 's why they call them movies . when are these post-modern writers , artists , and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism , they are touting something unnatural -- men simply do not prefer masculine females . men want someone to complement them , not compete with them . men crave femininity in females , not feminism . wow , is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie , at least his character does progress a little bit : by the end of the movie , instead of craven and flippant , he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut , if that is even a step upward . but the plucky gal -- she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations . uh , another problem with this movie -- and there are many -- is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert , something which should be , and for a time is here depicted as , a foreboding and life-threatening task . yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog ; and we see the boy 's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner , considering the dire situation they are in . the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted , inane scenes . look , i dig disney kid movies -- more realistic ones . you know , old style disney movies . you take `` old yeller '' for example . now there was a quality kid movie , and quite true to life . this movie was not . it had a plastic , spoiled-american-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout . disney has gone down the tubes . in any number of ways , they 've been subverted by radical marxist agendas ( note : one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion -- something called `` tapping , '' while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-pc judeo-christian religion -- this is bias , folks , leftwing , pc bias , same as the aforementioned feminist bilge ) . i am learning to run , not walk , away from disney stuff , and this movie was further cause for me to do so .
0	clearly this movie was never intended as high art , or even a zombie gore fest , although hyped as such , so it`s probably a bit unfair and easy to take shots at it , however i think it fails on it own terms . *** many spoilers to follow *** stop here if you plan to view the entire film . the premise : a group of stupid eco terrorists raid a research facility in london , even though warned by a researcher , release some highly agitated but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and infect them with a fast acting ( within seconds ) virus that transforms them into insane , red-eyed murderous really fast creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites and even scratches . one drop of their saliva or blood can infect you . the plague is let lose ... the hero : cut to a skinny kid of about 110 pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital bed , it`s 28 days later and he wakes up , but no one 's there . he then wanders around an empty london , in hospital scrubs , looking confused , yelling `` hello ! ! `` , `` hello ! ! `` there are no bodies outside , and nothing that looks like the remains of one . there are almost 15 million people in metropolitan london . where did they go i asked myself ? the supporting cast : he then wanders into a church , and finds it full of what looks like sleeping people , he yells `` hello ! ! `` at which time some start screaming and rush at him , in the close-up it`s clear they have turned and he slugs the creature-priest thing with his bag of coke cans . he gets out , more stuff happens , eventually he meets smart and tough selena ( naomie harris ) armed with a matchete and mark ( noah huntley ) , armed with a steel bar , who have avoided infection and explain the situation to the dim whitted hero , who turns out to be a bicycle messager boy who lives with mum and dad . seems the creatures come out mostly at night . mostly . hero insists on going home , mark selena tag along . we find his very middle class mum dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose of booze and pills . guess they could not live in a world without telly ... more talk and moaning and tears from hero who very unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack by some nasties , more fighting , bad guys are killed by selena and mark while hero cowers on floor . mark gets infected , denies it , but is chopped by selena who `` can see it in his eyes `` . damm girl ! if i`m ever in a zombie movie i want you along ! day 2 comes , the pair then wander aimlessly though london chatting away about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival and at this point i start thinking ; wouldn`t it be a good idea to get some guns ? preferably full auto , with a lot of ammo . i mean , although the creatures are fast , they are stupid , don`t run in packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead . police stations and military bases are all over london , probably deserted , and filled with guns ... .but this doesn`t seem to occur to our wandering charactors who trust to a baseball bat machette which you must get close to use ... .emmmm . i start squirming a bit in the seat , and for the first time look at my watch , but it`s still kind of ok . so far , it`s still a tight , well made interesting film , with the bloody action well filmed and important to the story line , and mostly believeable in it`s own low buget post apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that holds my interest . maybe there a reason the hero is cast as stupid , or will he grow and learn through experience ? , maybe , but it better be soon because we are almost 30 minitues into the film , and it`s getting real hard to identify with him . or care . the suporting cast 2 : night falls . our pair see flashing lights on the top of a high rise , much action ensues , they find more survivors , just a average working type dad taxi driver and his young daughter . more talk , seems they are out of water and there is a radio broadcast giving direction to go north where the army ( who usually have guns ) has set up a secure area . works for me . after some debate on whether it better to stay where they are , isolated , in fact trapped on top of a building , with no water or power or food or real weapons until overrun by zombies , or travel north to safety , in daylight and safety ( remember , the monsters don`t operate in daylight ) this group of dopes reluctantaly decide to go north , in a taxi , with no guns.. ( remember rule # 3 of zombie films : gun are good ) ..and at this point in time this heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in believablity . the journey of the dumb : piling into dad`s hack , loaded with junk as if going on a brighton holiday , with all , even tough selena giggling and laughing , off they go . when faced with the choice of driving through a dark tunnel , where it is obvious that they could be trapped and killed , or another safer route , they naturally chose the tunnel . stuff happens . stopping to get gas , the hero wanders alone into a dark , confined space for no real reason , armed only with a baseball bat . more stuff happens . stopping for the night , they decide that a picturesque , open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to ... ... you guessed it ! start a really big fire and go to sleep with no one on guard . i`m not making this up folks.. ! ! nothing happens . however they do get to see a family of white and black horses running free , and it`s clear that we are no longer watching a horror / action film , with some internal logic but a trite `` message film `` . they reach the army blockade , but no one is there , in spite of dead everywhere , they proceed to split up and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see . more stuff happens . after this , the stupid illogical stuff comes fast so this is a good stopping point . at the end we learn from the crazy and sadistic army major ( aren`t they all though ) that the goon`s can`t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it . think about that one . we also learn that the virus is contact borne , not airborne , think hard about that one dudes ! since it started in one local it`s very unlikly to have spread thoughout england in 28 days ... .big plot holes , dumb ending , 110 pound stupid hero becomes arnold the terminator in 10 mintues . girls decide it`s far better to die a gruesom death then put out and lose their honor to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in cammos , who are their only protection ... really dumb stuff after an excellent start . sad ... .this was a really superior film for the first 20 mintues .
1	i enjoyed francis veber 's 'the closet ' - released in france in 2001 - for two reasons . first , it features an all-star ensemble of french acting , certainly a tribute to veber 's skill as a director . just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the imdb credits : daniel auteuil ... . françois pignon gérard depardieu ... . félix santini thierry lhermitte ... . guillaume michèle laroque ... . mlle bertrand michel aumont ... . belone , the neighbour jean rochefort ... . kopel , the director imagine a movie where the great jean rochefort gets slotted sixth . each of these six stars can carry a movie in france on their own back . the fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to veber 's reputation . his previous release , 1998 's 'the dinner game , ' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece . actors get attracted to that type of skill . the second reason i got a kick out of watching 'the closet ' : i just learned that 'bend it like beckham ' writing partners gurinder chadha and paul mayeda berges are prepping a uk re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release , with chadha at the helm . her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by beckham 's runaway success , so i feel like i 'm in on a really great secret knowing she 's working on a re-make .
0	this video was not animated like the classic chuck jones features such as `` the cat in the hat '' and `` the grinch '' . my daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation . we give this video a thumbs down
0	this film is visually stunning and impressive , and has talented and credible actors . unfortunately , there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are `` trained '' /brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity . the settings and group `` sermons '' from nazi officials are striking and convincing , but there is nothing that ties it all together . our hero fails to strike the `` killer blow '' and is stripped , literally and figuratively , of all status and walks away . the end . i 'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film , and i was surprised by how un-gay it was . in fact , the two boy `` friends '' work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress . it 's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else . i have issues with some of the pacing as well . i found myself pressing the fast forward button several times , and did n't really seem to miss much . not a good sign . so , for what it is , it 's okay . certainly not a masterpiece , and certainly not something to run out and buy .
1	.. with an all-star cast . the plot is not new ( stage door , how to marry a millionaire and valley of the dolls to mention but a few ) , but judy , hedy and lana do an admirable job . never mind highbrow critcs ; hedy lamarr wasn`t that bad and lana does one of her best acting jobs ever . judy is a tomboy and it`s sad that life eventually took her into the direction of lana`s character sheila . the musical numbers are good , but sadly ; footage from the great ziegfeld are edited in ( note the finale ) . james stewart are good as well - as are edvard everett horton , charles winninger and eve arden . the film is filled with good 1-liners and there are even echoes of garbo`s first sound-entrance in anna christie
0	with the straight story , lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love . this film felt like a `` blind date '' gone bad . the straight story showed up , david lynch arrived , but the rest of the date felt muddled , confusing , and utterly disastrous . everything in this film seemed wrong . lynch 's choice for lead actor , the bland sissy spacek , the filler of repeat cornfield montages , all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read , i just felt that nobody had control over this picture , yet the randomness ( and the possible tear ending ) gave critics something to smile about . this is not a david lynch film , and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive , twin peaks , or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated . the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa , but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois , it just seemed repetitive and boring . what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose . alvin lying on the ground because he ca n't get up , the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating , while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame . spacek 's depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale . she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes . i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema , but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors . then , to add more fuel to the fire , there was richard farnsworth . again , he is n't a horrible actor , but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically , but alas , could n't master it mentally . farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen . i could n't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character . his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes , and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending . his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic , while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime , i saw it as babble ( and no , i am not that insensitive - i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger , more professional actor ) . the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant . i wanted lynch to either go 100 % for this film or none at all , but alas , it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap . speaking of david lynch , where did he go in this film ? there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love , but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns ' `` looking at america '' class . i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film . instead of keeping us by alvin 's side throughout his journey , lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn . there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while , but when the same images were used over and over again , i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about . i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film . he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin , but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for . i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way . alvin was a walking storybook , filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well . lynch made alvin very closed minded , which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature . alvin was a strong character , but i needed more with this story . i wanted him to make choices , learn new things , and bring that to his brother 's table when they eventually met . i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin , and not vice-versa . overall , i was n't stunned by this picture . i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just `` played it safe '' . the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin . speaking of alvin , why could n't he have been a stronger , better-rounded character ? i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america , but instead gave us nothing more than soft music , recycled images , and stock characters . the stories were interesting to listen to , but brought nothing fresh to the table . i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye ( since i have a brother as well ) , but why could n't we focus on this further . lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan , when it was the central focus of this film . the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch , but instead it felt jagged and old . i could suggest one viewing for this film , any further , and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be ! grade : ** out of ****
1	one of the warmest , most pleasantly lip-smacking film 's ever ! made by a guy with a super-sized heart , america is a joyous celebration of the burger , and the down-home folks who create some of the most wonderfully odd versions of it . take it from someone who has the hamburger america poster hanging up - this little treasure is a home library essential
0	yes . wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes . are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot ? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story . recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film . candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast ( from oscar nominee matt dillon , kevin bacon etc ) can turn candy into cuisine
1	in the days of the arcades there was a good movie that came out ( and funny enough had a great arcade game ) called krull . now mind you , i really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it ( when i was a whole bunch younger ) just saw the 5 bladed `` glaive '' and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie ( including those terrible scifi d movies ugh ) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the slayers and from then on its a totally different experience . with such ultimate favorites as the emerald seer , the widow of the web and the cyclops and of course the shapeshifting ( a bit daft too ) wizard with some very strange habits ( i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it ) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come . pros : cool effects ( for the time ) good story well done plot and themes cons : may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough . but remember it is a tad old . its a 5 star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made this movie great
0	between the amended `` politically correct '' ending to this famous tale and the so-very-hokey interaction between kirstey alley and lloyd bridges , i could n't wait for this to be over ! the animation was very poor quality ... the music was not the focus , my grandchildren lost interest . shat else could possibly have been wrong
0	ok , check it out , there 's two jack blacks . one is the guy from tenacious d , you see him all the time . he 's funny and childish and insane . then there 's the other jack black . he 's the evil creature who pervades films like shallow hal and king kong , whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident . well , as long as you are n't fat and do n't feel patronized by gweneth presuming to know what it 's like not to be desired all her life ( ha ) , then by all means suspend all disbelief , logic , and brain power and watch this dumb movie . gweneth 's fat suit is actually pretty convincing , although most of the movie she 's played by an actual fat chick ... who by the way should have just been left in , without the whole `` ha ha the dude thinks she 's skinny '' nonsense . obviously , a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if : a ) he were n't brainwashed b ) his fat girlfriend was n't replaced by a twiggy blond chick c ) the movie did n't throw ridiculous concepts your way ( like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it ) d ) tony robbins was in no way involved whatsoever i knew i was slumming it when i saw this movie . but i 'm not sure what the message of this film is . jack black 's character is decent , considerate , great with kids and perfect in every way . oh , except he 's really shallow for no dicernable reason , other than his dad 's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail . the weird part is that hal 's not a bad person . the movie beats you over the head showing you he 's the nicest guy on on the face of the earth , so you ca n't really laugh at him looking like an idiot . rosemary is so fat she has superpowers . her butt actually creates typhoons ( i wonder if that has military applications ? ) . suddenly , hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews . tony robbins brainwashed him , the fiend ! when hal finally realizes this he decides to ( ooh big spoiler ) love rosemary anyway , and learns a valuble lesson . along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he 's dating rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss , and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental he is dating a fat girl ( 'cause that would make any woman melt ) . of course there 's requisite best friend , played by jason alexander , who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get hal to dump her . then again , the friend is a complete troll , so i do n't know why hal would want him around . and to insult us further , they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a serious note about how true beauty is on the inside . too ... many ... public ... service ... messages ! pick ... one.. ! ! but brain-dead writing aside , paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit ( despite gweneth 's postering when this film was first released ) . regardless of its clumsy benevolence , i have to rate this as a romantic comedy . and for that , i give it a rating of totally unremarkable . nice gesture , farelly brothers . not to be bothered with
1	this movie captures faithfully what is in my imagination when i read the book . even though it was made several years ago , it 's still a fantastic movie . timeless
0	absolute junk , one of the worst films i have seen . you will be doing well just to stay awake for the duration
1	`` venom `` is one of those movies i thought i would hate because i heard so much negativity about it but i really enjoyed it , being a fan of the 70 's and 80 's slashers i crave newer versions because i have seen all the other ones over and over again . venom did not disappoint me . it starts off with action and never lets up.i found it to be one of my favorite new horror/slasher flicks , the voodoo angle was good but not overplayed , i 'm simple in that i want to see a killer with an axe , machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo jumbo..i do n't want to have to wonder '' was that a dream or was it real~ ! ! '' as so many movies these days play off of . give me an old fashioned slice and dice and i 'm in heaven.and venom gave me that , so i hope to see venom 2 , if so , i 'm there ( for the record , mr jangles used the hook chain before kane in see no evil ... ) ..
1	this is the 6th and last entry in the series lone wolf cub . this one not only has a different director than kenji , who directed 4 of the others , this is the entry most like a comic-book ( the series is based on a famous comic book series ) . not that that is bad . the whole series fluctuated between great period detail , serious themes , and not taking itself too seriously . it was at once graphic and fantastic , realistic and wildly improbable , factual and imaginary . serious silly . that 's what made it so damn interesting . throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of japan . tracing actual historical roads and cities . now we end the series in the mountains and the snow , the white heaven in hell of the title . this entry has a lot of stuff going on : lord retsudo of the hated yagyu clan , ogami 's arch enemy , sends his last child , a daughter to do in ogami with her `` falling dagger '' technique . when , predictably , she fails , he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe . the downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in her majesties secret service , but it ai n't bad . that ogami 's baby cart guns never seem to need reloading etc . are minor quibbles . if ogami does n't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them , behead them , or run em through . red sprays all over the white snow . anyway , they wind the series up with a bang . one of the strangest , most unique , and unusual series ever produced anywhere . worth it if you do n't mind the violence
1	i heard so much about masaki kobayashi 's `` harakiri '' , so i bought it at amazon and watched it . wow , this movie is awesome ! ! now i do n't know who is my # 1 favorite director , akira kurosawa or masaki kobayashi . this black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by tohru takemitsu . in addition to these assets , the camera is wonderful . i pick this movie as one of `` my movies of my life '' . tatuyua nakadai was shining in this movie . i like him more after seeing `` harakiri '' .
0	this has always been a favorite film of mine . the story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine . despite having the vhs , i wanted more and ordered the dvd . beware ! this dvd claims on its packaging to have closed captioning , but it does not ! ! no subtitles in any language , no line 21 captioning . nor does it have anything else . `` interactive menus '' means scene selections . this plain vanilla release does n't even have a trailer . this film and cast deserves better and i see no reason lion 's gate reissued this dvd with nothing added . since i bought it online , i ca n't return it and neither lion 's gate nor artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people i bought it from
1	this is the final season of hogan 's heroes . sgt . kinchloe ( ivan dixon ) left the series in season 5 and was replaced by sgt . richard baker ( kenneth washington ) . the other original cast members are still up to their wacky antics of outsmarting the nazis . and , it 's still hilarious . here 's a run down of the episodes from september 1970 to april 1971 : episode 1 : cuisine a la stalag 13 episode 2 : the experts episode 3 : klink 's masterpiece episode 4 : lady chitterly 's lover : part 1 episode 5 : lady chitterly 's lover : part 2 episode 6 : the gestapo takeover episode 7 : kommandant schultz episode 8 : eight o'clock and all is well episode 9 : the big record episode 10 : it 's dynamite episode 11 : operation tiger episode 12 : the big broadcast episode 13 : the gypsy episode 14 : the dropouts episode 15 : easy come , easy go episode 16 : the meister spy episode 17 : that 's no lady , that 's my spy episode 18 : to russia without love episode 19 : klink for the defense episode 20 : the kamikazes are coming episode 21 : kommandant gertrude episode 22 : hogan 's double life episode 23 : look at the pretty snowflakes episode 24 : rockets or romance if you have the previous 5 seasons , hey , you might as well get this one ! it was the end of a great tv series that brought a lot of enjoyment to millions . it still does .
0	as the other reviewers make clear , this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who `` ruined '' her . so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation . problem is , having just watched the movie , i am not convinced there is anything below the surface . prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities , the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one , and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy ( as fantasy it is ) . is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility ? not that i can see
1	i rented this ( sigh ) several years ago , liked it or julia roberts enough to buy it but did n't open the new copy until the other day and watched it today . i regretted buying a new copy after all , remembering it only as a few heartwarming ( i did n't want my heart warmed ) months in the lives of just plain folks in ct. ( incidentally , the 3 girls are not sisters , just 2 of them . ) i made fun of it , my friend made fun of it , i watched a few minutes then turned it off , then watched some more , finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it . it has charm . it is a soap opera , but i thought it was well acted and well done . it had humor , happiness , sadness , embarrassment ( like the barrels of fish in the rich kid 's car ) , love . it had so much plot that it practically had none at all . and i liked it . but now , 15 minutes later , i 'm beginning all over again to wonder why i bought it . i could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick . that man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all , no range , no depth , somehow he could carry a tune , but that 's about the size of it , speaking of size , the size of his ego ( which i assume is why he did n't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics ) would have made a mushroom cloud ! i recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing . for it 's kind , i thought it was perfectly done . i just like them a smidge more sophisticated . the vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious .
1	great improvements over the original dvd . enhanced for 16x9 tvs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2.35:1 widescreen ratio . the original dvd claims an aspect ratio of `` approximately 2.35:1 '' which was not true . i own both versions and have compared viewing aspects of each . clearly this dvd is far superior and well worth the purchase price . this plays very well on my hdtv monitor ; i 'll give the old version to someone w/ an old 4x3 tv .
1	ladies in lavender is a rare gem in the movie world of today . this is a soft spoken tale that ignores age and looks to character . beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful ladies , judi dench and maggie smith , take on those roles . this movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection . the movie takes place in a small cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation - perhaps isolation from life , from emotions and from vulnerabilities . the sisters ursula and janet widdington , played by dench and smith , spend a quiet , uninvolved existence , venturing out rarely . but on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm . a bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate . this one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions , feelings that have been hidden for so many years . it is the ability of dench and smith to portray these emotions , these feelings , for the camera that make this movie sing . and the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by daniel bruhl and natascha mcelhone . together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening 's entertainment .
1	hi folks , the movies all look very good..and there are a nice group of bonus features from vintage featurettes to commentaries ! on macao ... i particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with jane russell and robert mitchum that robert osborne conducted ... very late in the life of mr mitchum . the packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great robert mitchum at under $ 10 each on dvd w/bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal ! the movies are n't generally considered mitchum 's best or best known but when you consider you 've got jean simmons as a costar and otto preminger directing angel face , josef von sternberg helming macao , vincent minnelli directing home from the hill , the great fred zinneman directing and the legend deborah kerr co-starring in the sundowners ... you can figure this is n't the bottom of the barrel either ! oh and sydney pollack directed the yakuza and contributes a great commentary ... . to sum up ... warner bros ... continues to deliver the very best classic titles on dvd with the best combination of quality transfers/bonus features and value packages ! ! ! !
0	ok , the original is a classic and is what ... 90 ... 100 minutes long ? jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story . the native were scary . the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions , they actually made him into a character ... something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters . the insect scenes are ridiculous ! ! the dinosaur stampede was idiotic . anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie . now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with ? ! ? peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
0	2 1/2 stars . this is a very good concert teaming up a pre- '' grammy '' santana with wayne shorter of weather report fame . great rhythm section , drums , conga , timbale . top notch musicians , first rate performance , very entertaining . my big problem comes with the quality of the dvd . i do n't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states dd 2.0 , dd 5.1 and dts , the menus are showing something else ( dd2.0 , dts 2.0 and dts 5.1 ) but neither dts stream seem to be working . only dd stereo works . i own close to 200 dvd 's and all work fine , dts and all . bought it directly from amazon , i had it replaced and the new one is the same . this is not part of the great live at montreux series productions which are all great , no matter how old the concert is . so the 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star dvd quality .
